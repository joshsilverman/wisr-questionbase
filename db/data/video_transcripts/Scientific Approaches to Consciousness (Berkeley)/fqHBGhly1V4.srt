00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,350
okay let's start off of what you really
want to hear about which is the final

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,110
exams

4
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:16,630
um... for that's the first

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,890
that's the tuesday of exam week

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,849
from three to six p m

7
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:24,039
the exam itself is going to be a two
hour exam but you'll have three hours to

8
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,069
do it because that's what we do things
here

9
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:30,109
and it'll be up there are two thirty
seven percent

10
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:34,810
that's right next to the swimming pool
soul bring your suits

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,240
quality as peace through this

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,280
i haven't heard yet

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,110
d d_s_p_ offers

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,550
voucher arrangements bunch

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,870
still working on it

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,820
as soon as i phone

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,290
get the information from them all paid
for them to you

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,510
also tougher stalwart of the exam is
going to be a non culated exam will

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,900
cover all the material since the midterm

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,079
the second hour will be cumulative that
will give you a chance to apply

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,650
the whole thing together

22
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,230
uh... a little bit

23
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,530
and a bit dog

24
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,740
to a recession on the wednesday of the
reading period

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,460
or there are regular class time ten to
eleven

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,680
right here at our regular classroom

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,400
i'm not going to do a formal review at
that time they'll be you know

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,030
radio in order for you with into the
course website

29
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,009
but if you have any questions you'll be
able to bring them

30
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,430
to that session

31
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,410
so here's what the exams to look like
non-committal portion worth fifty points

32
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,360
will cover everything since the last
midterm

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,710
peculiar portion worth another fifty
points will cover

34
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,920
the offers pour the course

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,920
and so roles mystery of consciousness
and also collages

36
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,419
lots of resources for the exam he got
this to win a session no muchos gracias

37
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:59,050
fortress supplements for all the old
exams are posted

38
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,120
onto the of website

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,170
i'm working on the narrative review for
the final right now

40
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,610
that'll be posted by

41
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,130
friday

42
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,459
called and

43
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,979
on dads always there will be all set

44
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,260
special forum on these days for
questions of

45
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,069
lead up to the final exam

46
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:19,700
and if you have any questions of for
some reason don't get answered

47
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,059
post m_t_v_ of these days forum

48
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,639
by monday may ninth

49
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,290
and if you do that

50
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,339
for by the end of business

51
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:29,779
birthday

52
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:33,689
i don't bring blue books for the final
exam you do everything on the exam

53
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:35,619
itself

54
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:38,840
double supplied

55
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,849
anything quick about the final exam

56
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:47,849
sold very straightforward it's just

57
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:51,629
alm

58
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,159
i've often in the past had a couple of
questions that were a little bit longer

59
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,219
in the scope

60
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,470
but if you look at all

61
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,389
passed final exam

62
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:06,529
that looked like

63
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:09,359
the science of consciousness changes
from year to year but the questions

64
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,469
about consciousness dot

65
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:15,579
who's got it who doesn't have it how do
we know

66
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:21,389
that's what it's all about

67
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:22,650
okay

68
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,469
let's talk about

69
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:27,589
we've talked in this could be in this
class mostly about consciousness and

70
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:29,829
what it is and how we know

71
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:32,489
on now what we want to do talk about

72
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:33,279
on

73
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,019
where consciousness comes from

74
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:36,299
how we got it

75
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,939
and how we know about that

76
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:43,400
so these are questions about the
development of consciousness

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,279
and went psychologists another cognitive
scientist talk about all the talk about

78
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,019
development

79
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,069
usually talk about it

80
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:51,839
one of three ways

81
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:56,539
and we're going to had on all three of
these ways some of this week

82
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:00,589
orders of flight would genetic view of
development that basically tries to

83
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:02,200
trace the evolution

84
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,269
on song characteristic

85
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:07,319
or whether it's a physical
characteristic or a mental

86
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:07,909
characteristic

87
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:12,869
this is basically for the job over for
fuel donors comparative psychology

88
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,360
which tries to

89
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,140
compare

90
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,060
mental abilities and our various law

91
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,589
various species of animals

92
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:26,059
and the question there is we've got it
we know we've got consciousness

93
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,569
but to all who else has it

94
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:30,039
all in the animal kingdom

95
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,620
dot how would we know

96
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,650
the second which is more familiar to
most of you probably

97
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,289
is the odd road genetic view

98
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:38,689
or both of development

99
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:41,499
which basically six to trace the

100
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:44,259
dog deal

101
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:44,919
concours

102
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,919
of the development of psalm
characteristics on trait

103
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:52,350
with involved life span of the
individual

104
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,699
through the birth of death so again this
is they see the province of what's known

105
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,710
as life span developmental psychology

106
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,240
all of them will talk about their own
what would promote onto genetic use of

107
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,900
the development of consciousness

108
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,059
all this week

109
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:08,719
and then finally their resolve cultural
view of development

110
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:12,110
that basically it looks at via fax
solved

111
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,750
social and cultural development upon

112
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,970
the go all the characteristics of the
mind and behavior

113
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,019
all of the author of the individual

114
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,989
this is essentially the problem solved

115
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,990
sociology and anthropology and other
social sciences

116
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,069
but it's been imported into or
psychology or recently

117
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:35,110
with interest in cultural psychology
cultural of them cultural cognition

118
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,350
and so on

119
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,979
and towards the end of the lecture on
wednesday

120
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:41,089
all have a couple things to say about

121
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:43,589
the development of consciousness

122
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:46,270
in historical time

123
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,770
but for now let's look at

124
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,039
the of why would you like view of
consciousness

125
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,500
and a problem the really goes back to
our

126
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,080
by the back to descartes

127
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,559
you'll remember that

128
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:02,630
descartes argued that there was this
qualitative separation between

129
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,520
men between human beings

130
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,020
and bill

131
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,169
and other about no other animals

132
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:10,739
giving rise to his doctrine on substance
dualism

133
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:14,109
and four descartes battles were just
reflex machines

134
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:16,199
there was no stimulus in the environment

135
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,090
which was taken up into their nervous
system in the reflected back out into

136
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,130
the environment in behavior

137
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,610
that's where the concept of the reflex
of the comes from

138
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,770
all but they card argued that humans had
sort of cubans out all these animal

139
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,830
characteristics we are reflexes two but
we also had mines

140
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,599
and consciousness

141
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:36,710
free will

142
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,330
which all of the which settles apart

143
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,749
promo other animals

144
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:42,669
so all of them

145
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,930
you can say for what

146
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,280
former cartesian point-of-view that
humans are the highest stage of

147
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,469
development

148
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:53,180
home just look kind of just world will
build less than uh... guardian angels

149
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,269
all but that there is is qualitatively

150
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:57,380
or between

151
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,529
or or other animals and humans which is
that we've got consciousness

152
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:02,739
and they don't

153
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:05,759
so jake hard answers the question

154
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,190
the pilot genetic

155
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,050
phone of the development of
consciousness which basically says

156
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,110
there is a dead heat

157
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,340
file a genetic followed by development

158
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,300
small only or all the humans have it and
there's just no point

159
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,810
looking for a in order

160
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,509
well in other species

161
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:28,840
all idea of the all a good god dealt a
serious blow in the nineteenth century

162
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,229
by charles darwin on and his old man and
his own

163
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:34,939
some old paul

164
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:37,960
treatise on the origin of species by
natural selection

165
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,560
who argue that i'm not going to give you
a whole darwinian thing here but that

166
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,160
the essentially all the darwin argued
for the continuity

167
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,340
of species

168
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,090
that is that human beings

169
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,389
and all other rattles

170
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,029
shared in common on some kind of common
ancestor

171
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,800
all and uh... and that

172
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,310
with two countries

173
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,439
all of the the roots of any species back

174
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,040
all along

175
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,500
way of evolution

176
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,329
replied

177
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:04,260
now darwin himself

178
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,780
mostly applied

179
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,179
this doctrine called evolution by
natural selection and especially

180
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:16,199
this doctor and all of the evolutionary
continuity of species to body parts

181
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,549
morphological similarity

182
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:22,439
why do we have two arms into legacy is
for descended from fish that have

183
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,189
all but darwin was also interested in

184
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:27,929
in mental similarity

185
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:30,330
and suggested that you couldn't see

186
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,440
continuity as he could see traces of
koppel of dissent from a common ancestor

187
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,120
all valued in the fact

188
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,469
that older adults

189
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,600
shared sit with the shared some of the
mental traits

190
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,159
all with

191
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,210
well with those human spirit is

192
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,829
are very clearly in his late

193
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:48,510
treatise on the percent of man

194
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,180
the difference in mind between man and a
higher animals

195
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,519
great as it is

196
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,860
is certainly one of the greedy

197
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,810
not kind

198
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,100
quantitative difference we've got more
of something that someone around adults

199
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,970
perhaps

200
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,410
but there is no cartesian qualitative
difference

201
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,890
on that's the essential doctrine of
evolutionary continuity

202
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,470
let me just kind of goes on all of them
about this

203
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,949
that it could be proved that for quite
helpful powers such as consciousness for

204
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,280
absolutely for a man

205
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,180
which seems extremely doubtful

206
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,450
then that would be trouble

207
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,210
all for their own

208
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,900
darwin

209
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,090
call but he says that the home

210
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,939
all of that sort of aleutian

211
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:33,399
or not to be denied because we see it
all of

212
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,880
what all the time

213
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,230
in another round

214
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,960
thomas huxley sometimes known as
darwin's bulldog

215
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,460
or more vigorous

216
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,210
more vigorous in the defense of
darwinian theory then darwin himself was

217
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,940
on although the book up this problem
when it was only writing about

218
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,840
consciousness

219
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,070
headed back to you

220
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,389
laws and that he argued

221
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:57,310
that consciousness of blinks

222
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,460
would appear to be related to the
mechanism of their bodies

223
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,379
simply as a collateral

224
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:03,790
product of its working

225
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,670
and to be completely without any power
of modify networking

226
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,250
as the steam whistle which accompanies
the workable locomotive engine

227
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,279
is without influence opponents machinery
that's the classic statement

228
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,630
of apple phenomenal ism

229
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,100
but noticed what huxley site here

230
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,089
he's talking about

231
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,980
da consciousness or brutes

232
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,650
okay he's not talking about human
consciousness

233
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,059
uh... which suggests

234
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:30,940
that may be

235
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,989
human consciousness

236
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:33,810
is not up a phenomenal

237
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,950
even if nonhuman consciousness along
with it so there is a op

238
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,200
there's love

239
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,710
about the hypothesis about evolutionary
continuity there

240
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,330
all of that week and the c

241
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,640
significant if they can get translated
into into some kind of research

242
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,870
all beginning with the publication of
darwin's work

243
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,720
the on nineteen th century psychologist
a bunch of nineteenth century

244
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,240
psychologist

245
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,760
began to take up

246
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,780
feel though they are the implications of
darwin's doctrine or evolutionary

247
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,560
continuity with respect to

248
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,139
with respect to mine

249
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,680
and began talking about

250
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,300
animal intelligence

251
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,510
animal mind

252
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,810
animal consciousness

253
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,550
are based on the idea that

254
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,989
if humans have minds

255
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:21,540
than somebody else want to have mine too

256
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,650
especially those animals

257
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,360
uh... with which we share

258
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,400
approval nearby common ancestry

259
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,860
and so dogwood did begin actually with
this guy george rome honest that's what

260
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,070
it looks like

261
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,649
all of the romana so-called assembled

262
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,570
a whole bunch of anecdotal evidence

263
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,930
about or org

264
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,749
that seem to suggest that moves pad

265
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:43,390
intelligence

266
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,870
worksop reading just by reflex are
conditioned response

267
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,810
of course he didn't know anything about
conditioned response thought that this

268
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,990
is a teeny tubes long before pavlov

269
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,039
our budget

270
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:58,280
the hope that they'd instinct reflects
on

271
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,700
there's a wonderful story about a broad
bringing his food dish to his master

272
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,580
als

273
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,130
and there is little story for example
about all

274
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,190
baboons attacking humans in the home

275
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,440
in the jungle

276
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,890
and uh... they seem to be laxity
planning and coordinating their attacked

277
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,190
not just uh... rampaging as well

278
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,610
as individuals

279
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,750
agra labas even suggested that he saw
evidence of

280
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,390
fellow feeling and sympathy in ads

281
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,170
are where one at would help another one
already bowl ordering a picnic or

282
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,080
whatever

283
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,820
sources this observation seems if
unequivocal

284
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,689
as proving fellow feeling

285
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:35,630
and sympathy

286
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,390
so far as we can trace any analogy
between the emotions of the higher

287
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:44,490
raffles and those of insects so robot
has his taking darwin's doctrine of

288
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,410
evolutionary condo would be quite

289
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,500
quite seriously

290
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,279
and saying

291
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,920
i think we can see evidence

292
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,700
with things like consciousness

293
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,029
or you know

294
00:12:55,029 --> 00:12:59,230
nonhuman animals

295
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:04,280
so there's role models as idea about
mental evolution of man who says look

296
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,290
it's just not

297
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,120
very likely

298
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,439
all of the body called is that the
show's evolutionary continuity

299
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:14,330
but that the mind doesn't

300
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,850
not least because

301
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,519
the mind of the body of related

302
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,930
in various ways

303
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,990
and he argued on the basis of his
anecdotal evidence

304
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,610
that poem that there's been

305
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,970
no interruption

306
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,410
in the developmental process that is no
qualitatively

307
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,320
quantum leap

308
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,440
all between all between or the raffles
laws

309
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,390
but that the mind of mad like the mind
of animals

310
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,000
has off

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,790
has evolved that was ramanrsood position

312
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,070
this book is still read

313
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,310
stillman though

314
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,330
uh... it fell to his organs don't
actually

315
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,100
policy void were going to say not so
fast

316
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,190
and he said look

317
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,740
love their guns out there a real
problems with attributing minds to

318
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,390
apples

319
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,470
not least because it seems to violate
the law

320
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,650
parcel moni

321
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,269
part of that

322
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:06,940
they corny and prescription that the
simplest explanation is always the best

323
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,530
exploration

324
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,540
and he said what you want to do big
there before you were started shooting

325
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,489
mind outils

326
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:14,459
you want to take care to make sure

327
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,110
that you could rule out

328
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,140
all of the hypothesis that their
behaviors the product of some kind of

329
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,630
instinct

330
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,200
for maybe a product of troy alone

331
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,840
trial and error learning

332
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,370
and so what morgan left us with what's
nao known as lloyd morgan's cabin

333
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,079
which is that

334
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,109
if you're looking at drug try to
understand behavior

335
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:35,900
you should always stop orton interpret
behavior

336
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,959
in terms of the lowest

337
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:42,280
possible psychological process again is
kind of they called me in

338
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,100
the korean parcel

339
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,239
on so that if you can if you can
attribute

340
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:50,339
a author of the some behavior toward
instinct or the trilateral learning

341
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:51,490
you should do that

342
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,670
and not start thinking

343
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,680
or have been conscious thoughts of
gauging conscious problem solved

344
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,700
there was one actually the interesting
corollary to avoid morgan's cannon

345
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,630
which set

346
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,180
all the stage for the behaviorist
revolution in new york

347
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,000
give your we twentieth century

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,940
which is his idea

349
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,629
and this is basically a quote here

350
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:13,110
by human process

351
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,269
is scientifically interesting

352
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:16,289
truly extent

353
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:20,520
that it can be studied in animals

354
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,540
also that just forget about that will
prevent much human research study that

355
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,780
animals instead

356
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:31,170
that won't talk about rather than talk
about a century for vote before world

357
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,560
people who say instead of us not quite
right

358
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,930
and in fact uh... jack your guard

359
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,140
probably check overdone at stanford

360
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,099
suggested that virtue actually reversed

361
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:43,610
void morgan's

362
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,729
and say that

363
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:45,659
animal research

364
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:47,250
is scientifically interesting

365
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,470
or lead to the extent

366
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,470
that it tells us something about human
mind of behavior

367
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,690
which is kind of an interesting

368
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,180
interesting proposition special point
here is

369
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:02,389
that powell or whereas rum on us was
quite happy to attribute mind

370
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:04,029
unconsciousness even tap dance

371
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,420
will barely have a nervous system

372
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,740
of along with his student word morgan

373
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,189
or was uh... what was sold some what
uh...

374
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:14,140
were more conservative

375
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,360
in this respect

376
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,059
as was john watson

377
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,170
or that the

378
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,000
famous founder of behavior isn't

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,700
all who who argued in his own

380
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,020
uni's revolutionary

381
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,520
that basically consciousness and
intelligence played no role in that will

382
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,970
be here who are at all

383
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,999
when we see animals they

384
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,890
they're behaving entirely hazchem

385
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,150
reflex and instinct

386
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,100
response

387
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,150
and if you pick darwin's fault of the
principle of evolutionary continuity

388
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,850
seriously

389
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,570
the implication of this is that

390
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,040
ip animals don't have consciousness

391
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,110
than humans don't either

392
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,790
right that be a bit the evolutionary
continuity goes the other way

393
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,249
oh and watson

394
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,200
a stab list behavior ism

395
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,440
of what the point of view

396
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,960
but you can understand

397
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,760
the all of the the behaviors of human

398
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,130
animals

399
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,630
the same way we understand the behaviors
nonhuman animals

400
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,300
in terms of instinct

401
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,280
and reflex

402
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,460
condition

403
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,440
conditioned response

404
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,870
all of this is to say

405
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,579
darwinian evolutionary continuity is
fine

406
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,819
but there is kind of a paradox tulip i
think that that's not good it's not

407
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,650
clear exactly what we on

408
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,919
for resposta make

409
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,210
out of this idea of evolutionary conway

410
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,780
everybody seems to agree

411
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,570
that there is evolutionary continuity
that applies to the mine

412
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,240
behavior

413
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,120
as well as to as well as the body
morphology

414
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,610
but the implications of that differ from
one person wannatter

415
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,920
romana said

416
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,720
but we want to do is to take human
intelligence unconsciousness

417
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,840
an extended down

418
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,240
to bother

419
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,360
nonhuman animals

420
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,030
whereas ford ikon walks in

421
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,020
wanted to say well look adult behavior
is just behavior there's no

422
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,150
consciousness there

423
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,840
and then they kind of extend this lack
of consciousness

424
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,430
or two

425
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,760
uh... cases

426
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,660
so it has to be said that lloydmorgan
himself

427
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,340
did say that there were some

428
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,690
mental capacities that seemed to be
exclusively human

429
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,260
and those people it was only supposed to
be

430
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,150
that had to do with language

431
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,420
followed

432
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,740
the next person here talk about business
world but very interesting person marble

433
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,130
floor in washington

434
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,620
or was the first woman during a p_h_d_
in psychology

435
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,220
hall and also lol

436
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,980
under lee president of the american
psychological association such a big

437
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,870
psychologist

438
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,980
all the very best very very prominent

439
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,620
and washburn took up this issue with
that romano sendawal and and and others

440
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,610
had done that

441
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,740
had been debating

442
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,600
and said look

443
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,420
if you think about it for a second

444
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,130
the problem called inferring
consciousness and all other animals

445
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,670
is really no different

446
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,450
the problem of inferring consciousness

447
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,659
in other human beings

448
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:15,720
we know were conscious as individuals

449
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,230
how do we know

450
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,830
somebody else

451
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,690
how do you know that i'm conscious y
know that your conscience dot

452
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,120
or whatever

453
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,860
that's the same problem

454
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,360
okay so the same

455
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,790
hines of data

456
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,250
that don't take as evidence of
consciousness

457
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,240
in all in another human being

458
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,760
you ought to accept

459
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,559
as evidence of consciousness

460
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,649
and other animals

461
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:43,150
as well and she says and just kind of
subsets that out here very nicely

462
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,549
or at my neighbors mine is a mystery to
me

463
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:50,240
how great is the mystery which works out
of the audience of a dog

464
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,930
very nice phrase sybil psychologist all
right with the same

465
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,310
which is really too bad

466
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,760
and how insoluble

467
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,730
the problems as entered by the mind of
an and

468
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,900
orifice fighter

469
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,420
still she thought the problem once all
your bowl

470
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,260
and it was so evil in the same way that
we part of the result

471
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,799
they'll be resolve this issue

472
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,800
with respect to

473
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,350
with respect which others

474
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,690
so washburn propose that we engage in a
mentalist a comparative psychology

475
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,890
not just comparing the behavioral
capacities of all learning abilities

476
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,630
of humans and other nonhuman creatures

477
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,910
but rather ordered are trying to
psychiatry uncover how the minds of all

478
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,220
other avenues work homework

479
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,860
oddly or some shit

480
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,380
the impact have money

481
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,350
that they're not just operating

482
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,600
on the basis of reflex

483
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,490
and conditioned response

484
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,510
and also shift all actually dot had a
critique

485
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,870
fall ball cobalt

486
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,930
uh... of the kind of evidence that we
use for this

487
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,450
suggested

488
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,179
though some some walpole nh

489
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:57,330
authors in fact robot has himself

490
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,610
had suggested that

491
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,140
whenever you see behavioral response to
stimulation

492
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,330
that indicates that there's a wind
workings of wombats

493
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,640
that person

494
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,429
all

495
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:12,679
all other are of nineteenth century
psychologist had to have been for mines

496
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:13,900
in animals

497
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,500
over the fact that they gave approach
avoidance behaviors so well that doesn't

498
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,620
necessarily mean that there's a lot
either

499
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,600
or the variability of the pages twelve
period only could come from lots of

500
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,539
places

501
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:26,700
in the end

502
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,040
what the farm

503
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,940
what washburn suggested

504
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,460
was that there were two criteria to
aspects of animals

505
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,399
for part of that uh... that that

506
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:38,120
that convinced her at least

507
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,170
that there was some evidence pole vault

508
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,350
or intelligence and consciousness

509
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,380
and first was what you called anatomical
resemblance to humans

510
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,030
fled the war of the brain all been
animal

511
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,900
looks like a human brain

512
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,320
the more likely it is

513
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,220
brain supports consciousness

514
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,000
so if you got loads of god

515
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,430
folds and they got all the stuff that

516
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,289
the all the features of human brain seem
to have

517
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:08,500
then you can start thinking about about
that adult having consciousness

518
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,980
but if the aval has already pleaded for
brain structure

519
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,470
for example

520
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,780
answers fighters who

521
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,520
really don't have brains they just got a
bunch of ganglia

522
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,310
know about

523
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,240
well then

524
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,720
though the maybe that's just too far

525
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,150
or too far down the evolutionary tree

526
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:32,220
and the other side the elder ralph idea
was this one of the rapid learning

527
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,080
on she wrote that she argued that

528
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,910
if a bit of a novel learns

529
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,010
really really quickly

530
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,280
kimba it must be learning

531
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,300
by virtue of some process or other then

532
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,750
simple choice whatever

533
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,510
and that maybe there is some kind of

534
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,780
all problem solving or insider
hypothesis testing

535
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,640
going on

536
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,430
and in fact the stories of psychology
now or that suggests

537
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,200
that it was more report washburn who was
the direct oregon

538
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,650
of watson's behaviorist

539
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,290
the old idea was that he was actually
read rebelling against

540
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,570
against thorndike

541
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,480
all but in fact

542
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,440
made very well have been

543
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,700
washburn zone

544
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,820
willingness to entertain

545
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,220
consciousness and animals

546
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,870
on that really septal

547
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,760
such a little

548
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,860
so how to make

549
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,130
well darwin himself had actually thought
about this

550
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,060
and proposed a test

551
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:33,070
all volvo or with which we now know and
show you what does the miracles but so

552
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,380
far

553
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,300
or darwin paul in his uh...

554
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,040
confirmed what the fed to them you could

555
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,170
tells the story

556
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:46,250
all bob watching around the kinds of who
are were held listed

557
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,900
house in the london zoo

558
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,720
and who had been are given a mirror

559
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,510
one of the put in the cage

560
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,090
and he uh... trays

561
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,640
all of these on stage is this a dot of a
ragtag cornstarch chimpanzee

562
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,400
on above the three stages of response

563
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,940
the animals were very surprised

564
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,420
or a at this object

565
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,580
or they were very curious about it

566
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:13,160
on then later on they began to get used
to it that weekend

567
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,580
remiss at it

568
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:19,930
and uh... actually sort of casino aborn
point almost as if we were or another

569
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,259
love

570
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,630
and other allele

571
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,390
on and then they or that eventually they

572
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,630
the the store

573
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,650
just ignored it

574
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:32,120
so dard was really interested in this
response all the chip abiyoyo above the

575
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,190
arrived at times

576
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,679
plugged into this matter

577
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,110
because that's the big because of
suggested to him that may be

578
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,820
uh... they were seen themselves there
recognize that the that the mirror

579
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,680
images were images of themselves but he
really didn't

580
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,830
the whole of look at this sort of
systematically

581
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,690
or so

582
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,560
you don't really know from darwin's
aliquot

583
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,030
whether these animals will reacting to
the mirror image as if it were another

584
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,200
eight cause harangues

585
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,400
spent a lot of time grimacing and
kissing each other

586
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,210
part

587
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:02,830
or

588
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,929
whether they were actually using the
mirror

589
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:08,820
onto our building to get information
about what they themselves uh... looked

590
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,270
like

591
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,220
but anyway there it is eighteen seventy
one just kinda sits there in the

592
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,210
literature

593
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,340
four all hundred years

594
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,330
untenable

595
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,820
farmville gordon gallup a professor at
the other state university of new york

596
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,120
at albany

597
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,660
decided that he was going to do darwin's
test and do it

598
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,190
director of the systematically

599
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,620
yeah but not gallup assault
climatologist he had access to a bunch

600
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,290
of chimpanzees

601
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,669
and what he did was to arm

602
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:37,980
but when they just kind of put a mirror
alive in their cages

603
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,240
of the same way that as had been done at
the london zoo

604
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,980
and he had to old

605
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,560
i'm going to be made observations that
were very similar to what uh... uh...

606
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,580
darwin had observed

607
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,850
i said of the michelly the chimpanzees
would explore the mirror and they seem

608
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,690
to react to the mirror image of zipper
were another animal

609
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,620
steady detriment reversing identical

610
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,809
and so on

611
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,500
but later although gallup observed

612
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,110
the animals would actually

613
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:07,429
use the mirror to explore themselves

614
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:10,479
volvo that they seem to react to the
mirror image

615
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:14,980
as if it were sold representation of
what they themselves looked like

616
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,860
they used america grew

617
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,570
bar body parts that they couldn't see

618
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,600
pork what that andy further

619
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,740
fall bay are used it to walk out the
pick their teeth

620
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,370
called they did all sorts of things are
there

621
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,120
big including

622
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,790
come characteristic chimpanzee behavior
of nose picking

623
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,470
chimpanzees do this

624
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,860
a great deal these chimpanzees weapons

625
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:47,860
winds have been made one of the pic

626
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,620
but that's that's a fact

627
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,030
is that significant

628
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,890
will see the second

629
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:59,500
of their yours your slightly ahead of me

630
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,640
and so here is actually barbuda gallup
psalm

631
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,350
twelve gallup stayed up

632
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,309
also

633
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:07,460
in in the blue you have

634
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,170
reactions of

635
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,360
to dubs and to build into the image in
the mirror

636
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,950
and in the green you have reactions to
the sell to the using the image

637
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,500
uh... using american room themselves

638
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,670
and you can see over

639
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,220
number of days of exposure

640
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,520
all reacting to the mirrors view mirror
image as if it's another animal

641
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,600
goes down

642
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,870
fairly quickly

643
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:33,230
and reacting to the mirror images if
it's an image of themselves

644
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,539
of point uh...

645
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:35,790
white progressively

646
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,389
but that of course

647
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,059
that's not

648
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:40,020
rooms could not completely clear what

649
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,950
lovable what what's going on there

650
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,920
on gallup then all invented would be
part of this

651
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,690
or that we now in use

652
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,559
known as the mirror recognition program

653
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,540
but the chimpanzees

654
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,500
anesthetized them

655
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,300
all

656
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,520
all of these are production pansies
would already had quite a bit of

657
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,180
experience with the mirror

658
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,980
ten days

659
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,690
bong over not surprisingly while they
were on conscious

660
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,350
applauded or color all other arnold
earlist although the paint

661
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,870
to their own for their farms

662
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,190
they were not surprised that they would
realize this is going on in this order

663
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,360
list so they couldn't smell distance
bill

664
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,350
visual dad

665
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:24,789
and then the animals were allowed to of
cause of come out of the anesthesia

666
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:27,220
onto the cage with the mir were present

667
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,669
and what the poem

668
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:30,179
delegated

669
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:33,940
was to again look at mirror directed
behaviors that his behaviors directed

670
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,630
towards the image as if it were another
chimpanzee

671
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,290
self-directed behaviors or as before

672
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,760
and then finally or whether the animals
or actually

673
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,840
looked in the mirror and touched a spot

674
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,049
and there's a control group of all of
the chimpanzees who had no prior

675
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:55,130
experience with the mirror and there are
the results

676
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,730
solo on the brawl

677
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:03,710
what you can see here

678
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,250
you can see that there is

679
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,440
buried at the very beginning to
experiment

680
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,790
walk home responses to the mirror very
few responses to themselves

681
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,990
at the end

682
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,429
no very few responses to the mirror

683
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:19,350
lots of responses for themselves

684
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,690
but what you can see here

685
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,360
mobile all most of these animals

686
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,860
were actually using american inspect
them selves when they saw this spot

687
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,580
state touch

688
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,330
the spot on their own

689
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,100
boren's

690
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,830
vara making it very clear

691
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,390
they understood

692
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,440
what would have never seen in the out in
the mirror was an image of themselves

693
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,500
and that they now look different

694
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,900
uh... dudley houston here's the behavior
for the animals with had no prior your

695
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,610
exposure

696
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,400
there was a things we know touching

697
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,890
of the morris all by uh... by those
animals

698
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,809
on the gallup includes

699
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,409
that chimpanzees show

700
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:59,190
uh... recognition of themselves and off

701
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,980
in a mirror and he went on to do some
other studies have all of the give other

702
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,130
investigators suggesting

703
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,279
that this is the behavior that is almost
unique

704
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,470
too

705
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,320
to look at the chimpanzees

706
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,080
mcc acts of various kinds don't do it
rhesus monkeys song

707
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,880
don't do it

708
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,820
they said look what you're seeing here

709
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,820
is evidence of self-awareness

710
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,640
self-consciousness

711
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,080
in chimpanzees

712
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,380
pressed their matching

713
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,700
sensory experience or perceptual
experience

714
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,250
with some internal representation

715
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,560
of themselves

716
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,579
fallen are gallup argued

717
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:37,900
implies both of you have a concept
itself

718
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:43,180
they have some idea about what they
looked like

719
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,860
and their their own

720
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,570
there where

721
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,980
of this concept

722
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,780
capable but would have to be around his
own

723
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,690
inference do this as well all of this is
were quite nielsen

724
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,820
and and and and his colleagues

725
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,600
and looking at mirror so the development
of marisol recognition onto a

726
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,430
genetically

727
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,350
inhuman infants

728
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,120
it's this crap right here

729
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,669
and somewhere between the ages eighteen

730
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,330
and and and twenty four months

731
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,900
the majority of human infants will show

732
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,030
behavior in the mirror

733
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,010
they were going to be here

734
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,410
just like the chimpanzee

735
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,940
so now we're looking at

736
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,720
some of the development of consciousness

737
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,470
onto a genetically

738
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,039
around

739
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,280
twelve months of age one year of age

740
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,480
not too much beer itself recognition

741
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,960
by about a year-and-a-half procedures

742
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,019
job of age

743
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:43,019
you're getting this village so pretty

744
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,950
experiment drove certain

745
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,160
animal behaviorist

746
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,000
we're just not prepared

747
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,480
to admit

748
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,620
artful

749
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,010
the any kind of consciousness or
awareness self-concept or anything like

750
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,799
that

751
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,950
and the revulsion critics of the sort of
a bit of these

752
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,890
of of these experience

753
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,620
basically said well you and that's the
ties the animals when you would not

754
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,950
surprise the apples and it's brought
their face budget behavior

755
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,090
fall bs ad-hoc criticism

756
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,350
but the actual responses

757
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:22,800
let's solve the let's see if this is
just a part of packed them for old balls

758
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,490
of kind of bob random face prachi

759
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,220
by looking at

760
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,140
marked the bond market areas on the
chimpanzee face

761
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,890
so will the market area

762
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,160
over one

763
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,900
on the

764
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,650
one-year and then look at

765
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,950
whether they are able

766
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,059
the two eyes

767
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,740
or the potential over the two wise
equally for the two leaders equally

768
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,110
that would suggest is just random
behavior

769
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,290
or whether they focus on

770
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,320
on the actual marked area

771
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,140
all this work was done by daniel paul
van elliott is that the louisiana state

772
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,150
university

773
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,700
who's probably doubling the

774
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,420
best work on god's green earth on
primate

775
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,830
cognition

776
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,420
on at the moment

777
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,669
fallen and you can see here

778
00:33:06,669 --> 00:33:12,190
that poem

779
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,630
these are control animals

780
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,889
all who all who don't have any

781
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:17,950
exposure to the mirror

782
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,750
these are out of those who've had some
exposure to the mir and yes they push

783
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,889
their faces a lot

784
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:25,860
but they're cochin around the marcus a
specific

785
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,320
behavior

786
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,440
that has to do

787
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,730
or with the more

788
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,889
and that's true when you just count
touches

789
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:31,860
and it's true

790
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,160
when you look at the amount of time they
spend touching

791
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,320
various parts horrible of their body

792
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,579
so this seems now to be

793
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:42,790
discriminative behavior on the part of
these animals

794
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,200
that is directed

795
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,860
towards the mark portion

796
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,159
of their faces

797
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,930
which seems to really suggest

798
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,140
that they have some concept of what they
look like

799
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,970
you're aware of this concept

800
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,820
they're aware of the mismatch between
what they see

801
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,410
all and what

802
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,760
and what they expect

803
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,390
all here's some nice photographs from
over nellie

804
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,150
here's some the chimpanzees

805
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,360
who are

806
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,909
making contingent body movements

807
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:10,570
they'll approach the miller

808
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,699
from flight

809
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:14,159
until there

810
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,019
although appearing on the move around a
lot very interesting behavior

811
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:22,229
til seven for the mirrors bellowed make
smiles and grimaces and stick out their

812
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,529
problems and

813
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:28,009
do all sorts of things like that and
there's gauge of various kinds of

814
00:34:28,009 --> 00:34:34,079
exploratory behaviors

815
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,179
comment only made an astounding

816
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,840
and uh... but uh... vishal discovery

817
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:44,449
which is that you don't see this
behavior and all chimpanzees

818
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,889
you seem very self recognition

819
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:51,609
every human infant as about abide by the
time it reaches about the age of

820
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:52,940
twenty four months

821
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,349
but in fact you always see mir were self
recognition in a minority

822
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:00,189
of chimpanzees

823
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:02,969
auto almost all of almost a hundred

824
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:07,609
chips that over that we tested the
status

825
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:09,449
that subject

826
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:12,390
proposal before down there

827
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,109
only about twenty one

828
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:16,400
or all the you know orval

829
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,429
more than

830
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:19,949
almost ninety all weird or so

831
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:21,380
dot chimpanzees

832
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,059
regularly show this song

833
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,499
brooding showed this behavior

834
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:25,319
in fact

835
00:35:25,319 --> 00:35:29,619
the vast majority of chimpanzees
importantly such

836
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:32,069
study didn't show

837
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:36,329
this very self recognition so you can
get it in chimpanzees

838
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:40,049
you getting a lot more than just one
crummy

839
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:42,440
okay that's important

840
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,229
but it turns out that the evidence for
mera self recognition chimpanzees has

841
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,949
been somewhat overstated

842
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:50,399
tears

843
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:54,559
the impression they get in textbooks is
that jan pansy show this

844
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,569
all but the uh... were correct of the
statement would be

845
00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:00,270
chimpanzees

846
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,889
shoulders

847
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:07,380
sonam let's get back to your question
who could we see this it

848
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,029
we see on yourself recognition and older
chimpanzees

849
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:14,279
chimpanzees have been raised in groups

850
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:17,649
and chimpanzees who have prior
experience with the mirror

851
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:20,940
you tend not to see it in younger
chimpanzees

852
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,130
or in a really old chimpanzees

853
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,169
you got to be a middle-aged chimpanzee
ice

854
00:36:27,169 --> 00:36:30,879
you don't see any inch and panties were
raised in isolation

855
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:32,289
on it and you don't see it

856
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:36,219
in chimpanzees who have not had prior
experience

857
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:37,249
with the bear

858
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:43,279
if you do get some evidence on their
issac recognition interact attacks

859
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:48,139
now nobody's done the kind of extensive
study of a rang attends pullman ellie

860
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,420
did

861
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,019
nine-years-old chimpanzees

862
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:53,880
but it has been seen in around attacked

863
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,929
okay that's the answer

864
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:58,360
you can also see a bonobo such as well

865
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,760
sub species of

866
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,069
chimpanzees and you see it in human
infants

867
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:06,029
what you don't see it at all primates

868
00:37:06,029 --> 00:37:07,249
interestingly

869
00:37:07,249 --> 00:37:12,369
probably don't see although

870
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:14,559
yourself recognition in guerrilla ns

871
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,869
or a penny peterson the all foster balm
of the famous of gorilla koko

872
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:22,920
or suggested that or the anecdotally

873
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,769
that coco recognized

874
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:28,929
himself and further in the mirror

875
00:37:28,929 --> 00:37:34,349
a lot of actually selling with me compro

876
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:38,779
but that's just an anecdote and was a
recorder that was in a formal experiment

877
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:44,059
on and uh... with the actually haven't
seen the date on this call

878
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:46,359
from anybody else

879
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:49,019
suarez and gallup tested

880
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:49,779
guerrillas

881
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:54,789
after eighty hours of exposure to
american got no evidence of mirrors so

882
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:55,539
recognition

883
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,990
ledbetter invasion

884
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:01,460
tested to alone agoura was after a four
hundred powers

885
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,680
four hundred hours of exposure

886
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,730
or to a bear

887
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,019
and got no evidence of mirror softly

888
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:08,960
soulful

889
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,309
we don't know about that one

890
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:11,729
shabbos don't show

891
00:38:11,729 --> 00:38:14,329
of mirror so forgive recognition

892
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:15,460
monkeys don't show

893
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,419
under assault for a

894
00:38:17,419 --> 00:38:18,300
and on

895
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,859
wilder non bogdan primate all of the
species

896
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,149
deleted

897
00:38:24,149 --> 00:38:25,290
went on to the show it

898
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,819
either dole had something to say about
that

899
00:38:28,819 --> 00:38:30,259
and second

900
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:32,620
okay so what's interesting about this

901
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:37,230
is that it looks like the capacity for
self recognition that they've got that

902
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,289
that's what you want to uses evidence
for consciousness

903
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:43,630
seems to have evolved

904
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,519
independently

905
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:48,329
because it turns out that chimpanzees
are our closest

906
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:51,609
although the primate ancestor

907
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:55,729
om havoc on prominent russian pansies
before we have a common ancestor with

908
00:38:55,729 --> 00:38:58,029
uh... with guerrillas

909
00:38:58,029 --> 00:38:59,079
somehow

910
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:02,029
or rag attends got it

911
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:03,569
chimpanzees got it

912
00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:06,829
humans got it but apparently guerrillas
did

913
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:11,390
okay which is kind of interesting nobody
has any appreciably

914
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,819
explanation for this

915
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:15,150
it seems to at the seams of in the case

916
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,939
that this capacity for self recognition

917
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,269
hands on

918
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:21,359
has risen

919
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,639
at least whites and same atleast twice

920
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:31,289
about every year or so somebody will
publish followed by the blood that i i

921
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:32,650
know that the study

922
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,229
claiming to show

923
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:38,450
alot of mira self-regulation in psalm
nonhuman

924
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:42,620
or annable there are a couple of studies
out there uh... dolphins now

925
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,399
there's at least one study of elephants

926
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:46,920
wrong

927
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,509
letters i don't know cat has ever shown
marisol recognition

928
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:53,899
uh... dot i have a whole collection of

929
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:57,779
cats and probably it's about a week at
oppenheimer

930
00:39:57,779 --> 00:39:59,629
who's now gone

931
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:00,529
bom

932
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:04,169
wiped out and he naked i don't know what
he was that we were moving that day and

933
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:07,529
he was just going to be there

934
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:11,799
he was also very soon

935
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:14,069
are but in any of that

936
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:16,469
there's one dolphin

937
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:17,999
widened often

938
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,150
that's shown yourself recognition

939
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,559
and one elephant

940
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,260
that is thought that that is shown

941
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,719
mirrors so recognition

942
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,529
but nobody has done

943
00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:28,579
that kind of

944
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:30,099
comprehensive

945
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:31,209
widespread testing

946
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:36,130
of a representative sample of these
species has pulled the nellie answers to

947
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,849
a lesser extent gallup

948
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:39,679
or have done with god

949
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,969
a double chimpanzees

950
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:44,499
you cannot rule out

951
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:49,609
cats and dogs another out all of the
plug on primate animals might show on

952
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:51,099
there is hope recognition

953
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:54,359
but it's one thing to show it at one
animal

954
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,640
one but one instance of the species

955
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,489
it's another thing to make a claim

956
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:02,099
that dolphins as a species were
elephants as a species

957
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:03,919
had recognized

958
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:04,989
themselves

959
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:08,939
the question back your support

960
00:41:08,939 --> 00:41:13,159
so anyway that seems to be in story of
there

961
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,999
all of that

962
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:16,739
mera self recognition

963
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:20,169
is your criterion for consciousness

964
00:41:20,169 --> 00:41:23,059
if that's going to be used as your
behavioral tests

965
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:26,989
we know that humans have it by age to
view

966
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:30,989
some chimpanzees habit more than one

967
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:35,219
although some overall ragged tennis on
seem to have that by the end of their

968
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:36,049
this office

969
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:38,189
huge sample that's been tested

970
00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:40,409
operated things like that has been or

971
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:41,640
for chimpanzees

972
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,449
but other species

973
00:41:43,449 --> 00:41:46,599
it's not at all or it's not at all clear

974
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:48,319
for a long time

975
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,420
mirrors so recognition

976
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,469
always used as the criterion index

977
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:54,950
consciousness

978
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,269
and nine killed

979
00:41:57,269 --> 00:41:58,679
nonhuman animals

980
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,170
more recently however

981
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:04,690
there's been a lot of interest paid
through another behavioral index

982
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,919
or which had the with which has more to
do with what our developmental

983
00:42:08,919 --> 00:42:11,029
psychology or the colleagues call

984
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,339
theory of mine

985
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:16,009
consciousness the flying as a theory of
mine

986
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:20,059
this is an idea there was popularized by
developmental psychologist on stanford

987
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:21,289
john lovell

988
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,199
all based on work by loan

989
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:27,169
but ideas that came out of the work of
david prine back

990
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,859
hall and his

991
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:31,339
chimpanzees sarah

992
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:34,259
what sorry looks like

993
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:36,900
the idea behind the theory of mind

994
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,460
is that at some point

995
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,329
we understand it is not just that we
have mental state

996
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:44,869
not just that we have qualitative

997
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:49,799
states some redness and balloonists and
pain and smell and all of that

998
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:54,319
but that our mental states or
representations of other things

999
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,739
that our mental states are as james
would have put it

1000
00:42:57,739 --> 00:42:58,579
about

1001
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:00,209
things bother

1002
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:01,119
themselves

1003
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,059
and that these representations

1004
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:04,710
ordered that we have in our heads

1005
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,289
of the world outside

1006
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:07,570
may or may not

1007
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,019
the accurate

1008
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:13,809
so the first aspect of the theory of
mine comes with its recognition that are

1009
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:16,249
phenomenal experience is about something

1010
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:18,159
order that itself

1011
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:21,299
that have represents all of them
something else

1012
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:24,200
all the suck it out element of the
theory of mind

1013
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,459
is this recognition

1014
00:43:25,459 --> 00:43:28,729
that part of our people have mental
states too

1015
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:32,059
step other people have policeman fought

1016
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:33,599
feelings and desires

1017
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,649
or that are inside their heads

1018
00:43:35,649 --> 00:43:39,749
but they also may be true or false

1019
00:43:39,749 --> 00:43:41,280
and feelings and desires

1020
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,950
may be different from a role

1021
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,189
the idea that are mental states are

1022
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:48,619
a kind of personal

1023
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:51,549
consciousness

1024
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:53,769
in developmental psychology

1025
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:55,839
the palm

1026
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,469
the acquisition of a theory of why it is
commonly measured with what's known as

1027
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:00,829
the false belief

1028
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:02,679
past uh... many of you would probly had
some

1029
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:04,819
or the explosion there's no other
courses

1030
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:08,229
onto this pretty briefly and let usable
lay the foundation for what we didn't

1031
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,839
talk about

1032
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:10,829
here we've got

1033
00:44:10,829 --> 00:44:12,469
an experimenter

1034
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:14,139
and a child

1035
00:44:14,139 --> 00:44:15,479
fall and there's this

1036
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:16,500
pop it here

1037
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,729
okay this bit of this bear

1038
00:44:18,729 --> 00:44:20,110
and the experimental

1039
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,130
takes a puppet

1040
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:24,130
and makes a puppet tried on ball

1041
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:28,129
all in the stalled middle compare
quicklinks

1042
00:44:28,129 --> 00:44:32,139
then after the boots for my child of
done this

1043
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:33,979
all of them

1044
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:36,079
barest put away in a cabinet

1045
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,990
and the experimenter turns to the child
and say

1046
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,450
let's move the ball

1047
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,679
our called

1048
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:45,550
or container into this box

1049
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,160
okay so that they do that

1050
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,370
and then they go get

1051
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:49,680
the puppet again

1052
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,009
and then say

1053
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:53,200
the bear once the final hall

1054
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,369
where do you think the bear will work

1055
00:44:56,369 --> 00:44:59,410
and the part of what happens is

1056
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,999
three-year-olds

1057
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:02,140
four-year-olds will say

1058
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:07,129
the bear is going to look in the box

1059
00:45:07,129 --> 00:45:08,239
okay

1060
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,459
and u_s_ to build us a child why the
bear is going to look at the box

1061
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,439
even though the bear

1062
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:15,650
the ball into the old mill container

1063
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:17,949
and the child will say some words to the
effect of

1064
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,839
'cause that's where it is

1065
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,229
the three-year-old

1066
00:45:21,229 --> 00:45:22,170
seems to think

1067
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,609
that the bearer who knows what you know

1068
00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:28,299
who has the same

1069
00:45:28,299 --> 00:45:28,770
five-year-olds

1070
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:32,469
and some four-year-olds when they're
asked that question will say

1071
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:35,989
the bearable look in the old mill
container

1072
00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:37,769
and when it passed one

1073
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:40,000
they'll say words to the effect of

1074
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,829
because that's where the bear thinks it
is

1075
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:45,400
they had this idea

1076
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,490
that the barrett has ideas and thoughts

1077
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:49,470
that are different

1078
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:50,870
from the child's

1079
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,950
knowledge and believes and his lawyers
and that is

1080
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,869
the criterion

1081
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:57,069
padding a theory of mine

1082
00:45:57,069 --> 00:45:59,239
that is having an idea

1083
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:02,819
of one mental states as representations
about

1084
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:06,489
differ from one individual to

1085
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:07,529
august just movement

1086
00:46:07,529 --> 00:46:10,219
those of you who are all bible readers

1087
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:12,509
or or organs and

1088
00:46:12,509 --> 00:46:13,669
even as literature

1089
00:46:13,669 --> 00:46:17,259
the story of jacob these lawyers i think
the earliest

1090
00:46:17,259 --> 00:46:18,670
form or

1091
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:21,910
hong broke representation or before
school the past

1092
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:25,269
it's essentially a saint asked

1093
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:27,719
elect read if you look at all

1094
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:30,410
but here's work all by henry wellman

1095
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:33,169
tracing the development of the theory of
mind

1096
00:46:33,169 --> 00:46:37,579
whether skids past forced most of the
forcefully expressed or not

1097
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:38,180
alms

1098
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,080
from oslo

1099
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,939
age two and a half

1100
00:46:40,939 --> 00:46:43,509
most don't

1101
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,569
too

1102
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,359
age seven or so

1103
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,819
almost everybody does and what you see
here is there's this period

1104
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:53,689
where the child is

1105
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:54,430
four

1106
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:56,229
five years of age

1107
00:46:56,229 --> 00:46:59,919
where the majority of children and i'll
pass in the polls weakness

1108
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:01,099
that had the idea that

1109
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:02,849
there you know something

1110
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:05,469
let somebody else does not know

1111
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:10,150
had not everybody has the same part of
the the same knowledge in tomorrow

1112
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,800
and you can think about that

1113
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,309
as a criterion

1114
00:47:13,309 --> 00:47:14,439
for hall

1115
00:47:14,439 --> 00:47:16,849
for consciousness

1116
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:22,129
are in fact simon baron cohen sasha
baron colin's

1117
00:47:22,129 --> 00:47:23,349
form

1118
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:24,629
had suggested

1119
00:47:24,629 --> 00:47:27,179
that this fellow that that the false
belief task

1120
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:29,609
is kind of the epitome of the
development

1121
00:47:29,609 --> 00:47:30,229
orble

1122
00:47:30,229 --> 00:47:32,390
of the morning you suggested that

1123
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:36,719
when you've got a theory of the morning
you're able to engage in what he calls

1124
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:38,959
minded really

1125
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,289
understanding

1126
00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:41,179
the police

1127
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:44,200
the feelings and the desires volvo

1128
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,569
of another person

1129
00:47:45,569 --> 00:47:48,249
and he suggested there someone with a
whole bunch of elements

1130
00:47:48,249 --> 00:47:51,789
uh... here that were not we don't have
to talk about

1131
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:53,809
the one that develops

1132
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:55,009
last

1133
00:47:55,009 --> 00:47:56,809
theory of mind mechanism

1134
00:47:56,809 --> 00:48:03,189
the ability to impugn states of mind to
other people based on their behavior

1135
00:48:03,189 --> 00:48:07,229
knowledge recognition that other people
have

1136
00:48:07,229 --> 00:48:10,889
feelings and his lawyers just as we do
that they are thoughts feelings and

1137
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,889
desires

1138
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,109
well from ours

1139
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:18,489
and baron cohen is carbon has suggested
that need to these elements all the

1140
00:48:18,489 --> 00:48:20,140
theory of mind

1141
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:25,900
is mediated by the uh... cognitive
module that has been associated

1142
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,469
brain module to it

1143
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:33,890
where my dad brain module beat

1144
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:38,709
taxicab wisher given adult tomorrow i
study in which they red subjects stories

1145
00:48:38,709 --> 00:48:42,489
while they were in the scatter some of
which were stories about true and false

1146
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:45,390
police just like the false police task

1147
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,339
orders just about mechanical inferences

1148
00:48:48,339 --> 00:48:52,979
and others just about human action but
not about police as such

1149
00:48:52,979 --> 00:48:56,939
and tried to identify and area of the
brain

1150
00:48:56,939 --> 00:49:01,229
was activated specifically when people
were trying to understand stories about

1151
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,190
true and false beliefs

1152
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,699
and they found it

1153
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:09,299
here at the junction albee

1154
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:12,219
and the parietal lobes doug briefly back
up okay
