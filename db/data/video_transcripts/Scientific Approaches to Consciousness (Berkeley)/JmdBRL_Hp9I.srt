1
00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:06,319
okay let's take up a couple in new
topics this week

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,299
last week

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,779
introduced a couple of

4
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:12,899
altered states of consciousness that
seem to be induced

5
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:16,839
psychologically that is by virtue of
suggestions or ideas or whatever

6
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:20,899
as opposed to being induced
physiologically by the administration of

7
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:23,079
one or another kind of uh...

8
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,149
controlled

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,539
one of continued that theme today

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:30,150
by talking about a bunch of states that
are related to

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,530
ships in the deployment of attention

12
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,920
as i indicated at the very beginning of
the class one of the

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,380
easiest ways fifteen percent colleges to
think about

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,790
consciousness this difficult out
consciousness in terms of attention

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,540
we've become conscious of something by
paying attention to it

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,139
when we pay attention to something

17
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:53,760
we become conscious while that if we're
not conscious of something we're engaged

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,940
in pre conscious or pre attentive
processing

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,560
equation

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,210
between consciousness and attention is
something the runs

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,110
very all strongly through

22
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,350
the entire a scientific literature

23
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,050
on unconsciousness

24
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,180
so what i want to talk about this week

25
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,679
are some states of altered consciousness
that seem to be that seem to come about

26
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:18,770
by virtue of one or another

27
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,650
or alteration unlocking the deployment
of attention

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,720
today i'm going to talk about a number
of everyday states

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,380
that is

30
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,479
states that are encountered it in the
ordinary course of everyday living

31
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,970
everyone of us in this room

32
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,300
experienced these kinds of states

33
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,230
also lists more than others

34
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,120
some of us right now

35
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,540
and then on wednesday i will talk about

36
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,510
and i don't like the term but had to
have some contrast between everyday with

37
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,449
with everyday what you might call exotic

38
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:55,979
states of consciousness their associated
with various meditative

39
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,390
traditions and uh... and disciplines

40
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,610
our scientific work

41
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,880
that has its origins in the home

42
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,580
he hugged eastern

43
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,890
or the religions

44
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,200
or hinduism

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,619
giving rise to the practice of yoga and
buddhism giving rise to the practice

46
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,469
exam

47
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:14,469
farm or not there yet

48
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,139
first let's talk about some of these
everyday states states that ordinary

49
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,189
people in the ordinary course of
everyday living

50
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:22,230
all have experienced

51
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,739
uh... from time to time

52
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:29,979
one of these has been most of commonly
study does the state known as absorption

53
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:34,229
all work doesn't work mostly by alcatel
again a psychologist at the university

54
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:35,370
of of uh...

55
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,779
of minnesota

56
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:38,879
who gave

57
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,180
absorption

58
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,499
kula state that the has a kind of weird
definition

59
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:48,299
cognitive restructuring of self and ego
boundaries by which he means you

60
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,139
perceive yourself you proceed

61
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,039
the distinction between yourself and
other raj x

62
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,529
that's what it needs or boundary is that
barrier

63
00:02:57,529 --> 00:02:59,830
difference between me and u

64
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,019
or between you

65
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,939
and the rest of us

66
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,739
which takes place in a all under
circumstances a very narrowly focused

67
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,049
attention

68
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,029
on you've kind of

69
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:13,579
taken a spotlight and honed in on just
one aspect

70
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:16,919
all of the stimulus uh... obstacles
warming

71
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,300
and leading to

72
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,939
some kind of a departure from everyday
modes of thought

73
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,809
uh... that was

74
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:26,489
they didn't have to be there i'd suppose

75
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,639
all but uh... all adobe what what
elegant tried to do is to develop a

76
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,390
questionnaire

77
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,349
known as the absorption scale or the
telegram absorption scale

78
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,520
which would kind of which would assess

79
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,169
the degree to which people had these
kinds of experiences

80
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:45,269
in the ordinary course of everyday
living and he just sat down with one of

81
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,010
his evolved into graduate students
covert at consent

82
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,079
and they just had a party writing items
all dog the dog tried to goad trying to

83
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,449
capture these kinds of experiences

84
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,359
also

85
00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:00,179
this is kind of a informal content
analysis will give you a better

86
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:02,989
idea of the contents of the scale off in
a moment

87
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,539
if you want to take the absorption skill
for yourself if you haven't done it

88
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:07,509
already

89
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,869
if you go to the lecture supplements

90
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:11,700
click on absorption

91
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,139
and just scroll down a little bit you'll
find a link to the absorption scale

92
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,910
on which you can print out in

93
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,609
fill in for yourself

94
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:21,780
all that and then there's another link

95
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,030
to page that'll tell you how to score it
and find out whether your high remedial

96
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,690
more loyal

97
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,370
in absorption

98
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,389
based on the normative all-new

99
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:35,919
for the study of the absorption scale

100
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,870
on telugu and all the discovered

101
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,600
that the thirty four items of the
absorption scale

102
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,689
all kind of

103
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:47,130
while parceled themselves out into six
major factors

104
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,920
fine you can see with these novel or
likable right here

105
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,229
responsiveness to engage in stimuli

106
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:55,190
that is something really kind of

107
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,319
picks you up then

108
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,830
puts you in a different place all like
you can be deeply moved by us on the set

109
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,610
some of us would go off and we look at
the songs that we all serve all the ads

110
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,449
could be dark soon

111
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:06,530
home

112
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,110
and uh...

113
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,930
and other people just get fascinated by
the sunset of the changes of color of

114
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,990
the song and what what it does to the
clouds and

115
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,809
and all that kind of business use kept
kind of got wrapped up in it

116
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:21,169
and there are lots of items on the
absorption scale like this

117
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:25,459
cause that has to do with being absorbed
in this sense three are sensory

118
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,330
experience

119
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,490
painting

120
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,289
callers

121
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:30,759
almost anything

122
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,270
all

123
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,600
so just the usual is another common
aspect of absorption where there's a

124
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,000
kind of a what's known as a cross modal
experience you have

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,069
visual experiences that are stimulated
by auditory stimuli

126
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:46,110
or you have all

127
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,929
all factory experiences that are
stimulated by visual stimuli or whatever

128
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:52,940
here's our kind of

129
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:58,129
that an example of this soul music
reminds me of pictures or changing color

130
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:58,770
patterns

131
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,159
and of course musics of auditory
stimulus a doesn't have any changing

132
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:04,099
color patterns that at all

133
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:06,330
all of the most serious in his speech

134
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,190
paula alexander screen album

135
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,199
the great russian romantic

136
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,449
neil romantic composer

137
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,220
was himself this in a state

138
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,969
he had the idea that problem

139
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:18,779
that uh... different pitches

140
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:23,240
on the scale were associated with
different colors and in fact he invented

141
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,839
of color oregon

142
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,250
which when you press the key would play
a c

143
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,449
but i would also flawed although show
radio

144
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:32,090
radio

145
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,270
know that uh... a swatch of the color
that per screen arbonne

146
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,060
was associated with each of these things

147
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,929
most people don't have that experience
but some people do

148
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:44,229
scrabb inhabited spades

149
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,639
all third factor enhance cognition

150
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,610
aiken somehow sense the president's

151
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,580
of another person before i actually see
or hear

152
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,830
on him or her

153
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,309
all bball had that kind of experience at
that one time or another you've got your

154
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:58,180
back to the door

155
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,199
nobody's said hello yet but all the
sudden it kind of sense that there's

156
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,349
somebody there

157
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:05,319
all some people have that allot more
than others

158
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,740
but it generally this enhance cognition
factor has to do

159
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,590
now what whether cognition is really
enhanced

160
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,699
like you get twenty extra points on your
right to test or something like that

161
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:17,730
but rather it's the experience

162
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,419
of enhanced cognition

163
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,199
the feeling or the belief

164
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,980
that you're seeing things that you that
in a way that you didn't see them before

165
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,150
that you also somehow

166
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,509
are having experiences that are
different from other people

167
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:31,990
on here's another one

168
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,979
oblivious mysore what all of the pelican
calls dissociated involvement

169
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:38,710
when watching a movie i may become so
involved

170
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,430
but i forget all about myself and my
surrounding in and experienced movie

171
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,629
physical real when i was taking part in
it

172
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:49,580
it's a disposed of experience because
your routine awareness of your immediate

173
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,830
surroundings

174
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,300
while you're engaged in this so-called
in this sort of the in this activity

175
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,389
lot of people have the support of the
kind of experience

176
00:07:58,389 --> 00:07:59,529
alone when they're

177
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:01,279
what where they re gauged with media

178
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,960
the scale the absorption scare was
written in nineteen seventy four

179
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,139
i think the only video game around at
that point was pacman

180
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,810
alms and all of these days you can just
imagine

181
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,110
that there are people who get wrapped up
in video games of various kinds

182
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,090
hard on the plane on for hours and hours
and hours on end

183
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,120
nobody in this room of course

184
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,800
small blood

185
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,650
it can happen

186
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,660
then vivid reminiscences

187
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,180
sometimes i feel experience things as i
did when i was a child

188
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,240
kind of regressive experience where

189
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,760
your your past comes flooding back to
you

190
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,650
all in various ways and then finally
enhanced awareness things the might seem

191
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,130
meaningless to others

192
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,010
often makes sense to me

193
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,419
again

194
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,090
this idea that somehow your cognition
has been

195
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,310
uh... has been altered

196
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,650
uh... you know in various ways

197
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:55,410
we now know based on various kinds of
psychometric studies

198
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,970
absorption as a trade a personality that
is is that characteristic weight that

199
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,619
some people are pink

200
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,320
that's different

201
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,010
quantitatively from the way other people
kind of thing has its place in what's

202
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,320
known as the big five structural
personality

203
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,810
for those of you who have taken a
personality course or maybe some

204
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,880
versions of

205
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,540
of intro you know the personalities
psychologists have now taken all the dot

206
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,960
down now argue with her

207
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,890
thanks we come to a consensus

208
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,880
that the major individual differences in
personality can be summarized

209
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,090
five principal dimensions

210
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,390
barrada schism extra version agreeable
miss conscientious

211
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,040
and what's called openness to experience

212
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,870
murata schism is just what it sounds
like a high degrees of anxiety worry

213
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,980
depression all sorts of other kind of
dysphoric or experiences

214
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,010
extra version has to do with the
outgoing an adventuresome

215
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,190
agreeable this has to do with being a
nice person

216
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,970
on conscientious this has to do with the
reliable

217
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,480
and openness has to do with

218
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,880
opened its that has to be other ed has
to do with a person's

219
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,610
willingness to entertain new fox
willingness to try new things

220
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,720
willingness to have various kinds of
experiences

221
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,670
and on something like the any you know
eroticism extra virgin openness

222
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:18,480
all of the n_ deal personality of a jury
which is the standard

223
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,710
instrument for off for measuring the use
of the these traits

224
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:26,310
openness to experience is measured in
terms of six different facets

225
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,560
what many of which

226
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,540
look like the kinds of items that are on
the absorption scale your richness of

227
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,080
your fantasy life you have the same old
tennessee wilbur and over and over again

228
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,139
the same way

229
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:39,279
or do you have these really great
fantasies where they're at the

230
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,390
characters change of the times change
and all of that

231
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,220
aesthetic sensitivity

232
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,329
pretty but pretty self-explanatory

233
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,949
awareness a bitter feelings or u_n_
touch with your with uh... with uh...

234
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,170
with your interior wife

235
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,430
alm people who are audience openers have
all

236
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,320
seem to have a need for a high degrees
of variety and actions

237
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,990
they're very curious

238
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,840
on intellectually that want to know
about lots of things whether it's

239
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,260
old quantum mechanics or just collier

240
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,750
tv remote works

241
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,639
and also interestingly

242
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,050
on these individuals tend to have a
liberal value systems

243
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,910
which doesn't mean that they always vote
democratic or something like that

244
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,620
on what it means is that you need to
spend that kind of be hauled to have

245
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,309
more of all live about live attitude on
towards uh...

246
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:31,150
towards other people and uh... and other
ideas

247
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,570
although absorption

248
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,920
dont takes its place in the big five
structure personality

249
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,020
by virtue of its oil

250
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,920
of its relationship to this

251
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,650
fifth dimension

252
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,430
this dimension global of openness

253
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,040
here's a little study for my laboratory
long ago

254
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,319
in which we looked at the correlation
between absorption and hypnotize ability

255
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:55,439
telegram was actually hypnosis
researcher although you know the low but

256
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:58,720
it wasn't uh... developing personality
questionnaires

257
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,820
and donald

258
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,510
he'd old the original idea behind the
absorption questionnaire

259
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,840
was a one thing we know is that people
who are highly responsive to hip

260
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,470
youngsters are also prone to have

261
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,019
hypnotic like experiences

262
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:13,440
outside

263
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,070
we have not a context

264
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,270
they tend to get

265
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,920
their leaders states for their
attentions

266
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,340
focused on one thing to the exclusion of
other things on

267
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,120
imaginative experiences to become real
for them

268
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,740
and art elegant was actually trying to
write our personality questionnaire

269
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,330
paper and pencil questionnaire

270
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:35,009
that would help predict people's alone
um... level of hypnotized only

271
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:36,060
and it does

272
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,389
kind up stored up

273
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,310
that's a significant correlation

274
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,820
but it's not the kind of correlation
that allows you to predict in advance

275
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,370
whether somebody's going to be kept the
price of oil or not

276
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,320
the only way to find out whether
somebody's hypnotize ipl

277
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,819
is to try to get no's'

278
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,580
and c at about that it works

279
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,370
scores on the telus absorption scale
correlate

280
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,060
high teens low twenty's

281
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,190
with hypnotize ability

282
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,400
and so do scales all although openness

283
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,890
but it turns out there is some big
differences

284
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:10,030
there are these three facets of openness
fantasy of fantasy is statics and

285
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,700
feelings

286
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,800
that are

287
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,010
reasonably modestly correlated with the
advisability but there are other facets

288
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:23,090
of it all go out on both of those palm
all floodwall

289
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:27,650
on me for a variety of actions on
openness to other ideas and liberal

290
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,069
valuable

291
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:31,309
they're not related to the prize ability
uh...

292
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:32,830
really very much at all

293
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,920
which suggests

294
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,970
that in fact

295
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,990
there are two

296
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:41,000
different waives all be open again this
is work for my laboratory

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,509
we distinguish between

298
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:46,829
on three different kinds of openness won
the recall absorption which is all about

299
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:47,700
absorption

300
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,660
and this fantasy anesthetic sensitivity
and feelings facets

301
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,060
or or both of us would for instance if
measured

302
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,480
uh... traditionally

303
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,160
and then there is so see a political
liberalism

304
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,020
and there is what you might call
intellect ins

305
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,149
intellect in this is an old termined
personality psychology

306
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:05,800
and it has to do with

307
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,950
appearing this march

308
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,010
being smart

309
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,790
just looking smart

310
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,739
and the hall of the holdout uh...
getting other people the impression

311
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:18,340
that you're smart

312
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,450
ald

313
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,160
these absorption

314
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,850
socio political liberalism and intellect
ads are all part of this open this

315
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,729
package but they're really quite
different kinds of things

316
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:30,930
an absorption is really all the
correlated with the hubble

317
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,500
windfall fantasy ascetic sensitivity

318
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,010
and uh... and feelings

319
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,780
mean you can be a right wing person and
still be hired absorption you can be not

320
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,759
all that curious and still be absorbed
by

321
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,110
what it is that you're curious about

322
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,230
palm and uh... and so on

323
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,570
now absorption is often measured by this
absorption questionnaire that's how we

324
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,209
do it but at the pinnacle isn't whether
context as well

325
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:01,310
and this is the kind of experience for
all of you of or at least many of you or

326
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:01,970
will

327
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,990
the love had

328
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,840
this is work buyer i'm sure

329
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,020
on wave run short of the university of
new hampshire

330
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,790
on what he called the book reading
fantasy

331
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,369
and shore observed

332
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:16,029
that's fun people when they were a
dangerous read for the content of the

333
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:18,899
book you know and they could re warren
peace or something like that they could

334
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,480
tell you

335
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,160
it's about war

336
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,420
it's about russia

337
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,510
uh... which is what tolstoy said it was
about

338
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,679
palm uh...

339
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,889
or they will really get wrapped up in
their reading their turning pages madly

340
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,869
trying to get to the end of the chapter

341
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:37,350
they don't stop at the end of the
chapter that go onto the next tractor

342
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:42,700
pretty soon they've lost the whole day
the book is overall band and all that

343
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,830
wonderful experience when you have it

344
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,610
all

345
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,199
on and also these are people get deeply
involved in the imaginative experiences

346
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,380
stimulated by the book

347
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,139
so that what they're reading in the book

348
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:00,409
becomes real to them as realistic they
were actually have been the of the um...

349
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:02,900
know that uh... the experience itself

350
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,860
paul

351
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,970
jason boren's being chased down the
streets of paris and you feel like

352
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,310
you're jason bourne being chased down

353
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,760
on the streets of paris

354
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,200
the fantasy elicited by the book reading
the active book reading is very

355
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,610
compelling

356
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,210
visual experiences you are not just
reading words on the page

357
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:24,170
all you have a novel all sorts of the
old experiences and caller in three

358
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,650
dimensions in europe

359
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,980
smelling things that we're hearing
things that all of that

360
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,560
all at the same time

361
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,890
all going to be you get so involved in
the book

362
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:37,810
that you've become oblivious to what's
going on outside your roommate may come

363
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,620
in and star rummaging through

364
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,209
on spirit or per day

365
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,380
para socks or

366
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,610
letter yet rummaging through your bureau
drawer for a pair of socks

367
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,639
already just don't

368
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,010
pick up on this on at all

369
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:50,920
alm

370
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,789
moreover

371
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:52,569
people are

372
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,420
within the book reading fantasy

373
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,490
people already aware that they are
actively constructing this experience

374
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,879
for themselves aren't so i'm reading all
of the board identity and i'm going up

375
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,220
that never pretend i'm jason bourne
running down the streets of paris

376
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,220
they just do it

377
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,329
happens to them

378
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,110
on you get wrapped up in this thing

379
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,449
now that doesn't mean that

380
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,710
you know when the fire alarm goes off
they're not going to respond they do

381
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,750
though they might respond kind of slowly
like a little

382
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,079
what's going on

383
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,020
that's the kind of bog of of experience

384
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,700
that is really kind of captures

385
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,920
the essential phenomenology

386
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,520
of these absorption states that poem

387
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,650
that uh...

388
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,890
how it was trying to we're trying to
talk about and this is an experience a

389
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,059
lots of people have i dare say everybody
in this room has had this experience one

390
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,050
time or another

391
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,740
but unfortunately it's one that's not
been studied very much

392
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,860
and equally unfortunately it's one
that's not been studied very much by

393
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,419
i'll buy you know uh...

394
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:57,880
investigators

395
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,310
who study reedy

396
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,940
they're interested how people decode
words and how they understand text and

397
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,800
all of that

398
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,350
but there's been a very very little

399
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,710
uh... attention given

400
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,220
the subjective experience of reading

401
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,299
all and to

402
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,790
i'll be you know that the way in which
people get involved

403
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,690
all one person whose job it was a bit

404
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,100
counter example of this is

405
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,930
rabbi arabic turn alle south african
psychologist

406
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,940
who has actually argued

407
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,840
that certain forms of reading

408
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,110
what he calls the utica reading

409
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,840
playful

410
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,760
reading

411
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,900
archived and can it can actually involve
consciousness changes of various of our

412
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,460
times

413
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,550
and his wrote written wonderful book
called lost in a book

414
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,190
hog in which you details on these up

415
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,419
these experiences

416
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:48,580
where people are reading for pleasure

417
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,119
alva and they become absorbed in what
they're reading

418
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,889
and what they're reading creates a
subjective world for the person

419
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:56,330
that he or she law

420
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,500
that she uh... that he or she enters

421
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,250
and again

422
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,480
the idea here is

423
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,940
that'd liu dick reading playful reading

424
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,750
the reader becomes very very very
absorbed

425
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,250
and what's going on

426
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,840
what's going on

427
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,440
bulb

428
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,540
and bill

429
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,700
uh... it's it's not a

430
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,870
cycler criteria but one way to identify
buddha graders is to find people who

431
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,870
read a lot

432
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,590
especially real lot of fiction

433
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,520
it's very hard to do would agree dude
with an intro psych textbook

434
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,600
long photo

435
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,650
a little bit readers all the time to
read

436
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,010
very very very along

437
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,280
abundantly

438
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,950
you know a book a week uh...

439
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,960
now just because you read a book weight
doesn't mean you're alluded reader

440
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,230
book reviewers for newspapers and
magazines read a book a weak some of the

441
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,090
read a book and a

442
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,259
but they're reading for work they're not
reading for play

443
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:53,559
they're not getting absorbed necessarily
getting absorbed in the book

444
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,740
they're trying to figure out

445
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,780
what the books but what the book sold
out

446
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,249
so they can report on it

447
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:01,480
to their own readers

448
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,520
and you don't all of the josephine hell
guard delay josephine bogard on at

449
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,060
stanford

450
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,980
although also did some work on this and
suggested that there were uh... black

451
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,040
shoes several different types of what
schorr called the book reading fantasy

452
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,379
one where you are going to fight with
the characters

453
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:18,550
in the story

454
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,430
the other one where you don't know that
if i with the characters you don't think

455
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,180
you're scarlett o'hara something like
that

456
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,820
all but you are identified with the

457
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,090
with the emotions

458
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,920
that are being boldly presented

459
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,350
and dog and a very nice set of loan kind
of sending clinical studies

460
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,260
on hill guard who was both a
psychologist and a psychiatrist

461
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,950
home

462
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,710
who tried to identify some of the
characters characteristics of these

463
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,040
involved or breeders

464
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,279
and she made the point

465
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,519
that involved readers really have to
actively get into the reading

466
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,929
they don't they don't just get swept
away automatically

467
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:54,730
by reading

468
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,110
uh... it's it's it's kind of it
intentional activity

469
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,050
that takes on of life or a life of its
own

470
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:02,870
though

471
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,889
why canal

472
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,120
she pointed out

473
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,299
that this kind of

474
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:10,280
book reading fantasy is very time
limited

475
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,750
sometimes of the tube very often see

476
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,250
all of them people put in a book down
you know but they're very involved in at

477
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,200
the beverly come to a logical stopping
point that could put the book from side

478
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,910
and turn it unturned their attention of
whether tasks

479
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:29,080
if u bombs are ever watched a parent to
read a book to a child

480
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,970
you will often see this kind of thing
happening

481
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,650
where boat

482
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,500
the the proverbial redo the child in bed
at night

483
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,940
and the you'd be doing a chapter book
annulled get involved in the book to be

484
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,649
reading although all the way through

485
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:42,999
get to the end of a chapter

486
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:44,830
and then the parent says

487
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,309
okay that's the end of the chapter time
to turn out the lightened go to bed

488
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,600
on what that does is interestingly

489
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,000
that gives the child practicing going
into this state involvement and then

490
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,230
coming back out of it and then going
back to do it the next day and coming

491
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,580
back out of it

492
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,400
on that kind of experience

493
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,960
lays the foundation for a very very
active

494
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,250
imaginative involvements

495
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:12,370
all later in new york unit in the
child's life it's very good alum

496
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,110
very good people

497
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,610
child-rearing experience

498
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,760
here's another place where you can see
absorption

499
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,850
the so-called

500
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,410
method acting

501
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,990
on has logged on made famous by the
great russian of the theater director

502
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,520
constantine stanislawski

503
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,050
i will read this quote to you except a
highlight absorption

504
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,630
are the actors completely absorbed by
some profoundly moving objective so deep

505
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,700
rose is holding passionately into are

506
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,740
into effect into its execution

507
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,269
fallen

508
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:45,710
when a good example of method acting

509
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,520
got watch any marlon brando movie
especially it really marlon brando

510
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,720
movies streetcar named desire

511
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,780
on the waterfront something like that

512
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,690
brando was trained in this method

513
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,740
uh...

514
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,050
dot he was probly america's foremost

515
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,530
them

516
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,790
practitioner

517
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,550
okay and then returning to hell guard
for a second hilbert pointed simply

518
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,730
pointed out that there are lots of other
places ways in which people can be

519
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,750
actively involved in a magic of
experiences

520
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,870
totally absorbed

521
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,230
in these kinds of

522
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,380
non radical imagine experiences not just
reading but also draw baat

523
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,559
alone she made a distinction between
method acting and technical acting

524
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,650
difference between

525
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,440
marlon brando and dustin hoffman for
example

526
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,880
hoffman's a great actor actor but he's
not a method actor he's a technical

527
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,490
actor he knows how to turn the stuff on
and off

528
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,130
all

529
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,630
getting involved in various kinds of
sensory stimulation

530
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:49,240
all people get wrapped up in the sun
sets or bolna ranges or snow for or

531
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,480
whatever org

532
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,680
and basically

533
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,309
what the hell guard pointed out was that
there are these people

534
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,590
will get highly absorbent whatever it is
they're doing

535
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,540
and engage in what she called

536
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,879
by their mental

537
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:04,680
or hall or physical

538
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,230
physical space travel

539
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:11,850
one last speech or alba sorption that
gets a lot of attention these days

540
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,450
though not as much research as it does
talked

541
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,010
it is possible

542
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,410
is flow

543
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,760
this is work by argue carly chicks and
maja aali

544
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,670
that's how you pronounce that

545
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,640
all of the made what

546
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,150
for teachers

547
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:31,940
enormously more complicated by
publishing with his wife

548
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,520
right i got to say that word twice

549
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,700
arctic semi

550
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,730
okay odds vaguely variant

551
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,990
section is pretty

552
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,580
clearly area

553
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,510
alm and i think though that has been dug
up a lot of the paid a lot of attention

554
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,390
to a state that he calls

555
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,019
flow

556
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,960
a state in which people are so involved
in an activity that nothing else seems

557
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,060
to matter

558
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,809
where the experience itself was
enjoyable

559
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:59,090
people actually paid to do with the to
engage in this

560
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,830
or do it just for their shoes

561
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,799
just for sheer pleasure

562
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,080
of it

563
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,910
flow is that there is an experience a
gets a lot of attention these days

564
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,570
from so-called positive psychologists

565
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,179
we're always looking for people who are
that kind of get into the

566
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,960
flow of things

567
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,470
altered some of my has not

568
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,159
in of particularly

569
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:19,779
uh...

570
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:22,640
uh... active in trying to relate

571
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,720
flow to

572
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,529
cognitive psychology of attention

573
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:28,809
but it's very clear from his
descriptions

574
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:30,720
that what he means by

575
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,410
this is same

576
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,570
experience of

577
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,540
focused attention all of them complete
involvement in a task

578
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,080
to be exclusion

579
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,200
global oval

580
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,050
of everything else

581
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,770
alm

582
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,020
oh so here we go

583
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,630
focused in ordered stuff dot focused on
ordered state of conscious also and

584
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,610
focused on this end this is our number
one priority

585
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,970
all from my mind

586
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,380
fault the checks at mile high suggested
that

587
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,820
floor workers

588
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,950
all went to task calm

589
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:05,040
is all good didn't dissolve

590
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,460
appropriate

591
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,019
to whatever a person could do you can't
get into the

592
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:13,160
flow of the task if you find it really
difficult

593
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,840
by the same token he argues that you
can't really get it get into a test to

594
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,720
get find it too easy either

595
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,909
that there there is some kind of

596
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:23,549
optimum point there

597
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:27,520
that that balances the ease of
difficulty

598
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,470
or where for flow is more likely to
happen

599
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,850
so the argument would be

600
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,650
you might be able

601
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,889
how boat experience of

602
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:38,400
flow if you're a pretty good tetris
player

603
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,520
but maybe no matter how good you worried
checkers it's just not going to happen

604
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,730
although i'd known people who can really
get involved in checkers

605
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,549
really amazing

606
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:53,220
amazing experience

607
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,029
and the contents of conta consciousness
or conger with your goals

608
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:58,880
your goal is to play the game

609
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,139
your goal is to play the instrument or
to improvise or or whatever and you're

610
00:27:03,139 --> 00:27:05,530
not thinking about other things and i
think it about

611
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:09,080
uh... hungry or how tired you are or off

612
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,180
what you have to do tomorrow

613
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,059
palm

614
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:12,790
and

615
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:15,450
again the idea here is that

616
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,850
what you what i want to called mental
energy or cognitive capacity or whatever

617
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,649
seems to

618
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:21,529
flow

619
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:23,570
that's where the experts can't sustain

620
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,669
effortlessly

621
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:27,490
whether it's truly effortless or not

622
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,059
is another matter

623
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:29,700
okay

624
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,099
in fact if you're focusing all your
attention on the task is probably not

625
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:34,539
effortless

626
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:39,730
in terms of not consuming cognitive
capacity but it's experienced as

627
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,220
effortless the consciousness

628
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:47,000
you don't have this awareness that
you're working uh... very hard

629
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,760
palm

630
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,740
and again

631
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,360
on the up the heart of the check some of
my argues that law

632
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,879
if you think about something else you
just can't get into the

633
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:59,340
flow of this activity you've got to be
able to devote forward your cognitive

634
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,960
resources

635
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,520
we saw on this thing

636
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,620
gypsum are high was himself a student to
all day perhaps man slow one of the

637
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:13,380
great paul dot the forerunners of the
modern positive all of the psychology of

638
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:13,830
movement

639
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,929
and in fact the cardiology concept of
flow

640
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:21,480
all comes out of matters most concept of
a preacher experience

641
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,790
again many of you had uh... introductory
psychology course

642
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:29,090
know that matt slow postulated a
hierarchy

643
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,000
motives

644
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,490
physiological needs like longer in first
down at the bottom

645
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,040
safety needs

646
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,919
home

647
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:39,850
warning this needs the need for other
people that fr

648
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,700
nism lovers and all of that

649
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,330
the steam needs up here at the idea that
you're competent in perceive yourself as

650
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,559
competent and

651
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,059
loans of the need to be perceived as
confident

652
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:52,470
and then ballclub appalled

653
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,960
basil argued that once again all those
needs met

654
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,470
and not until you get all those needs
met then you've got these distinctly

655
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,550
human on needs the argued

656
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,210
on what he called self actual is a
stands

657
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,990
for which he

658
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,960
kind of captured in those kind of uh...
oh

659
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,489
rock dramatic language

660
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:17,669
all whiteness richness that need for
truth and need for

661
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:20,789
of those for book for playfulness and
our

662
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:23,210
and for all the proper wholeness

663
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,450
and firm are slow

664
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:29,070
the attainment of all of these self
actual is a sudanese was marked by what

665
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,220
he called a peak experience

666
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,889
the experience or the object tends to be
seen as a whole

667
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:37,610
of complete unit

668
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,090
on detached from everything else

669
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,040
detached from possible usefulness uh...
and all of that

670
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,830
of the percept that's fully intended to
your absorbent at it's yugo transcending

671
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,340
you kind of

672
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:51,889
dissolve

673
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:53,989
the boundary between of

674
00:29:53,989 --> 00:29:55,029
between self

675
00:29:55,029 --> 00:30:00,659
and other on he become disoriented in
time and space on and there is kind of a

676
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:01,889
unity unconsciousness

677
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:03,409
by which maz lament

678
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:05,450
you perceive yourself as one

679
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,790
at the world

680
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,309
that's not easy to do

681
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:13,140
okay giving these cheap thud experiences

682
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,989
but matt slow argued that

683
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:16,539
what that

684
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:16,919
cheating

685
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,880
these kinds of people experience is

686
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,639
was a uh... was goal that we all had

687
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:27,680
but again there was a gold at all they
could be bad with the more blood being

688
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,880
safety and uh... and all that ten b

689
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,480
than the intended

690
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,130
how would you know what he had one or
not

691
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,640
basil had no idea

692
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,860
all public trying to do is to on id info
on the studies

693
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,710
was to try to thought that get an
assessment

694
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,400
of whether people in that it had never
had this or not

695
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,870
and he would simply ask people this
question

696
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,029
i'd like you to think of the most
wonderful experience or experiences in

697
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:53,930
your life

698
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:57,400
the happiest moments moments of ecstasy

699
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,640
rapture

700
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,030
algunas the maybe be in the world but
not

701
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,500
just being in long beach

702
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,050
qualms or been something hit by a book
or a painting or whatever

703
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,470
what he did was he asked people list
these

704
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,820
most people

705
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,880
relatively short list

706
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,919
and then on he tried to just get them to
describe

707
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,620
what that what that experience

708
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,990
old was like

709
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,030
and what he did what when he did that

710
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,220
he got

711
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,840
all reports that he characterized as
follows

712
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,509
in some reports the whole of the world
is seen as a unity

713
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:32,559
as a single rich white bent to the

714
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,430
so there's no baba re between self and
others

715
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:41,310
there's no separation between one object
in the environment and the other

716
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,570
called yet have to have been there

717
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,330
i guess uh... is part of the point here

718
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:47,760
alm

719
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,500
in other pic experiences

720
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,440
one small part of the world as if it
were for the moment all of the world

721
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,940
on so we get that goes on and talks
about the the cognitions that kinds of

722
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,510
perception experience is that

723
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,390
that occur

724
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:07,530
occurred during self actual inflation

725
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,810
that these are all various

726
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,600
facets of all the portion

727
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,850
this absurd that this the state

728
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,340
we're your attention is focused on

729
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,279
one thing

730
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,679
to the exclusion of everything else

731
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,200
that one thing

732
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,360
fills your consciousness fills your
awareness

733
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,840
and for called

734
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,929
for all of that had at least for the
time when you're absorbed

735
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:30,210
that's all you know

736
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,760
that's all you're experiencing

737
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,919
the rest of the world

738
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,220
is kind of

739
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,090
now let's look at the other side

740
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:40,880
for a moment

741
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,899
where your attention drifts off

742
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:45,200
from watcher supposed to be doing

743
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,770
you're not paying attention to the
things that are supposed to be of the

744
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,370
run right in front of you

745
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:55,980
budge or all of the book but uh... but
is the moved elsewhere

746
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,350
which we called a drink

747
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,329
all which is also gotten some study but
not

748
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:03,470
nearly a swatch into maisie medals

749
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,399
something that everybody experiences
everyday

750
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,740
okay maybe somebody would give right
here right now

751
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,899
hong and all the just don't throw we
just don't know very much about

752
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:15,920
uh... is kind of experiences

753
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,059
jerome singer then at the city
university of new york now would be a

754
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:19,700
real

755
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,950
i got interested in this is a clinical
psychologist

756
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,750
and worked on daydreaming with org
registered because john m traverses now

757
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,929
will levy

758
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:28,480
researcher

759
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,610
in the area of uh... of sleep cognition

760
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,289
and again watch like tell again and i
consume

761
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:38,050
they're just sat down one day mother sat
down for a couple of days

762
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,489
and tried to formulate

763
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:41,659
a questionnaire that was first

764
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:42,629
every album

765
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:44,720
magical aspect of daydreaming

766
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,910
that you could think of

767
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:50,170
how frequently you dream how frequently
daydream compared to make dreaming

768
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,929
how often you have problem solving
daydreams

769
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:57,440
how often you have guilty daydreams or
who were elected dreams or sexual d

770
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,100
dreams are any kinda daydream you can
imagine

771
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,380
on big od that they don't the plugged
into the song

772
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,430
that this questionnaire

773
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,850
so hugely long questionnaire

774
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,529
also long that

775
00:34:09,529 --> 00:34:12,939
it's very difficult to get people
actually

776
00:34:12,939 --> 00:34:13,909
birthday

777
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,619
are there's a short version

778
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:19,659
solve all cigarette that produces
daydreaming questionnaire colby

779
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:22,100
po imaginable proc

780
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,119
imaginable

781
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,839
imaginable across the seas inventory

782
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,549
uh... which is also available in the
lecture supplements on uh...

783
00:34:29,549 --> 00:34:30,370
funds or chin

784
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,839
and if you want to fill that out and
kind of reflect on your daydreaming

785
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:34,950
on you can do that

786
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,359
as well

787
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,449
in the same way that tell again used
factor analytic techniques to try to

788
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:45,129
understand the basic dimensions on
daydreaming

789
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:47,819
singer adventure beside their colleagues

790
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:53,169
home http the same thing with their very
very very long imaginable

791
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:55,139
magical prophecies inventory

792
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,979
and they basically all found

793
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:59,460
after all of that work

794
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,040
all you could measure people's
daydreaming

795
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,330
part of the activity

796
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:06,719
on a scale that had basically three
dimensions

797
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,529
the degree of positive ur constructive
daydreaming

798
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:15,129
if you say on had a really good idea
once in a day dream more almighty

799
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:17,090
bookman my fantasies provide me with

800
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:17,989
with with

801
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:20,139
pleasant thoughts

802
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:22,119
second a dimension of guilt

803
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,860
and fear of failure

804
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,339
on daydreams

805
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:25,880
where

806
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,840
in my fantasies of friend discovered
five lauded

807
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,559
or imagine myself

808
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,029
those log

809
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,699
so some people have a lot of those they
dreams

810
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,609
all up and then finally

811
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:38,599
there was a dimension

812
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,289
poor attentional control

813
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:44,309
you're not necessarily have been
positive daydreams are not destroyed

814
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,829
negative david here just having a lot of
difficulty focusing your attention on

815
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:51,319
whatever it is you're supposed to be
paying attention to

816
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:54,569
i'm the kind of person who fought for
wonder

817
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,539
and i find that i huh

818
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:01,329
lose more all that was interesting
things that i'm trying to work on

819
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:02,950
sorry for that

820
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,009
of

821
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:06,039
in any event

822
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,470
these of course art more

823
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,120
clinical personality aspects of
daydreaming

824
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,090
what's happened in the more recent
literature

825
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,989
is that people have

826
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:16,320
they'll have begun to focus on

827
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,839
daydreaming as an infant from

828
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,920
poor attentional control

829
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,679
in absorption

830
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,009
fixed your attention on one object

831
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:26,400
still consciousness without

832
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,190
with poor attentional control

833
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,350
and in daydreaming

834
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,890
your thoughts are moving off

835
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,710
or what you're supposed to be doing
again it is in that sense

836
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,689
an altered state

837
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:39,089
of consciousness

838
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:39,890
alm

839
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,059
and just kind of show you that the big
removes or if you're a somewhat

840
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:43,779
different

841
00:36:43,779 --> 00:36:46,999
here are some correlation to fit the
puja billy

842
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:50,159
better correlation between hypnotized
glued absorption in this particular

843
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,089
study

844
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:54,199
but the correlations whipsawed
daydreaming

845
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,849
not so great

846
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:59,769
bulb sold reserve these are different
kinds of scales

847
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:01,940
how can you study this experimentally

848
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,339
well john enter busted and early study
which is kind of served as a model for

849
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:08,809
subsequent research on the hot day
dreaming

850
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:12,330
he put subjects in a uh... an evangelist
task

851
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,679
extended over a very long period of time

852
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,539
two hours

853
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:19,630
the subjects only task was to press a
button

854
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,640
or whenever

855
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,749
while he or she heard a particular tone

856
00:37:23,749 --> 00:37:26,009
atone all of a particular

857
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:26,949
pitch

858
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:28,810
and just to kind of keep everybody awake

859
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,739
for two hours and make the cuts will
build more interesting

860
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:34,999
he gave them a monetary incentive every
time they were right

861
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:36,400
home every time there was a hit

862
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,479
that is not a false alarm

863
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,770
on they got uh...

864
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,009
they got four months of money

865
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:46,009
and in the experiment what activist did
was to very

866
00:37:46,009 --> 00:37:51,369
the information though that is a very
that the the difficulty of the past

867
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:56,119
on on some conditions dog very the rate
of presentation one tone every five

868
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:00,279
seconds one point everyone second one
went on every half a second

869
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:03,389
as you can imagine when those tones are
coming at you with every

870
00:38:03,389 --> 00:38:04,760
drug twice a second

871
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,689
that's very difficult

872
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,130
and then palm

873
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,869
in another fault within another
manipulation

874
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:14,080
he buried the number of tones that were
presented to people

875
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,160
single tone

876
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,710
three tone two tones are three tones as
you can imagine

877
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,410
if somebody's presenting you

878
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,680
three tones very quickly

879
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,290
okay very rapid rate

880
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,650
that's very hard to detect it's harder

881
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,319
to detect of the uh...

882
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:29,650
the target drone

883
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,519
at the same time

884
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,409
every fifteen seconds to this expert

885
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:35,059
brief if

886
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:37,309
dean seconds for two

887
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:39,339
hours

888
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:41,130
on d_-day subplots and point

889
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:44,969
and what you prob is that what do you
think about right now

890
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:49,929
and of course the correct answer s i'm
talking about your damn tones

891
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:51,819
all but in fact what would happen

892
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:55,400
is this what is one thing about my
girlfriend or a headless terrible

893
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,720
telephone conversation with my mother
last night or

894
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,390
i didn't think about

895
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,749
vacation in aruba or whatever it is

896
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:03,319
what are not

897
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:04,800
psychologists have a wonderful

898
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,590
pension for this

899
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,109
for coming up with little acronyms

900
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:11,230
task unrelated intrusive

901
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,309
plots

902
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:16,929
uh... that's what did they dream is that
that task on a related intrusive all

903
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:17,510
thought

904
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,639
and he tried to measure the occurrence
of these two words

905
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,399
all as a function almost as a function
of information load

906
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:26,460
and you can get it here's the load

907
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,609
one three or five

908
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:30,219
stimuli being presented

909
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:32,710
add a low medium or high rate

910
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,759
of uh... of presentation

911
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:36,619
and what you can see here is that

912
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:38,930
when you increase the load

913
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,029
on the subject

914
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:41,900
the frequency of daydreams

915
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,599
tends to

916
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,430
when you've got

917
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,349
excess

918
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:49,789
cognitive capacity

919
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:53,529
one tone coming at you every five
seconds that's all a lot of time to

920
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:57,019
think about a rule in your girlfriend
and your mother

921
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,319
all and that's what people do

922
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:03,140
they tend to drift off to get abs on
uh... and spend time

923
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,369
talking about

924
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:07,249
that thinking about other kinds of
things

925
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:11,709
more recently called part of the uh...
set of investigators

926
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:15,169
have bought them expanded this concept
of tulips

927
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:17,899
past for related intrusive of fort

928
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:20,829
uh... into a kind of a home

929
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:25,299
to buy two of the home of the four-fold
table here where they classify people's

930
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:28,599
thoughts in terms of their task
relatedness

931
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:31,229
and if there's stimulus dependency

932
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,529
and they find here

933
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:34,419
that there are

934
00:40:34,419 --> 00:40:37,130
two different this lead to different
kinds of tulips

935
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:41,340
they're ones that are stimulated by the
stimulus itself but kinda takes you

936
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,880
offer another direction

937
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,859
and then there is mine won't mind
wondering uh... we're daydreams of uh...

938
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:49,559
uh... come the classic example

939
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,129
of the past unrelated

940
00:40:52,129 --> 00:40:55,619
intrusive intrusive floor

941
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,700
plone

942
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,720
donald broadband this is the same
broadbent too is that attention their

943
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,029
many many many weeks ago

944
00:41:03,029 --> 00:41:05,220
for first cognitive model

945
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,830
osvaldo dot short term memory has gotten
involved in this all by developing a

946
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,789
cognitive failures questionnaire

947
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:16,729
so olympian kind of assess

948
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:20,209
occurrences of daydreaming and want mine
one million people give forget people's

949
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:21,219
names

950
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:25,170
you find yourself only wondered whether
you've used the word correctly

951
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,119
defined did you find your project

952
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,619
on why you went from one part of a host
of the other

953
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:30,960
the search for answers a

954
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,489
some people have more often than others

955
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:34,660
home

956
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,339
and all again are kind of

957
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:41,229
uh... intended to measure kind of
disposition all

958
00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:43,069
disposition aligned one

959
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:46,380
again we can bring these kinds of
experiences into wild

960
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,499
into the laboratory

961
00:41:50,499 --> 00:41:54,119
jonathan schooler now with the
university of california santa barbara

962
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,480
has done a number of studies of what he
calls the zoning out

963
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,219
what technical term

964
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:02,200
zoning out are during the during reading

965
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,130
bring subjects in the laboratory

966
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,259
and ask them to read and attention
demanding tax

967
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:09,259
hold

968
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:11,690
textbook passage or some kind of heavy

969
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,549
uh... pros prose fiction

970
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:19,160
and then are using variance of ad
reverses although aldo

971
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,649
will probe technique

972
00:42:20,649 --> 00:42:24,869
tries to pick up all instances all vo of
mind wandering

973
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:26,729
in this particular experiment

974
00:42:26,729 --> 00:42:29,520
paws could quite interesting because he
asked subjects

975
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,800
to keep track

976
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,539
ob instances where their minds wandered
off the task

977
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:38,029
they're supposed to be redeemed reading
this tasks though that this text

978
00:42:38,029 --> 00:42:38,869
silently

979
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:41,949
on their thinking about their
girlfriends of their mothers in aruba

980
00:42:41,949 --> 00:42:43,539
on instead

981
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:44,740
all those are

982
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,049
self

983
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:49,110
instances of mind wandering the subject
is disposed to click off

984
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,499
key when they

985
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:52,450
that their minds wondering

986
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,930
all and then

987
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,329
there were older

988
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:56,050
probe caught

989
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:59,419
uh... instances where poem

990
00:42:59,419 --> 00:43:00,399
preschooler would

991
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:02,609
uh...

992
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:05,380
bring a balance eight what do you think
about right now we are paying attention

993
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,139
to text me thinking about something else

994
00:43:08,139 --> 00:43:09,620
and what he discovered here

995
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,040
uh... interestingly

996
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,770
was that subjects were often on aware
that their minds had wandered away from

997
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,929
the tax

998
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:20,789
uh... when the when the probe came
through was only at that point that they

999
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:21,739
realized

1000
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,790
i've been thinking about my mother on a
rumor

1001
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,240
or something like that

1002
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,559
instead of thinking about the tax

1003
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:28,359
palm

1004
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:31,249
so what dole what job

1005
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:33,569
what the scoreboard

1006
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,709
one to put one of the park to point out
here was that

1007
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:38,380
even when we're daydreaming

1008
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,159
were not always aware

1009
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,539
that we're daydreaming

1010
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:44,619
unless our intention is brought to it
which is if you think about it for a

1011
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:51,619
second kinda paradoxical yet

1012
00:43:56,009 --> 00:44:00,049
yeah well what what's course trying to
get out here think

1013
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:01,969
is that there's a difference between

1014
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:03,130
blanking out

1015
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:06,769
which is kind of the implication of zoe
knows

1016
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:07,250
beneath it

1017
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,099
uh... lol

1018
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:13,519
on power and the kind of letting your
mind wander onto something else

1019
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,969
and interestingly i mean here's what he
compares what defines defines as over

1020
00:44:16,969 --> 00:44:19,169
and over and over again said it's it's
really

1021
00:44:19,169 --> 00:44:21,109
that's not what you'd expect

1022
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:25,839
december's probe and say what it comes
from a think about

1023
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,199
i was thinking about my mother on a roof

1024
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,289
and this is that

1025
00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:32,670
and these are the actually ask the
question

1026
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,930
were you aware that you were thinking
this before right

1027
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,869
sent the probit

1028
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:41,969
and subjects would blow very frequently
say

1029
00:44:41,969 --> 00:44:44,299
geez you know i wasn't

1030
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:48,039
and just once in the wherein he contest
their memory for the tax they can see

1031
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:51,440
that there's been a lapse in attention
to the text we know that there

1032
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,599
wind was

1033
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:54,639
was directed elsewhere

1034
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:57,969
they just don't seem to realize what was
going to the flight in a couple of

1035
00:44:57,969 --> 00:44:58,960
minutes funnel

1036
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,449
do it here instead

1037
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:02,800
it's on the basis of that kind of
finding

1038
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,700
that all of the bed schooler blasted the
distinguished between two kinds the

1039
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,389
consciousness

1040
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:11,410
one which you called basic consciousness
which is

1041
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:14,089
kind of what's goin for your mind at the
moment

1042
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,879
and that the other what he what he wants
to call

1043
00:45:16,879 --> 00:45:18,009
met up

1044
00:45:18,009 --> 00:45:19,579
consciousness

1045
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:21,170
this is going to be tricky

1046
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:25,180
your awareness of what's going on
through through your mind at the moment

1047
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,739
and so there's a difference between

1048
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:29,079
you having thoughts about

1049
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:33,219
your mother on a rule book

1050
00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:33,569
realizing

1051
00:45:33,569 --> 00:45:37,819
where your awareness that those thoughts
of what our what was going through your

1052
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:38,429
mind

1053
00:45:38,429 --> 00:45:40,499
so i can track the fall

1054
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:41,599
schooler s

1055
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,080
recently proposed uh... kind of
three-level

1056
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,049
classification of conscious experience

1057
00:45:46,049 --> 00:45:49,069
where there's what he called basic
consciousness

1058
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:50,249
and for him

1059
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:54,629
basic are just as simply as mental
activity of any kind

1060
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:59,499
also whatever your per cbm whatever
you're feeling or or or whatever

1061
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:01,119
and then there's what he calls me

1062
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,699
meta consciousness

1063
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:04,160
which but by which he means

1064
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,619
a person's reflective awareness the
person's work fault

1065
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:09,939
i'm thinking about

1066
00:46:09,939 --> 00:46:13,309
or i'm thinking about my mother runner
ruble run thinking about my mother with

1067
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:16,429
my girlfriend or cold war

1068
00:46:16,429 --> 00:46:17,200
whatever

1069
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,469
which is this is not the same thing as
thinking these thoughts

1070
00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:24,089
it's being aware that you're thinking of
them you're thinking about thinking

1071
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:25,530
which is why you calls it

1072
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,799
medic consciousness

1073
00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:28,360
and then this third level

1074
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,189
which he thinks is essentially
unconscious

1075
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:33,189
withered he says there's a kind of

1076
00:46:33,189 --> 00:46:36,170
tacit monitoring that goes on

1077
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,489
there's the system

1078
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:39,499
that checks consciousness

1079
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:43,829
palm and uh... uh... and uh...
identifies when you're kind of gone off

1080
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:46,249
task

1081
00:46:46,249 --> 00:46:48,240
in any event will go back to the swot

1082
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,090
path of for a second on what's
interesting i think about schoolers work

1083
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:56,160
missus other guide the so-called uh...
british psychologist jonathan smallwood

1084
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,029
is doing the same kind of work

1085
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:02,559
daydreaming is not just a matter of
zoning out it's not

1086
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:03,979
then the technical term

1087
00:47:03,979 --> 00:47:08,069
it's not just a matter of your attention
lapsing then you're not paying attention

1088
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:09,179
onto anything

1089
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:11,269
he says what's happening in

1090
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:11,820
daydreaming

1091
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,549
or what he prefers to call mind
wandering

1092
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:16,910
your attention

1093
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,839
is being paid to something

1094
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:20,869
being bitten

1095
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:24,879
decoupled or dissociated all from
appropriate whatever it is you're

1096
00:47:24,879 --> 00:47:26,400
supposed to have

1097
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,239
it's not that you're not paying
attention

1098
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:30,869
you are paying attention

1099
00:47:30,869 --> 00:47:33,400
you're just paying attention to
something you're not supposed to be

1100
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,170
paying attention to at the time

1101
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:37,150
fourth-year your

1102
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,099
donna attentional control

1103
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:40,059
has shifted

1104
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:41,519
from the primary task

1105
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:43,809
to what he calls personal goals

1106
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:47,509
and what's interesting about this is

1107
00:47:47,509 --> 00:47:51,709
palm wherein you daydream

1108
00:47:51,709 --> 00:47:57,199
you can show that they dreaming consumes
cognitive capacity because the berry act

1109
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:59,319
of danger imeem

1110
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:00,470
on interfere

1111
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,490
with ongoing cognitive processing

1112
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,920
you'll make errors you'll have slower
reaction times they'll have all sorts of

1113
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,589
things

1114
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:11,489
so daydreaming itself is although it is
something that will consume attentional

1115
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,379
resources

1116
00:48:13,379 --> 00:48:18,739
on and another fighting all of them from
this literature that's quite interesting

1117
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:21,069
dub better you'll get

1118
00:48:21,069 --> 00:48:23,689
at the primary task

1119
00:48:23,689 --> 00:48:30,129
though more likely you are to daydream
during that primary task

1120
00:48:30,129 --> 00:48:31,659
why is that

1121
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:32,270
because

1122
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:37,210
if you get better at task it's becoming
more automata you are not devote you're

1123
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:40,749
not you don't have to devote your full
attention resources to

1124
00:48:40,749 --> 00:48:43,959
plane tetris or playing checkers
whatever that you're doing

1125
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:46,120
you're just working on automatic pilot

1126
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,500
that frees up a lot of cognitive
resources those cognitive resources they

1127
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,379
don't just sit there empty

1128
00:48:52,379 --> 00:48:57,089
you know like a bullet wound that hasn't
been inflated or something like that

1129
00:48:57,089 --> 00:49:02,289
their devoted to dogwood two-year-old
pure daydreams

1130
00:49:02,289 --> 00:49:04,349
daydreaming can be

1131
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:06,939
from go from schoolers point of view
anyway

1132
00:49:06,939 --> 00:49:08,669
daydreaming ten b

1133
00:49:08,669 --> 00:49:09,329
unconscious

1134
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:11,029
in the sense

1135
00:49:11,029 --> 00:49:12,980
people often don't realize

1136
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,100
that they're daydreaming

1137
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,249
that their attention

1138
00:49:15,249 --> 00:49:17,159
has shifted

1139
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:18,619
the ongoing task

1140
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:20,809
for their personal goals

1141
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:22,359
bulb

1142
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:26,189
on there's no conscious awareness of the
daydream itself

1143
00:49:26,189 --> 00:49:30,829
those i think are pretty provocative
ideas the idea that you're

1144
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:34,309
conduct not be aware of what you're
thinking about

1145
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:36,979
all but we've seen him so that in the
past

1146
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:41,349
or when we've looked at things like
implicit perception of implicit memory

1147
00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:42,299
implicit flawed

1148
00:49:42,299 --> 00:49:44,949
so it's not pearly

1149
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:45,959
beyond that

1150
00:49:45,959 --> 00:49:49,420
bones possibility

1151
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,640
also use

1152
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:57,640
only go okay

1153
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:05,109
he argues because again he observes that
when he sense in this probe

1154
00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:06,630
and for those

1155
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,479
what do you think you are right now so i
was thinking about my mother

1156
00:50:10,479 --> 00:50:13,759
that next question is

1157
00:50:13,759 --> 00:50:16,709
what were you aware at the time the
probe occurred that you were thinking

1158
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:17,719
about your mother

1159
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:22,299
and subjects will sometimes answered no

1160
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:24,069
quite interesting

1161
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:25,129
in any event

1162
00:50:25,129 --> 00:50:30,019
the point of this is that here in the
ordinary course of everyday living

1163
00:50:30,019 --> 00:50:33,429
or experiences that everybody has

1164
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:37,210
experiences of absorption experiences or
flow

1165
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:41,500
experiences of getting swept away by
books and movies are all sorts of things

1166
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,369
one good getting swept away by our
daydreams

1167
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:45,609
and we have

1168
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,520
almost no experimental literature

1169
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,719
on any of its

1170
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:52,549
that's a shame

1171
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:57,129
all and so on that next time i'm going
to talk about some of these exotic

1172
00:50:57,129 --> 00:50:58,039
experiences

1173
00:50:58,039 --> 00:50:58,650
on mats

1174
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:02,920
that there'd be very sexy studies about
his end monks meditating mood electrodes

1175
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,809
on their heads and all of that

1176
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:06,059
but there's a lot

1177
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:07,800
of the same kind of

1178
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,809
shift unconsciousness that occurs in the
ordinary course of everyday living

1179
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:17,139
and that deserves experimental
exploration

1180
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:18,129
thanks we'll see you on wednesday
