1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,360
let's continue our discussion palm

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,770
various psychological approaches the
consciousness

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,550
by picking up the topic called

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,079
attention

5
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:16,299
and we do this in a large part because
of tension there has been one of the

6
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,699
primary ways in which psychologists

7
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:23,619
have interpreted the notion of
consciousness fall all these many years

8
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:24,420
so that

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,519
you can think about

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,880
attention for the process of attending

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,739
as the process of bringing something
into consciousness if you pay attention

12
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:34,579
to something you become aware of it

13
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:39,480
if you're not paying attention to
something

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,330
palm related construct in psychology is
what's known as primary memory

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,250
sometimes known as short term memory
sometimes known as working memory

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,460
these are three different terms of
psychologists now used to refer to

17
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,110
roughly the same thing

18
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,930
which is the idea of the world which is

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,610
the place in the mind if you will

20
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,130
information resides while we're working
on it

21
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,660
if i you know i ask you to

22
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:11,700
are performed poster mathematical
computation like adb two plus seven

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,370
true and seven you're holding them in
working memory what you bring to bear

24
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,789
ear knowledge of rules of addition

25
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:19,430
retrieved from long-term memory

26
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,390
and then the answer appears and work in
memory of leads you to do

27
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,370
to too well could it

28
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,600
so working memory is that there is the

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,790
the place and work in the in the mind if
you will where we maintain

30
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,790
an object

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,150
in awareness while were working on it
cognitively

32
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,460
and these two a psychological constructs
attention and short term are working

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,729
memory relent

34
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:45,419
because the general idea is that

35
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:47,850
attention is the pathway

36
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,910
artist the gateway

37
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,479
too short term memory

38
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,509
we bring things

39
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,330
we were we bring information into

40
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,170
on where artists

41
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,520
by virtue paying attention to it

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,809
while were aware of it

43
00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:00,940
it resides in working memory

44
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,019
when we stopped paying attention to it

45
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,159
it drops out of work in memory

46
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,340
and it drops out malval of consciousness

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,939
so we want to do for the next couple of
days is to talk about some of them this

48
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,470
is the tunes

49
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,029
of attention

50
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:18,010
all as if there is on the question of
all

51
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,289
about consciousness

52
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:20,549
and as you'll see it

53
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,769
duds as we get to the end of this

54
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,700
gone we're going to there with the
moment make a transition

55
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,420
into the next module the chorus which
has to do with the concept of

56
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,019
unconscious mental life

57
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,729
also tend to start early in the
courtroom footnote

58
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:40,829
we start our discussion of attention
early in the course because as william

59
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:44,629
james that everybody knows what it
engenders

60
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,419
famous james ian stabler rhinos what
attention is it is that taking

61
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,239
possession by the mine in clearing vivid
form

62
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,250
of one out of what seems several

63
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,400
simultaneously

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,219
possible

65
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,669
objects or trains of thought

66
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:03,259
sonya part here is kind of a under the
hood like capturing

67
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:05,419
all the nineteenth century

68
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:10,780
uh... introspective analysis of
attention which form the basis for

69
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,209
tremendous amount of work
twentieth-century psychology

70
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:15,870
and a continuing of control

71
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,569
the president ah...

72
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,119
up until the present moment

73
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:23,259
this was an older james had to say about
attention

74
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:26,919
all he made it clear on the basis of his
introspection this

75
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,959
that there were a lot that that
attention came in various forms that

76
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,019
there were several different varieties
of attention

77
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,289
found for example he distinguish between
what he called sense so really tension

78
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:40,329
and intellectual attention

79
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,459
whereas

80
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,439
the sense or ill attention as its name
implies is directed towards sense

81
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,329
objects the things we're seeing or
hearing or smelly norte stinger feeling

82
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,799
or touching or whatever

83
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,920
and intellectual attention

84
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,859
attention was directed inwards

85
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:57,209
towards our former

86
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,949
or ideas or images

87
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,889
home as opposed to something that's out
there

88
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,979
volume medial in the world

89
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:10,049
and james further distinguish between
what he called immediate attention and

90
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,609
ap receptive attention

91
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:13,140
bulb

92
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,079
here noted that you did what he called
the media that the tension

93
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,339
well it's back up for a second we pay
attention objects because they're

94
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:20,980
interested

95
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,879
okay that's why we do it

96
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,589
alm

97
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:28,369
and in the media detention the object is
intrinsically interesting to talk or

98
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:32,110
relevance jumping out at you or a car
that's coming toward you were asylum

99
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,049
that

100
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:35,919
that appears all

101
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:36,800
unexpectedly

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,709
and then when he told appa receptive
attention using the old term a

103
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:43,849
perception that you don't see in the
literature very much anymore

104
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:44,649
or where

105
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:47,449
your the attention that you pay to an
object

106
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:51,729
they're not interested in the object but
your there at your attention the objects

107
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:54,699
dot object is derived from

108
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,210
that your interest in some other thing
that it's related to

109
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,560
and then finally james make some of the
distinction between passive attention on

110
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,789
the one hand

111
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:06,120
and active attention on the other hand

112
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,689
whereas passive attention is

113
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:12,490
reflex of the nature it's involuntary in
nature you can't help

114
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,439
but pay attention to some object

115
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,569
all of that would be passive attention

116
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,040
whereas active attention

117
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,540
has more of the nature of a voluntary

118
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,080
on cognitive cognitive activity

119
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,160
you could do it

120
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,940
or uh...

121
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,020
you can do it or not

122
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,539
so that's not that's that particular

123
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,370
uh... distinctions

124
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,639
now market doesn't marvin chun who is
one of the one of our psychologies job

125
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,089
but paul

126
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:41,269
all most interesting oklahoma modern

127
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:42,379
contemporary attention

128
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:43,970
uh... theorists

129
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,349
in a recent review he bob what kind of
put these aspects of attention

130
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:52,129
in a somewhat different form he pointed
out first

131
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:55,709
or the major property of account all of
attention

132
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:59,709
or one that will come back to over and
over and over again in this lecture and

133
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:00,860
uh...

134
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,229
is one of limited capacity

135
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:09,750
the environment is very complicated what
james referred to as a blue mean buzzing

136
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,729
confusion

137
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:11,180
although

138
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,749
and that presents

139
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:16,630
for all the uh... we'll go to our own
food sensory receptors

140
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,520
or whole lot more information

141
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,479
then we could prosecute lee although god
the possibly

142
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,999
keep track of

143
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,780
arms so that

144
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,669
lots of things going on in the world

145
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:32,060
but only very few of them will be a very
limited subset of those things

146
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,910
ten-week a any attention to

147
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,120
at any particular time

148
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,809
because some of the limited capacity
nature of attention

149
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:42,120
we have to select

150
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,479
among the available objects and events

151
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,879
homes on the death of uh... present
themselves in the world

152
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,289
punch on the home

153
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:55,009
as this image of multiple stimuli
multiple events objects and events

154
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:56,169
competing for attention

155
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:57,789
and we have to pick some

156
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:02,150
all and uh... and ignore alone and
ignore all others

157
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,060
third

158
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,900
altman of the process of attention on
here is what

159
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,829
latrone calls modulation

160
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:09,789
whereas

161
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:13,199
playing up the pain attention to
something

162
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,520
facilitates processing of that thing
facilitates

163
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,759
our cognitive analysis of that thing

164
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,990
whereas

165
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,380
not paying attention to something

166
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,610
inhibits

167
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,610
processing of these kinds of things so
if you want to make sense of something

168
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,789
to one interpret something if you want
to add a y_ sued for

169
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:32,889
you've really got to pay attention to it

170
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:37,150
because if you don't pay attention to it
processing is somehow going to be

171
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,259
inhibited

172
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:42,189
now these the first three aspects of
attention

173
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:46,460
all alba pertained to what you might
call momentary attention somebody comes

174
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,769
in the room you look

175
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:49,839
pay attention for a minute

176
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,440
palm

177
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,610
or the fire alarm goes off you listen to
pay attention for a minute

178
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,430
but then

179
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,889
all attention also involves which one
calls vigilance

180
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,150
by which he means

181
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,849
or ability to sustain attention

182
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,559
over a fairly long period of time

183
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:09,779
attention is unjust grabbed by an object
and then grabbed by another rocket

184
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,669
despite what's going on outside in the
in the world

185
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:15,460
we can focus our attention we can pay
attention

186
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,819
to something and ignore allot of other
things that are going on

187
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:25,269
these kinds of considerations lead
trying to propose a particular

188
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:26,379
architectural attention

189
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:30,259
that makes a distinction between what he
calls external attention

190
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:30,850
and uh...

191
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,930
and internal attention

192
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,680
palm

193
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,789
and uh... various

194
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,090
sub components are both of these

195
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,220
external attention

196
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,370
again has to do with paying attention to
things that are out there in the world

197
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,310
whereas internal attention

198
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,320
has to do with paying attention to
things that are

199
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,010
on inside the mind

200
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,940
so charm proposes that

201
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:58,460
it's important to put to wildman or make
a distinction between sensory modalities

202
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,350
or attend a visual stimuli she attend
auditory stimuli

203
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,069
and the mechanisms by which we attended
these things

204
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:07,170
may be different

205
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,660
uh... depending upon the sensory
modality uh... in which they occur

206
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,250
almost

207
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,120
or were caught attention

208
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,220
are ever since the beginning of
scientific psychology

209
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,110
has been devoted to visual attention

210
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,230
of some work to toward rory attention

211
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,870
but the other or the other center
mentalities really haven't had worked on

212
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,310
or all that much are at all

213
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,370
another aspect of our interest in the
home

214
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,180
you know

215
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,620
visual attention

216
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,779
is all of the big is of wealth of
research

217
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,679
on spatial attention of the of ribble to
pay attention to some

218
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,060
location in space

219
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,730
and ignore what's going on in other

220
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,110
locations

221
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,010
uh... in space

222
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,450
are similarly that's been studied a lot

223
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,330
much less studied is the idea that we
can selectively attended things of the

224
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,050
current particular temporal locations

225
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,440
particular points uh... in time

226
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,670
follow join points out that we also
would tend not just to the objects that

227
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,409
occur

228
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,140
followed that the present themselves and
the environment

229
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,910
but also to the features

230
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,760
so you've got to be able to focus your
attention down

231
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,000
on elementary holland

232
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,900
up aspects of objects

233
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,230
turning attention

234
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,860
turning our attention to internal
attention

235
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,090
so what what kinds of things that we
have time to that are going on inside

236
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,660
certain inside our heads

237
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,329
palm

238
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:34,720
first what he called

239
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,880
task selection

240
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,760
we've got a bit www

241
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,110
have goals

242
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,740
well for processing

243
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,950
on you want to get his walk by as much
as you can out of a lecturer or you want

244
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,830
to

245
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,890
focus on

246
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,430
the tweak that you're sending or

247
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,370
although the world or the one that
you're getting or whatever it is that

248
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,020
you're doing

249
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,980
you've got some task that you're trying
to fulfill

250
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,259
and that's not something that's out here
in the world

251
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,709
that's something that you've got

252
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,850
that is more or less all moralists
internal

253
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,760
also relieve your pain attention to the
tune to information from long-term

254
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,620
memory

255
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,970
are defy askew some kind of wild

256
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,640
that's a trivia question jeopardy
question whatever

257
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,060
you've got to search through long-term
memory for all of them for the answer

258
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,060
and it run

259
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,100
like james

260
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,730
simply points out that searching through

261
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,980
dot vast mental storehouse of long-term
memory to find an answer to a question

262
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,670
it's really not all that different

263
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,270
from searching through the environment

264
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,280
to find something that you're going to
focus on

265
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,829
and then finally although there is
working memory on concept that i on that

266
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:42,740
that delay introduced earlier

267
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,300
basically is this become mental staging
area

268
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,550
where reaper

269
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,160
the various processes

270
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,040
that are

271
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,880
that are necessary for cognition

272
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,100
so that's one passed through what we
might call the architecture of attention

273
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,640
how attention israel

274
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,310
is structured

275
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:06,380
all another has psalm done through the
architectural attention is provided by

276
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,210
berkeley's own bill prince metal uh...
working club where she was a graduate

277
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,360
student barbara landau

278
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,949
all who made a distinction between

279
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:15,850
voluntary

280
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,260
blending involuntary attention again

281
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,440
another day yelled

282
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,930
of the the distinction that was ritually

283
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,140
proposed by william james

284
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,430
voluntary attention or what

285
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,350
uh... some authors

286
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,590
cold and dodge innocent pension

287
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,230
is attention that we pay to that we
actually paid to

288
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,859
some kind of oval

289
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:38,880
of external q

290
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,060
home

291
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,100
i decide

292
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,649
i'd choose i select what i'm going to
pay attention to in the outside world

293
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,220
what it is i'm going to ignore

294
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,890
palm and um...

295
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,210
told the principal points out that
voluntary attention is always goal

296
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,419
directed you have a reason for

297
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:58,140
turning your attention

298
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,569
from one thing

299
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:01,600
and to another

300
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,960
and god that's quite different from what
he calls involuntary attention on what

301
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,520
some walkers call exogenous attention

302
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,900
where attention is just capture by
something

303
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,330
you don't have some goal in mind you
don't intend

304
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,590
part two of them to pay attention to
something

305
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,370
but you just capture nice example very
familiar example

306
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,440
or logo's on t-shirts and things like
that

307
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,250
you've got this nice plain background
and you've got this thing here which

308
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,350
happens to be at u_c_ berkeley

309
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,410
cognitive science all the logo

310
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,410
if the somebody's coming toward you when
you're where they're needed just not

311
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,390
look at anything

312
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,580
object is going to stand out and it's
going to capture your attention your

313
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,900
eyes can't help

314
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,779
but be drawn

315
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,099
uh... to this song

316
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:45,970
to the subject

317
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,210
stimulus driven

318
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,850
all up and up rings metal alarm bell
make the point

319
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,659
whereas

320
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:53,990
you can

321
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,310
attention voluntarily

322
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,440
to both

323
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,070
external upload all of the matter is and
internal matters

324
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,050
involuntary attention

325
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,310
is something that is really just
captured

326
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,590
by above them

327
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,800
by objects that are

328
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,000
that are external

329
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,830
i'm not sure whether that's really true

330
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,890
to be honest with you they are not that
i think that's

331
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,080
usually true

332
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,160
but in or in the psychology of memory
for example we have a concept now called

333
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,070
involuntary memories

334
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,160
where you just kind of

335
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,720
sitting there and all the sudden this
memory occurs to you all of nowhere for

336
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,059
no good reason

337
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:31,230
on at all

338
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,790
and it seems to me that those kinds of
involuntary on the memories

339
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,160
capture our attention it but in exactly
the same way that external cues capture

340
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,010
our attention

341
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,540
that's a debate

342
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,270
uh... sometime

343
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,510
and up until one bundle simply point out

344
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,380
these two hundred attention really are
different

345
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,770
they have different behavioral effects

346
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,210
pain voluntary attention to something
affects both the accuracy of processing

347
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,320
and response latency

348
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,180
reaction time

349
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,390
whereas involuntary processing palm the
heart xlr response latency and doesn't

350
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,980
really have any effects on the accuracy

351
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,480
hopeful processing

352
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,200
frens melamine bell also have very good
evidence now that voluntary and

353
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,639
involuntary attention

354
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,130
or mediated by different brain systems

355
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,050
different parts of the brain light up

356
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,080
when your attention is being captured

357
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,110
by external q

358
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,590
as opposed to when you're

359
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,850
actively deployed attention

360
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,060
okay so it's just kind of background

361
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,840
all of the denoted picture of some of
the vocabulary of attention

362
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,300
let's see what people of done with this

363
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,060
palm

364
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,100
in the yard fifty some years austin's
song

365
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,940
people started

366
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,990
really working on the problem

367
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,100
alm first actually is stuck just dot
just the four of them

368
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,880
well first of the blast fifty years was
the first fifty years through to some

369
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,900
extent

370
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,280
all robert s woodward flown as i
mentioned in my very first lecture

371
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,799
did a bunch of studies on what's known
as the span of apprehension

372
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,550
which really isn't the question of

373
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,090
how many things can we pay attention to

374
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,390
on at once

375
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,290
the in world war two when there's not
for the first time certainly lots of

376
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,509
airplanes flying over

377
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:22,530
uh... ltd dot blog apart in space

378
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:22,900
palm

379
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:29,230
this problem was uh... became of the
important applied issue the polar bear

380
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,050
traffic control you've got an air
traffic controller

381
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,740
trying to keep track of airplanes

382
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,390
how many can he or she keep track of on
at once

383
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:42,520
and i think i mentioned this also before
bill fell laboratories on wendell

384
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,090
i mean stuff started dull producing dial
telephones and people started getting a

385
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,810
sign telephone numbers which they didn't
always have

386
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,380
home

387
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,760
had to figure out

388
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,090
or what the maximum

389
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,870
where the were the optimum length of a
telephone number one the answer is

390
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,149
always something like

391
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:01,240
seven plus or minus two

392
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,760
the magical number seven plus or minus
two and uh... those george miller put it

393
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,570
we seem to be able to keep up seven
things that our heads

394
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,030
uh... at once

395
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,320
uh... and that's uh... that's all of
that

396
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,250
and these early studies of span of
apprehension

397
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,240
gave us

398
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,029
all what dogwood worth called the first
facts about uh...

399
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:23,169
about attention

400
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:24,390
first is that is limited

401
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,610
as i said

402
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,460
the warning so many things you can keep

403
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,910
all of the focus of attention

404
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,360
uh... at any time

405
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,059
and the second power point

406
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,690
is that are tension can be controlled

407
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,640
than a week and deliberately

408
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,700
shift our attention from one thing to
another

409
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,400
attention isn't just captured

410
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,220
faisal unexpected or highly salient
tough

411
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,220
stimulus input

412
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,179
we could also

413
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:50,020
pay attention

414
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,049
you can also deploy attention

415
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:53,950
and again this general idea

416
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,270
that attention is somehow hong somehow
the path

417
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,780
sold what happens

418
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,789
when people first started talking about
attention

419
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:03,370
followed that

420
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,550
taught in the yard

421
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,150
in the in the fifties

422
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,700
a lot of or work was so dry did by
what's not what's now known as the

423
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,830
filter model of attention proposed by
donald broadbent in english

424
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,610
they were psychologist

425
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:19,580
and this is interesting this is
basically a version of broadband

426
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,780
so-called although the famous director

427
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,840
this is the first time that offload
chart was ever used to represent the cog

428
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,809
yellowstone of psychological theory

429
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:33,280
so of broadband argued that there is

430
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,090
there are a benz in the environment

431
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,790
and all the allowed these events

432
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,640
impinged on our sensory receptors

433
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,580
and information from the sensor
receptors is copied into what broad band

434
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,590
called a short-term or store

435
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,340
and from for broad term for broadband
solved noble purposes

436
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,830
the short term store

437
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,420
have held a copy of everything that was
going on all the whole blooming bosnian

438
00:18:59,420 --> 00:18:59,960
confusion

439
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,620
was represented in short term island in
the short term store

440
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,759
and then all broadbent argued

441
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,309
that there is a selective filter applied

442
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:09,940
let's

443
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,730
poorly a very small subset

444
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,730
aldous sensory information

445
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,380
into

446
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,250
what he called a limited capacity
processor

447
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,570
which would then

448
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:24,110
processes information somehow and
restore it long-term memory or use it to

449
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,880
generate some kind of uh...

450
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,330
although some kind of response output

451
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,090
but the general idea here

452
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:30,840
was that

453
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,870
there was this

454
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,730
filter

455
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,990
that took the whole blooming buzzing
confusion

456
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,980
filtered almost all but i would

457
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,429
alltheweb

458
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:41,690
a little bit off will be a little bit in

459
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,660
the evidence for this came from studies
of auditory attention

460
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,090
by abroad ben's colleague donald cherry

461
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:53,040
all using a paradigm known as bush
hardik listening

462
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,620
all of the month of cherry was much
taken by what he called the cocktail

463
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,870
party phenomenon

464
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,400
go to a party in there lots of
conversations going on the lots of

465
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,110
people and you're having a conversation

466
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,940
and all

467
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,970
somehow you're able to focus on the

468
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,630
of the conversation you're having with
your conversation partner and somehow

469
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,950
ignore or almost all of those of the
rest was gone

470
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,070
and it really

471
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:23,150
are developed the laboratory analog of
the cocktail party phenomenon

472
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,309
homework home with it

473
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:26,790
with in terms of what he called i caught
up listening

474
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,440
you put your phones

475
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,429
and presented too

476
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:34,250
different messages

477
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,970
to different here

478
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,750
left it here is getting one message

479
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,350
and the right here is getting

480
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,720
a completely different

481
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,870
on message

482
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,929
and the instructed the yells at me

483
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:47,410
the subjects are instructed to shadow

484
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,450
one mc ear or the other

485
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,940
that is to repeat the message that's
coming over say the left your phone and

486
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,980
ignore the one

487
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,530
that's coming all over or over the right
to phone

488
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,050
and subjects who could do this pretty
well

489
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:05,110
auger cherry discovered well later on
after the trial was over

490
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,730
he'd test subjects

491
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,120
for their memory

492
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,880
for what had been presented over the on
attended

493
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,850
and found out that it was pretty that

494
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,119
are for example of subjects didn't
notice when

495
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,429
the message on the unattended channel
switched

496
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:23,260
from one language to another

497
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,630
switched from english to french or

498
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,390
we're go for the spanish or whatever

499
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,890
phone

500
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,240
he also discovered that subject didn't
notice

501
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,630
when the message of being played over
the unattended channel was generation

502
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,880
because was being played backwards

503
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,490
if it didn't notice off

504
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,650
didn't notice that what they didn't
notice however

505
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:48,120
or was when beyond the message on the
unintended channels switched between

506
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,020
uh... along

507
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,550
vocal genders which was a male boys

508
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,860
was switched to a female voice or old

509
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,270
that vice versa

510
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,620
but they didn't notice

511
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,690
switches and language

512
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,710
they didn't know that they didn't know
sila switches between forward speech and

513
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,170
uh... and uh... and backward speech

514
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,850
which led all good cherry and all
broadbent

515
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,120
to suggest

516
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,300
filter

517
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,630
interposed between the blue mean bosnian
confusion of the world and a limited

518
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:22,799
capacity are that we have four o_ for
information processing

519
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,850
was a filter

520
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,669
that filter dot out things based on
their physical

521
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,310
all the physical properties

522
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,910
so that's where the filtered through the
tension comes from this conception of

523
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,600
attention of the bottleneck or a filter

524
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,270
through which all the a very limited
amount of stuff

525
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,210
all can get through

526
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,810
there was a uh... one of the uh... an
interest in the nature of these sensory

527
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,430
stores

528
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,450
on you'll see

529
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,180
if you read in this literature

530
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,600
on uh... references to i'd konica memory

531
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,110
on that's the short term visual store

532
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:00,900
or act collect memory short term
auditorium for or whatever

533
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
and all broadbent argued that

534
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,840
all that stuff that's going on

535
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,390
people can really attend all lead to a
single communication channel

536
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,779
wrong and reaction introduced on the the
notion of

537
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:17,559
uh... surreal information processing
basically cut will be processed one

538
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:17,929
thing

539
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,900
or at the time but most important for
our purposes

540
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,500
broadband argued that attentional
selection was based on perceptual

541
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,240
features

542
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,350
you could

543
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,460
attend to some point in space

544
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,419
you could attend a some object

545
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:34,799
in space

546
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,609
all

547
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:37,860
bought you've got bought

548
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,990
that selection

549
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,350
was based on the physical features of of
the object

550
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,820
and analysis

551
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,720
of the meaning of the stimulus

552
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,299
what you might call semantic analysis

553
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,130
occurred

554
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:50,620
after

555
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,640
the attentional bottleneck

556
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,620
so just to come back here for a second

557
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,519
if you're going to see if there's going
to be a selective feature

558
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,110
the selected feature the selected filter

559
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:04,580
is applied on the basis of physical
features

560
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,490
where the object is in space

561
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,920
uh... what it looks like what it sounds
like whatever

562
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,910
and then only after

563
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,520
the material gets through this limited
capacity processor

564
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,330
is it analyzed com is about the lights
for me

565
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,390
communication channel of the time

566
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,679
attentional selection based on
perceptual features

567
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,270
semantic analysis is

568
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,470
post attentive

569
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,280
that is you can only do it after you
paid attention to something

570
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,980
not before you paid attention to
something

571
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,200
and then the filter theory also argued

572
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,059
that this

573
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:42,860
filter could be deployed in lots of
different directions

574
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,509
that attention is flexible

575
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:48,429
you can turn your attention from one
thing to another

576
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:48,950
once

577
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,450
you turn your attention

578
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,570
from one thing to a second thing

579
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,300
your ability to process

580
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:57,990
first thing

581
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,880
is now going to be severely restricted

582
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,500
onto only after you bug turn your
attention from wanting to another

583
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,930
that you've been begin to process it

584
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:12,490
on the basis of uh... on the basis of me

585
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,080
those are discarded that's where we get

586
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,820
some implications of this filter theory
of attention all four o_ consciousness

587
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,300
the first of these is that

588
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,120
perceptual analysis

589
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,320
has to be

590
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,490
thought all go

591
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,920
or unconscious

592
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,380
or if you will

593
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,059
conscious

594
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:33,000
that is

595
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,610
all uh... perceptual analysis has to
occur before attention

596
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,680
uh... this is paid to something

597
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,820
and that is just a logical e

598
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,500
true it logically follows

599
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,850
of the from the theory

600
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,050
because if you are going to pay
attention to something based on its

601
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,220
physical features

602
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,600
yeah i have to have already analyzed a
physical features of that

603
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,570
but if i'd

604
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:02,460
if by virtue of paying attention you
become aware of something that enters

605
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,700
into your consciousness for further
processing

606
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,239
then that that had blood priya tend to
processing

607
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:11,140
has to be

608
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,240
oliphant has to be essentially
unconscious

609
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,570
perceptual analysis can occur
unconsciously or at least

610
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,140
pre consciously

611
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,290
is guys didn't like to use the term
unconscious

612
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:26,150
in large part because it was all it
would have been

613
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,870
co-opted by freudian people get really
we're around freud

614
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,490
home

615
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,220
uh... sold able to hold pre consciously
or unconsciously so what do you mean by

616
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,720
precourt while i'm iran contra federal
on his word

617
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,789
uh...

618
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:45,409
audit that also follows from the filter
theory that's semantic analysis

619
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:49,940
on the identification of the stimulus
the undoubtedly the analysis of its

620
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,280
implications its meaning no of all that
semantic stuff

621
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,279
has to occur

622
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,780
all has to occur post attentively

623
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:01,550
so what we got in broad bands filter
theory of consciousness articulated in

624
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,400
the late nineteen fifties

625
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,350
is a whole bunch of assumptions that
have continued

626
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,159
of ought to uh...

627
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,870
onto world of the played out in the hall
of the in the literature attention

628
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,330
the first thing

629
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:19,429
again is the identification of attention
with consciousness so that

630
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:24,830
people will use terms like pre attentive
processing

631
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,549
palm

632
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:28,770
basically meaning pre conscious
processing

633
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,980
and the filter theory limited pre
conscious processing to perceptual

634
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,960
analyses

635
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,690
analyses of the

636
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,370
wall location

637
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,760
hauled the movement

638
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,809
haldol of an object

639
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:41,820
whereas

640
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,059
attempt a processing

641
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:46,400
was identified with conscious processing

642
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,750
and conscious processing although the
permitted semantic analysis

643
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,890
as well himself as well as perceptual
analysis

644
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:00,030
so been prediction all the filter theory
is

645
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,170
analyzing the physical features at all

646
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,750
an object or event

647
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,140
can occur

648
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,900
before you paid attention to it

649
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,120
can occur

650
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,330
pre consciously

651
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,790
unconsciously if you will pre
attentively

652
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,600
analysis of the semantic

653
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,159
features

654
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:21,030
of an object what it means how it's
connected up to other things

655
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:26,320
that requires consciousness and has to
come only be done after he had begun to

656
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,500
pay attention

657
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,649
on too

658
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:31,210
the object

659
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,169
okay

660
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:39,169
now just as well footnote on this yes

661
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,200
i'm getting there

662
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,760
and getting their there's a story

663
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,980
ed turner they'd that you can't make too
much of buggered too big a deal of discs

664
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,399
that turns out to go back to that

665
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,279
that that's true that the best for the
study people mobile cygnus thoreau names

666
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,310
as well

667
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,470
but of course

668
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,400
that's part of the cocktail party
phenomena

669
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,039
you're talking to somebody at a cocktail
party then all of the suddenly here's a

670
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,020
meticulous from

671
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,429
your attention is captured

672
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:16,200
by that where your ex-wife comes in or
something like that your attention gets

673
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,340
captured by that

674
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,570
and it's not just on the basis of
physical features of on the basis of

675
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,850
something like me

676
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,679
song the semantic analysis has to be
able to be performed pre attentively

677
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:31,220
but broadband theory didn't permit

678
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:37,020
all denver's was so let me just give you
another example of how boggled howled

679
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,900
did the absence of broadband filter
three

680
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,330
worked its way of through

681
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,450
and all moved in another domain of
cognitive psychology so-called multi

682
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,210
store models of memory

683
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,450
all proposed offer spider-man seawall
and on norman are working the homes of

684
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,030
the basically at stanford

685
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,049
dawn norman's novel

686
00:29:58,049 --> 00:29:59,700
visionary with apple

687
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,500
home and also by young richard atkinson
and avert schifrin's

688
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,949
all who were at that

689
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:06,120
point at stanford

690
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,029
rich your friend

691
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:09,590
on drugs or richard atkinson so

692
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,820
you see president

693
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,910
the same president atkinson

694
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,940
that though

695
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,410
recently retired and was replaced by
uh...

696
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,390
by president hugo

697
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,510
you'll see

698
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:26,490
then rb atkinson this is a really be
active since your friend version of the

699
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,830
theory

700
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,089
stimulus information

701
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:32,259
that's processed by a bunch of sensory
registers

702
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:37,350
and then attention is paid to tucson a
subset of what's in the sun three

703
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:42,440
registers and then held in short term
memory while it's being worked on

704
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,919
maintain it in short term memory by
means of a process of rehearsal

705
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,909
and then you can encode the some of this
information long-term memory

706
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:52,570
retrieved from long-term memory and all
that kind of business

707
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:57,740
but it's a sexually of variant on the
broadband

708
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,310
attention occurs relatively early

709
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:00,769
processing

710
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:02,349
uh... occurred so

711
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:03,639
occurs relatively late

712
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,350
now let's get to your point

713
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,250
because it turns out that there are some
problems with this filter model

714
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,389
and one of them

715
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:14,789
actually been known for a long time
noble mourey are cut all another english

716
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,610
psychologist

717
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,820
colleague oklahoma college cherries

718
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,299
all had discovered that

719
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:22,110
at least on some subset of trials

720
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,970
people would our pay attention to their
own name when it came over the

721
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,840
unattended channel

722
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,430
home they would necessarily

723
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,840
retention anybody just anybody's name
but it was their full name

724
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,739
and that suggested that there was

725
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:38,899
all that that uh... pretend to
processing could occur all with respect

726
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:40,000
to

727
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,960
also magic features as well as episodic
creatures

728
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,510
now in fact if you go back to the moret
experiment

729
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,730
you see that this actually only occurred

730
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,760
relatively small minority of trials

731
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,539
but it did occur

732
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:57,659
and the broadband theory suggested
shouldn't occur

733
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:00,430
so that was uh... so that was trouble

734
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,190
all day

735
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,110
moreover entries one

736
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:08,470
johnson's all who was actually broadband
saugov broadbent graduate student

737
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,550
although did some di ka dicuss mainulmh
uh...

738
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,659
that experiments

739
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:14,279
in which

740
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:17,920
she did did something quite clever she'd
have subjects

741
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,200
try to shadow a message that was
presented to the left ear

742
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,309
and ignore the message being presented
to the right here

743
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:27,270
but then somewhere in the middle of the
trial

744
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,059
should switch

745
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:28,899
the message

746
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:31,770
from muneer to another

747
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,840
and what you discovered was that
subjects would continue shadowing the

748
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,760
message in the wrong here

749
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,500
okay

750
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,760
and it would be the most of notice that
they were doing those volvo but the but

751
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,650
the point is

752
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:49,280
you could all lee keep track called

753
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,179
the above the shifted message

754
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:54,440
if you're making something like cement
the connections for the for the fact

755
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,810
that people could shift

756
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:59,050
this in the shadow message between all
yours

757
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,650
suggested again

758
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,300
the analysis paul vault a stimulus
import

759
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,450
on pre attentive analysis

760
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:11,360
most simply limited to physical things
all you had to be able to pick up cell

761
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,419
that based on armenian so that lead

762
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:16,610
vault gold patrice min and others

763
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,740
to suggest that

764
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,480
there was some possibility for pre
attentive

765
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,960
semantic analysis

766
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,159
as well as pre attentive

767
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:28,940
physical analysis if you're going to
pick up your own name when somebody

768
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,980
mentions it not been paid

769
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,150
if you're going to

770
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,760
follow-up message from one spot to
another

771
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,500
hard then haldeman priya ted you have to
be a while

772
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,270
notice about shift occurred

773
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,950
that saddam noticing that

774
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:45,490
that shift occurs requires somethin like
semantic analysis

775
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,429
and so

776
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:48,080
all pre attentive

777
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,450
semantic analysis has to be possible

778
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,180
put another way priya type of analysis
has to

779
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,750
go beyond physical structure so now what
do we do

780
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,960
our treatment

781
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,600
on an important paper off the hook
published uh... they see as a result of

782
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,849
her doctoral dissertation this issue she
has to be here

783
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:11,240
she retired from or berkeley in the

784
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,629
darwin to went to princeton

785
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:17,629
which wonderful place to recorder

786
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:19,329
thoughts cold

787
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:21,579
slowly

788
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:23,309
um...

789
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:27,489
rob produced facing a modification or
broadbent filter three which is known

790
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:30,849
not surprisingly as the modified filter
theory

791
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:32,470
and the first thing she says is

792
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:37,909
at smu it's wrong to think about
attention sa

793
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,009
what it really is is about ten u waiter

794
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:46,119
turns the turns some things down but not

795
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:48,290
also that the reason why

796
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,570
people could pick up there all the their
own names coming over the young

797
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,600
unattended channel

798
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,029
is not that the other tended channel is
blocked completely

799
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,050
tomb down

800
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:04,409
turndown all like the volume dane va
stereo or something like that

801
00:35:04,409 --> 00:35:05,840
and she also argued

802
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,800
that the though that the toning

803
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,620
all this on ten u waiter

804
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,890
could be modified depending on context
and goals and all that kind of stuff so

805
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,760
that wasn't the physical structure of
attention that was creating a limit was

806
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,199
something more gold directly

807
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:25,700
although the point of major point here
however is attention does not determine

808
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,509
by the physical attributes of a stimulus
alone

809
00:35:29,509 --> 00:35:33,390
what you pay attention to can be
determined by your goals

810
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:38,709
and what you probably attention to
compete deterrent body of the home

811
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:40,089
by the significance

812
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:44,489
of the uh... of the stimulus and that's
basically congress whipple

813
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:46,629
a new tradition and

814
00:35:46,629 --> 00:35:49,010
uh... no sensory psychology

815
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,249
known as signal detection theory

816
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,499
on didn't get to talk about this when we
talked about quali a

817
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:58,319
but be released like a physicist
basically argued

818
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:03,279
or whether you detected the presence or
a change in the stimulus or not that was

819
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:04,019
determined

820
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:06,979
solely by the properties of the stimulus

821
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:12,849
how intense the stimulus was or how big
the change was that's what lies behind

822
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:16,979
things like neighbor's lawn factors lawn
stephens' law and stuff like that

823
00:36:16,979 --> 00:36:21,019
and the signal detection theorist came
in and said well that's not quite right

824
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,210
it turns out

825
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:27,290
that whether you detect a stimulus is
also going to be determined by your

826
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,050
expectations

827
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:31,199
about whether a stimulus is going to
occur

828
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,709
and whether you detective stimulus is
going to be determined by

829
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:37,769
motives where your goals

830
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:38,689
part that is

831
00:36:38,689 --> 00:36:42,829
what the consequences are protecting the
stimulus as opposed to missing a

832
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:43,999
stimulus or whatever

833
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:47,229
those are computers or b

834
00:36:47,229 --> 00:36:50,749
observer of the perceived or not
features of the stimulus

835
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:53,059
all and all of the of

836
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:55,660
trees would simply

837
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,819
principal auto signal detection theory
and applied it to attention as well what

838
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:03,410
you're going to tend to spend depend on
your goals in your expectations

839
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,149
and all that

840
00:37:05,149 --> 00:37:08,329
the result of which is that patrice been
proposed

841
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:12,229
the really the first cognitive you
called

842
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:13,670
of attention

843
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:14,279
home

844
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:17,760
in the first of all of the clothing vote
theory of attention

845
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,169
that took into account something that
seriously ka

846
00:37:21,169 --> 00:37:25,419
people's beliefs expectations desires
goals

847
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:26,140
motives

848
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,139
whatever

849
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:28,689
nachos

850
00:37:28,689 --> 00:37:31,779
not just the characteristics of the
stimulus itself

851
00:37:31,779 --> 00:37:35,190
and that was she who all don't put into
place

852
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:39,539
of this very familiar distinction now in
psychology cognitive science

853
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:44,009
between bottom-up processing which is
driven by the stimulus

854
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:49,190
and top-down processing which is driven
by the goals and expectations of the

855
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,659
uh... of the procedure

856
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:53,609
bottom-up

857
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:55,469
although the driven

858
00:37:55,469 --> 00:38:00,119
top-down more or less of morris meaning

859
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,839
so that's the first vote that that's the
first kind of step away from broadband

860
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:06,849
social on the filter theory

861
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:09,060
but it wasn't and apparently it was

862
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,520
it was a kind of step

863
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,100
that a lot of people to take account of
the fact that yes you know people's

864
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,689
names will leak through and things like
that

865
00:38:16,689 --> 00:38:17,930
on you can see how that

866
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,829
could happen in a system like this

867
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:22,429
so if i'm in a cocktail party when
talking to people

868
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:25,859
i've just got a little piece of my
attentional system

869
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:26,550
looking for

870
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,119
my ex-wife for

871
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,910
won't listening for my name or whatever
it is

872
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,140
that uh... that i'm doing

873
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,249
that was enough for some people

874
00:38:36,249 --> 00:38:40,800
on diana deutsch with her husband jay
alfredo richmond don norman again

875
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,099
all propose an entirely different way of
thinking about

876
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,410
this i pensionable filter or this
attentional bottleneck

877
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,979
and especially in terms of its placement

878
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:52,430
in the information processing system

879
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:56,299
these late selection theories withdrawal
plan all proposed around the same time

880
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:57,329
in the mid

881
00:38:57,329 --> 00:38:59,380
in the mid nineteen sixties

882
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,539
were motivated by

883
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:06,150
basically anomalies a bike honestly that
these things kept proud cropping up

884
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:10,940
that before our crew dial process evolve
more semantic information

885
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:16,430
they've even tree simmons of a modified
filter fury uh... seem to prevent

886
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:20,029
sold what are the deutsch is that what
don norman possible let's just get rid

887
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:21,209
of the filter

888
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:22,089
let's not

889
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:22,959
debate whether it's a

890
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:28,619
filter or of attenuator anything let's
just forget about any notion of filter

891
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:34,989
and instead let's assume that all input
channels boho lb

892
00:39:34,989 --> 00:39:37,479
you mean by the end confusion of the
world

893
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:39,090
his all process

894
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:39,930
and it's all

895
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,069
fully processed

896
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:42,390
and it's all

897
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:42,799
processed

898
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:46,269
in parallel that is appalled at the same
time

899
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:49,269
and that once it's all process

900
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:51,079
processed with respect to its

901
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:52,359
physical features

902
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:53,580
but also

903
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,259
fully processed with respect to with

904
00:39:56,259 --> 00:39:57,810
semantic features then

905
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,329
we pay attention

906
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:05,890
and we pay attention to it are based on
what thrown what doug norman called

907
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:06,499
prints

908
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:08,190
that is

909
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,449
permanence called

910
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:15,099
of the uh... the information for our
offer our processing goals

911
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:19,599
so attention that is required for
response to a stimulus

912
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,430
it's not required for processing or
proceeding

913
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,590
uh... yup

914
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,759
the stimulus

915
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:28,319
now these paul late selection theories
are quite interesting or show you with

916
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,779
an example of one in a second

917
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:35,009
but i don't want to uh... that i don't
want to admit

918
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:38,389
the implications of these late selection
theories for home

919
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:40,789
for the for consciousness

920
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:46,239
early selection theories of the
broadband type again just to repeat

921
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:48,069
you can process

922
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:50,299
physical attributes of the stimulus

923
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:51,309
unconsciously

924
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:56,769
but you can't process semantic features
unconscious you have to pay attention to

925
00:40:56,769 --> 00:40:59,489
have to be represented consciousness

926
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:01,659
but these wade selection filters

927
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:02,729
because

928
00:41:02,729 --> 00:41:06,119
the all the input channels are processed
fully beef

929
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:08,579
for attention is paid to them

930
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:09,719
suggested

931
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:14,979
pre attentive analysis is complete
including an analysis of the semantic

932
00:41:14,979 --> 00:41:16,830
features alva stimulus

933
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,949
as well as the uh...

934
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:20,850
as well as the physical features

935
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,740
including the meeting

936
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,909
as well as the structure

937
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:27,479
one of these things looks like

938
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:29,469
this is art

939
00:41:29,469 --> 00:41:31,840
br presentation of a bomb

940
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,240
don norman's view again we've got
stimuli impinging on the sensory system

941
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,649
we've got a bunch of analyzing
mechanisms here

942
00:41:40,649 --> 00:41:43,109
analyzed both the physical and the
semantic

943
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:44,819
features of the stimulus

944
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:46,609
and on the base of these analyses

945
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:48,799
the basically why it up

946
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:52,349
volvo relevant information in memory
creating

947
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:53,579
various

948
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,559
represent debating various
representations

949
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:59,969
and i'm not done on the side we have the
perceived all the cognitive stuff we

950
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:03,089
have the perceive urs expectations
knowledge of language

951
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:04,289
and their goals

952
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:05,329
which make

953
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:06,729
certain

954
00:42:06,729 --> 00:42:11,749
into a deluge of it which makes certain
information in memory permanent to

955
00:42:11,749 --> 00:42:13,900
current processing goals

956
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,940
what happens is

957
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,029
we pay attention

958
00:42:18,029 --> 00:42:20,580
where there is an overlap between

959
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,390
what's been activated in memory

960
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,809
through these analyzing mechanisms

961
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:27,099
and what's been activated in memory

962
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:29,690
palm on unit and a top-down fashion

963
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,990
by virtual perkins

964
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,640
so it's admits collate selection jury

965
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,489
after all the analysis has been done

966
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,319
we pay attention

967
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:42,169
to just to what's for dinner

968
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:46,429
lineal a straight this one other way
just by a clear

969
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:49,540
comparison of late and early selection
theories

970
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,799
old form

971
00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:51,689
malcolm attention

972
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:55,539
here we've got a whole bunch of stimuli
impinging on the organism

973
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,079
in early selection

974
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,879
there is of

975
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:03,119
physical analysis analysis of the
perceptual properties the physical

976
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,709
properties of a part of an object

977
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,050
based on that

978
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,179
some

979
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:09,320
subset of information

980
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,209
is selected for awareness of response
and after

981
00:43:13,209 --> 00:43:18,130
were aware of the thing then we perform
semantic analyses that's the frost of

982
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,990
all early selection theories

983
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,509
oh of attention

984
00:43:21,509 --> 00:43:23,469
by contrast

985
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:27,979
the late selection theories say gather
all these stimuli

986
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:31,010
and you do this physical analysis but
you also do

987
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,729
a semantic analysis

988
00:43:32,729 --> 00:43:35,379
although everything

989
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,630
then you become aware

990
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:41,359
one thing or another based on pertinent
sir goals or whatever

991
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,309
and you can respond to it

992
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:49,159
sojourn the selection explains very late
in the information processing

993
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,359
impression processing system

994
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:52,619
now why am i doing this

995
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:54,579
i'm doing this because

996
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:57,110
in psychology in cognitive science

997
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,790
there is a

998
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:04,159
jen are that general identification of
consciousness

999
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:06,029
attention

1000
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:08,069
raising the question of

1001
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:10,930
how much processing can go on

1002
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:13,359
before you paid attention to something

1003
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,519
oregon or terms

1004
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,750
how much process you can go on

1005
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,910
in the absence

1006
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:19,460
conscious

1007
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,969
awareness

1008
00:44:21,969 --> 00:44:24,829
all the the the problem here is

1009
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:29,079
what can you do without conscious
attention

1010
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:30,089
is

1011
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:31,080
priya tentative

1012
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,790
pre conscious processing ltd

1013
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,829
simply to the analysis of perceptual
structures

1014
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:40,779
whether where something is in space and
what it's moving in what its physical

1015
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:42,789
features or

1016
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:43,589
ken

1017
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:47,419
pre conscious or pre account of analysis

1018
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:51,440
something like semantics

1019
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,819
that turns out to be

1020
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:55,289
a serious problem

1021
00:44:55,289 --> 00:44:55,989
and

1022
00:44:55,989 --> 00:44:58,760
four on number of years all day

1023
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,170
proponents of early selection theories
and proponents of wet swatch of the

1024
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,100
reasons to do a good out in the yard

1025
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,319
in the in the meetings

1026
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,260
and basically that literature did not

1027
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,699
gold very

1028
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:12,749
home

1029
00:45:12,749 --> 00:45:13,719
and

1030
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:14,659
daniel condom

1031
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:16,140
who was also

1032
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,559
at berkeley

1033
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:19,269
alone

1034
00:45:19,269 --> 00:45:20,659
before he

1035
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:21,849
to princeton

1036
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:23,970
this is a daniel common who won the

1037
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,109
nobel prize in economics couple years
ago

1038
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:28,869
for his work on judgment and decision
making

1039
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:31,849
before he worked on judgment and
decision making he was an attention

1040
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:32,759
theorist

1041
00:45:32,759 --> 00:45:38,189
and he wrote all very important all of
the monograph on attention

1042
00:45:38,189 --> 00:45:40,609
attempted that that uh... with

1043
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:44,499
was an attempt to get psychology out of
this

1044
00:45:44,499 --> 00:45:45,580
endless debate

1045
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,849
between early selection theorists and
late selection through some attention

1046
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:52,390
basically by calling through of the
debate

1047
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:53,440
and redefining

1048
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,609
uh... various kinds of terms

1049
00:45:56,609 --> 00:45:58,359
what kind of ended first

1050
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:00,380
was to identify attention

1051
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,079
with mental effort

1052
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:03,989
that is

1053
00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:05,920
when we pay attention to something

1054
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,540
we are engaged in effort for

1055
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,360
cognitive

1056
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,559
processing

1057
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,729
that day

1058
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:16,569
also that paying attention to something
requires all minimum level volvo

1059
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:19,429
of cortical arousal

1060
00:46:19,429 --> 00:46:22,910
second he agrees with everybody going
all the way back to would worth and for

1061
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,349
that matter james

1062
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:26,959
that cognitive resources are limited

1063
00:46:26,959 --> 00:46:28,239
we can all agree

1064
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:29,399
you can only

1065
00:46:29,399 --> 00:46:33,519
or devote so much effort to certain
kinds of tasks

1066
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:35,490
there are limits to the amount of effort

1067
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:41,449
that you can alone that you can deploy

1068
00:46:41,449 --> 00:46:43,799
that come unraveled

1069
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:47,709
did gave the example one disposal i
could take a simple arithmetic problem

1070
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:50,259
like two plus two

1071
00:46:50,259 --> 00:46:56,699
now pay for a lot of attention to that

1072
00:46:56,699 --> 00:46:59,299
we can pick up a lot of attention to
that

1073
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:02,539
it doesn't deserve a lot of attention
right

1074
00:47:02,539 --> 00:47:03,110
all

1075
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:07,620
so that they are the does their assigned
tasks that you just can't pay a lot of

1076
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,420
attention to you can't devote a lot of
effort to

1077
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,309
but then there are other tasks like
redeemed for example work

1078
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:16,009
making various kinds of judgments

1079
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:19,039
that really require that you pay a total
to pay a lot of attention to what's

1080
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,109
going on

1081
00:47:20,109 --> 00:47:21,839
is that ok

1082
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,219
what we have to do because our cognitive
resources are limited

1083
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:31,739
because there is always so much
cognitive effort that we have to deploy

1084
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:33,850
what we have to but what we have to have

1085
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,179
is what he called an allocation policy

1086
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:39,599
you have to have some sense of what
you're going to pay attention to and

1087
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,790
what you're not going to pay attention
to and he says the

1088
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:45,360
art the individuals allocation policy

1089
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,149
is determined by home

1090
00:47:48,149 --> 00:47:50,699
via a number of different things

1091
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:55,789
we have or set of what he called in
doreen cognitive dispositions

1092
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,320
palm

1093
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,599
that process information more less
automatically

1094
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,199
and then we have

1095
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,249
all more transient momentary intentions

1096
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:06,689
that process information

1097
00:48:06,689 --> 00:48:10,719
more consciously and the amount of
attention we're going to pay daunted by

1098
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:11,760
the to something

1099
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,109
is going to depend upon the the man's of
the task

1100
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:19,729
therefore poor performing our bunch of
tasks that are

1101
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:22,180
cognitively on demanding

1102
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,470
breed that dog consume

1103
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:26,460
relatively few cognitive resources

1104
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,869
we can do a lot of them at once

1105
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:31,869
weakened perform brigham actually
engaged

1106
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:33,289
parallel processing

1107
00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:35,390
but therefore performing

1108
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,169
i'm very demanding task

1109
00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:43,369
very glad that very demanding past may
have to be performed one of the time

1110
00:48:43,369 --> 00:48:44,149
series

1111
00:48:44,149 --> 00:48:47,030
and you can think of all the number of
examples of this with them

1112
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,009
talked about this a little bit last time

1113
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:49,859
drivin

1114
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:50,769
driving a car

1115
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:53,069
uh... and carrying on a conversation

1116
00:48:53,069 --> 00:48:57,229
if you're driving a car on a familiar
street and it's a familiar car

1117
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:58,549
home and

1118
00:48:58,549 --> 00:49:02,030
you're basically making mindless
conversation with the person

1119
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:03,399
home for the next few

1120
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,579
you can do both of those things at once

1121
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:10,259
but the moment to get into heavy traffic
the talk stops

1122
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:14,149
or the morning to get into any
conversation yell pullover right oreo

1123
00:49:14,149 --> 00:49:17,489
slow down or you take a different wrote
or something like that

1124
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:21,649
also that you conducted do these two
things that's the that's the but basic

1125
00:49:21,649 --> 00:49:22,539
analogy here

1126
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:25,129
so the general idea here is

1127
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,669
which i will get to right at the
beginning of next class

1128
00:49:28,669 --> 00:49:30,279
for him to talk about

1129
00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:31,309
the extent

1130
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:33,860
of conscious and unconscious processing

1131
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,769
the implications all condiments capacity
three of attention

1132
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:38,669
is that

1133
00:49:38,669 --> 00:49:42,579
so long that as the processing is

1134
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,239
does not require a lot called

1135
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:47,679
mental activity allot of cognitive
effort

1136
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:51,009
we can do it preoperatively it into a
pre consciously

1137
00:49:51,009 --> 00:49:55,339
but once the task requires a lot of
cognitive activity

1138
00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:56,220
that task

1139
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,429
has to be form

1140
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:59,059
has to be performed

1141
00:49:59,059 --> 00:49:59,929
consciously

1142
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:04,569
so the implications for unconscious
processing are these

1143
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:06,640
the filter theory

1144
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,169
basically said

1145
00:50:08,169 --> 00:50:13,429
you can perform physical analyses
unconsciously but you have to perform

1146
00:50:13,429 --> 00:50:16,609
semantic analyses consciously

1147
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:19,279
the late selection theories basically
said

1148
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:25,019
you can perform both physical and
semantic processing unconsciously before

1149
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:26,899
you pay attention to things

1150
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:30,059
the capacity theory basically argues
that

1151
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:36,329
the important distinction is not whether
the processing this physical or semantic

1152
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:39,099
perceptual or in terms of meaning

1153
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:41,799
the important determinant

1154
00:50:41,799 --> 00:50:43,529
howell much

1155
00:50:43,529 --> 00:50:45,880
the task requires

1156
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,929
physical task

1157
00:50:47,929 --> 00:50:51,689
if its physical processing and it
requires a lot of cognitive effort it

1158
00:50:51,689 --> 00:50:54,190
has to be done consciously it can't be
done

1159
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,289
pre attentively

1160
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:57,599
if it's a semantic analysis

1161
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,589
but it doesn't require much cognitive
effort it can be done pre attentively

1162
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:04,729
it doesn't have to be done uh...
conscious

1163
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,249
so will pick up from next time

1164
00:51:07,249 --> 00:51:09,519
and explore the ideal

1165
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:11,660
automatic automatic processing

1166
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,499
as unconscious processes

1167
00:51:14,499 --> 00:51:16,099
thank you very much deal on wednesday
