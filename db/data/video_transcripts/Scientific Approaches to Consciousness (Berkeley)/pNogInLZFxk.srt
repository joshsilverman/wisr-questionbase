interesting that the pearly example

170
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,230
of what your medicine sakai three

171

warmer

173
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:18,860
the idea behind right out of the flood
theory is extremely episode of elements

174
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,330
if the result of the confluence of three
factors

they will be fifty you won't believe
we've active

184
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,420

187
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:57,970
was technical person one subjected for
dramatic levels

188
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,760
what would happen to believe that

189
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,940
all function would be compromised

190
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,840
off abt

has got a very weakly connected with the
pressure on the chain celebration

195
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,810
that point dot the problem

196
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,470
so the idea here

197
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,279
afford for charcoal was

198
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,630
person would come into the world already
shirley carp weakness

199

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,050
that if the person who subjected

201
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,400
of breakdown

202
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,970
stuff

203
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,620
also struggling to do things like diablo

functional regions

205
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,380
there are really brain lesions and
patient it's just appears that they're

206
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,270
just appears old

functional before

210
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:50,700
that's been there

russian introduced the idea

214
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:05,800
thought historical fiction had
psychological

215
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,810
and such things very very important to
us

216
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,220
all sorts of the discoveries

217
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,120

functional equivalent of a brain

234
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,410
if you have

235
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,730
is a constrictions over where

sorry

250
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,360
which upward which would fit with the
birth of the term very much like

life

254
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,480
one still tough

okay let me give you an example of this

284
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,550
from charcoal

285
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,470
famous case of poetry

for mother had recently dari and she had
nowhere this event for a while

289
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,610
had no idea that the model

290
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,850
however didn't

291
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,010
when she slept at night

292
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,450
she suffered from from and it wasn't

293
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,860
which he would get out of bed reenact

294
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,530
all of the process of this

295
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,810
first mother's dead body which i think
they've done

296
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,550
she would

297
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,610
talk about the site of the dead mother

298
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:52,370
she withdraw fault problem she was
responsible for the detailed reports

299
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,120
shoot reenacted movement

300
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,650
if you gave him off the republican party

301
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,240
told of her bedroom involved

302

burdensome ambulances

304
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,130
that's a bit so traumatic event we are
back to the filth infers three if she

305
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,720
had nowhere else

306
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,170
that her mother had died jimbo worked of

309
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,460
quite a movable audio golf bedroom

310
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,750
but she didnt reenact all of those
payments from bad to worse if nafta

311
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,430
fails

312
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,400
heart-wrenching to remember that

313
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,440
so what's all the boards what today
argued

314
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,150
look at this episode

315
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,330
it so that looks like a logical
automatons

316
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,180
where you had

317
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,550
gemma's actual graphic throughout the
site of the dead mother

318

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,870
irene movement the sheik at reasonable
destroyed a whole bunch of a list of all

320
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,440
kind of package together

yeah

390
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,580
let's start with the earliest

fargo the background

404
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,110
nothing much happened we didn't do too
much voted on

405
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,830
but that there were these chains of
memories

406
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,160
void with association at least

407
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,309
these changes that were used

408
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:39,890
that's all that exactly

409
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,550

413
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:51,960
again

414
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,300
there'll be some kind of what we call
the dramatic event problems

415
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,309
off-the-record heaps of stuff

416

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:08,260
i'm sure there are some kind of work at

the odds of the point here is that

quite correct listed

849
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,249
and because she couldn't identify
yourself you have no idea where they

850
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:00,849

why it was assigned to do this political
valuation

854
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:13,219
and what he did was the kind of customer
intelligence by asking her to identify

855
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:19,089
various objects to the robo rules

859
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:27,699
all is pleased with how important is
that you know what this means

860
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:30,349
and she said

861
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:34,579
telephone you know how to use a method
or other use of and i got them

show me how you can to stop

864
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:41,030
so she picked up the receipt

865
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,939
and then you've got involved

866
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:45,019
father numbers numbers of students

867
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:46,739
and so she dial the numbers

868
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:48,080
and before she could

869
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,589

telephone number listed in the parole

876
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:13,229
that's hard document storage right when
people actually knew each other

877
00:41:13,229 --> 00:41:14,819
telephone numbers

878

something like implicit memory

series of patient filtration with
multiple brutality

888
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:01,140
method here is to

00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:15,199
is at least

we don't know why

you've got transfer of inflicted

swiftly

00:45:11,219 --> 00:45:12,750

00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:07,600
we can see implicit memory spirit

untreatable disrupted disorders

980
00:46:09,459 --> 00:46:13,669

they could still feel sensation

moreover

993
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:49,769
we know what you have a pretty good idea
from the work go abroad vsnl dot com

994
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:53,130
group going on there

995
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,619
i think it was good

diario of the brain that

997
00:46:56,569 --> 00:47:01,689

but it's not just sort of thing

1000
00:47:10,459 --> 00:47:12,679
the request

1001
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:15,039
you know we had to go

1002
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:16,129
you know

1003
00:47:16,129 --> 00:47:19,869
i don't know enough about it would have
to be quite know what what happened

obviously station

1005
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:25,869
i think what

1006
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:28,219
what robert robert woodson

1007
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:32,559
that's under a logical problem we know
what i think i'll that happens because
