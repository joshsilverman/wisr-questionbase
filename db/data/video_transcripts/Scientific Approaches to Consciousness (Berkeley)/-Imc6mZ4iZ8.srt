1
00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:02,060
okay

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:07,820
no no reason not to get started let me
just review the bidding for the exam

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,529
wednesday

4
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:15,069
i think i know all the students who have
disability along accommodations

5
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:19,609
and you should have received and you
know for me about those accommodations

6
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:20,999
before the weekend

7
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:22,269
home so if you

8
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:27,359
think you have a d_s_p_ accommodation
and you didn't get an email for me

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,599
work without the u_s_ rest is up for a
sentence

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,370
on and if you still don't see one

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,020
get in touch with me right away

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,320
so they're going to twenty five short
answer questions i mean really short

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,460
answer question now one word maybe but
no more than three sentences is required

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,320
to answer each question perfectly well

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,450
and that's really over looking for it so
you need to kind of

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,640
get yourself ready to kind of moved
through you examine

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,350
almighty advices

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,040
look through the exam answer the
questions you can answer

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,450
is fast as you can do it

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,470
and then go back at work on the ones
that you're having a little bit more

21
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,470
difficulty

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,370
and that's what a covers all the
material today

23
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,480
both the readings and the gamble
lectures

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,250
i had to make room for some extra
lectures so we'll do endorse the asian

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,119
coma

26
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,590
after thus after spring break

27
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,150
frankly

28
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,940
makes more sense anyway

29
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,560
and there are lots of resources
available we're doing this holiday

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,920
session

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,970

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,210
great exams

35
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,540
that information is on the exam
information page along with all the

36
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,649
other it previous exams and previous
offerings of the scores

37
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:45,899
on and

38
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,710
if you don't get your question answered
today

39
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:54,320
posted to the midterm exam form on the
home topic in new york

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,690
vspace website

41
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:01,600
you do that by noon tomorrow you have an
answer by five o'clock

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,700
lets move through this and they
relatively straightforward fashion okay

43
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,369
on the exam is always focused on general
concepts and principles

44
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,759
i'm not going to ask you to solve the
mind-body problem

45
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,549
okay or something like that

46
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:19,149
i don't think that's an appropriate exam
question it might be fun for a term

47
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:22,389
paper but it's not an appropriate exam
question

48
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:25,519
but you're never going to solve the
mind-body problem unless you understand

49
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,319
the basic concepts and principles that
we're talking about the scores

50
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,809
and so that's where the exam

51
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:34,669
how do you focus

52
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:35,899
bomb

53
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:41,119
all for the introduction introductory
lecture

54
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,149
that's what we talked about

55
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:45,409
more or less what the

56
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:47,749
reading such as they were from robbins
who will

57
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:49,689
all were all about

58
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:52,739
so anything there

59
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:59,739
anybody got a question

60
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:07,619
it's what

61
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:11,279
there's a reason but i'm repeating
because food webcast and i'm not sure if

62
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:13,349
the thus were born picked them up

63
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,040
the puzzle istook reserved that comes
out of the vienna circle but it doesn't

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,180
refer specifically to the vienna circuit

65
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,159
are in fact long before anybody heard of
the vienna circle people like

66
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,239
john b watson were saying

67
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,969
psychology campion saigon science a
mental life because it's it's subjective

68
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:32,489
in science has to be objective

69
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,049
and the guys who kind of fall in the
positive is the reserve are just shy

70
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,599
about consciousness

71
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,329
because they worry about that particular
point

72
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:47,609
home consciousness doesn't seem to refer
to anything

73
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:49,589
in the third person

74
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:51,349
situation

75
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:54,859
that's exactly what it is

76
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,199
anything else about this

77
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:59,889
and consciousness just to say conscious
shyness is a theme that runs through

78
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:01,309
this whole courts

79
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,439
because

80
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,499
consciousness makes

81
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:06,419
some psychologists in cognitive sciences

82
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,419
you can imagine how members are made by
the concept of

83
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,019
unconsciousness

84
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:14,709
not to mention on conscious mental one

85
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:15,980
or when we get to it

86
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,860
later in the course altered states of
consciousness that just drive some

87
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,759
people bananas

88
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:29,759
anything else about the introductory
lectures we can come back to this later

89
00:04:30,059 --> 00:04:32,680
okay then we talked about introspection

90
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,120
what it is that goes on in the mind what
these qualitative std subjective states

91
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,479
of consciousness

92
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,879
are all about

93
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,270
and kind of how they classify them

94
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,210
i talked early on about this idea that

95
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,610
mental contents can be classified into
basically three

96
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,069
different kinds of things cognitions
emotions and motivations

97
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,090
an idea that comes from

98
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,590
well comes from plato but

99
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,970
we get it from cond

100
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,289
and it seems like a pretty good idea

101
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:04,840
although james's introspective analysis
of consciousness

102
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,309
then which there has never been anything
more beautifully done than that

103
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:14,119
what the philosophers worry about when
they introspective things like quality

104
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:18,709
quali oh and dogs are intentionally

105
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:21,490
and then we get to the scientific
approach which

106
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,719
really begins in the nineteenth century
was cycle physics

107
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:26,400
and the general idea that

108
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,550
you can tied mental states too

109
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,020
something objective like stimulus
conditions

110
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,300
or whatever

111
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,039
and then we get to the structural as we
try to figure out what the basic

112
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,280
building blocks

113
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,719
on qualitative experience or

114
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:46,719
any questions about this

115
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,580
yeah the question is

116
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,910
papa bell miller's doctrine of specific
nerve energies but the broader question

117
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,750
is how do we know we've got a mud ality
of sensation how do we know there is

118
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,929
vision and auditioned and got station
and all factions and all of that

119
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:07,740
and you could say well

120
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,509
we get the stimulus release different
sets rima delhi's compro

121
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:14,629
you could say well they come from the
stimulus

122
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:17,139
we see electromagnetic radiation

123
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:18,810
and we hear

124
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,559
palm mechanical vibrations an error and
all of that stuff

125
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:25,350
but it turns out they don't come from
the stimulus to come from the break

126
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,270
they come from the nervous system

127
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,189
and what miller proposed was that eve
sensory modality

128
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:33,220
was associated

129
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,739
a particular set of neural structures

130
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:38,240
and to be

131
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,840
activation

132
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,889
where the passage of a neural impulse
through those particular girl structures

133
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:46,340
all leads us to have vision as opposed
to what dition

134
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,870
go station as opposed to a faction all
or whatever

135
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,789
vote the specific nerve energies isn't

136
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:54,910
really the right

137
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,279
idea i mean

138
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,109
just for the for the history of it

139
00:06:58,109 --> 00:06:58,990
miller thought

140
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,180
that different nerves the auditory nerve
the olfactory nerve whatever

141
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,649
carry different kinds of neural impulses

142
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,029
and that's wrong

143
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:10,790
all nerves contained would carry the
same in polls

144
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,349
on a roll in polls

145
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,449
so he was in right about that but the
name doctrine of specific nerve energies

146
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,819
is come down to was have been preserved

147
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,159
in this idea that every modality of
sensation

148
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:26,080
and for that matter every quality of
sensation within a modality

149
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,249
is associated with a particular neural
pathways

150
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,900
that's what that's all about

151
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:39,900
okay by don't if i don't answer
correctly you've got to let me know

152
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:46,029
the structural has tried to add a y_ is
complex

153
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,809
sensory experiences mostly

154
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:51,829
they worked on a motion to but that most
of the work done sensation

155
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:53,260
into their

156
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,210
fundamental building brought walks

157
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,580
tried to reduce

158
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,200
every conscious

159
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,770
experience

160
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,880
to some relatively small number of
elements

161
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,129
that couldn't be reduced further

162
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:08,250
so for example if i showed you something
purple you'd probably say well i see

163
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,219
some red in there that i see some
bluewin that

164
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:14,219
but if i show you something red you're
going to say

165
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,889
i see red in that

166
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,409
dep any further down then red

167
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,450
and that tells us that read

168
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,709
redness is a basic quality of

169
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:28,239
fish or sensation and that's what
instructions tried to do for tasted

170
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,669
personnel and for all of these

171
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:32,240
uh... all these things

172
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,450
same idea fall inspired

173
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,720
basically all inspired by the try
chromatic theory of color vision which

174
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,880
they didn't get

175
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,589
all the colors of the paint store

176
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:44,530
from just three

177
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,370
make these guys has tried to do it for
anything else

178
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:55,350
without okay

179
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,490
yeah i could do that rebel assault does
it a lot better than i do

180
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,240
all who's got a couple of pages of all
at one of his chapters on that but the

181
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,880
general idea was

182
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,620
the structural iso argued that you could
pick every sensory experience a

183
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,420
decomposing

184
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,200
into its elements

185
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,270
all and that

186
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,270
identifying those elements was
sufficient wonder stand what to send

187
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,600
what what the sensory experience was

188
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,710
and they pushed alters said well wait a
minute

189
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,910
all sensory experience isn't

190
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,580
just decompose the bolt with salomon's
because

191
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,000
what's the quote

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,140
the whole is greater than the sum of its
parts

193
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,470
for the structural issues

194
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,920
the whole is exactly equal to the sum of
its parts

195
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,380
british talked psychologist said there's
something more there is some kind of

196
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,630
inherent organization or these things
relate to each other in particular ways

197
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,760
that lead to have the lead you to have a
percept

198
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,269
that is a really decompose the wall

199
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:51,060
intuit's

200
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,330
in the into its constituent elements

201
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,790
so that's the gestalt us critique fault
structure was on

202
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,600
and the behaviorist had their own
critique of

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,440
of bald

204
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,170
volvo structure was on

205
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,990
which basically began with the idea that
different

206
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,210
structural is laboratories gave somewhat
different results would people

207
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,950
introspective and they said

208
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,470
we can do with us anymore

209
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:17,050
let's just look at reps

210
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,130
anything else

211
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:24,910
ticket

212
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,830
yeah well

213
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,820
probably would be used those terms quite
that way

214
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,480
palm

215
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,410
at those ribbons will does

216
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,330
the idea of causal inertness is really
the most important idea i think and

217
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,679
that's the idea that

218
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,450
concert we make

219
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,980
have consciousness

220
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,520
consciousness doesn't to enter into the
causal scheme of things

221
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,780
and that's because

222
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,160
uh... in the physical sciences alm

223
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,150
fog this the physical universe is a
closed system

224
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,980
all of that you've got a billiard ball

225
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,280
he hit the billiard ball with your with
with reports tech and that goes across

226
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,899
the table and it's all up its legal the
though the edge of the table

227
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,060
and it bounces back and hit some pool

228
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,870
another pool beloved herbal

229
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,769
and send the flyer but around all that's
a closed system

230
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:17,080
anders energy that's being dissipated of
energy that's been

231
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,970
on for the transmitted from one object
to another that's just the way the

232
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,920
physical world operates

233
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,010
home

234
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,520
and all

235
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,090
people have a lot of difficulty figuring
out

236
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,750
how minded

237
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,330
thought all of the hasn't image a real
substance the way gary hart did could

238
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,180
ever possibly under into that

239
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,270
so the physical universe is a closed

240
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,269
causal

241
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,520
universe

242
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,130
it's not open to mental

243
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,850
influences

244
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,270
all of them for that

245
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,330
reason

246
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,540
poem

247
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,610
mind his closet we ever trick of what
you think tab possibly you have any

248
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,500
effect on what goes on in the world

249
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,270
that's the idea

250
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,450
yes so you're probably due to a position
of epa phenomenal ism

251
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,510
all which

252
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,790
there's a philosophical position the
says we have lines we have consciousness

253
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,790
but doesn't do anything

254
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,279
on

255
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,250
thomas huxley use metaphor was those
steam whistle on the locomotive

256
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,470
that it just doesn't make the locomotive
gao

257
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:28,470
flows off steam

258
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:38,710
okay yet gotten to the first part

259
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,010
well perhaps my ideas so let's

260
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,200
not surprisingly didn't get into a
crisis

261
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,170
what then

262
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,570
not when these structural astride two

263
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,610
we've got got their their observers to
introspective

264
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,139
they wanted

265
00:12:56,139 --> 00:13:00,970
observers to describe the qualities of
the sensory experience to which some

266
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,600
stimulus gave rise

267
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,350
so far showed you

268
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,329
up although the failure of the

269
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:07,940
patch of purple

270
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,630
i don't want to say it looks like a plum

271
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,710
that's describing the stimulus

272
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:20,190
all but the structural s wanted people
to do was to describe their experiences

273
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:24,120
also to make the stimulus errors to
describe the stimulus instead of the

274
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,470
sensory experience

275
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,480
sore exposed to say

276
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,680
i see red and icy blue when i see a
little twinge of green there

277
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,790
when you show me this

278
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,750
this purple thing

279
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,380
and

280
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,539
where i think the structural is when a
wrong there was that

281
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:45,140
they trying to strip mental states of
their content

282
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,080
they tried to strip there but the mental
states of there are boldness

283
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,920
if you show me a patch of purple and i
say it looks like a plum

284
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,630
that gives it some intentional content
of refers to something in the world

285
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,410
palm

286
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,439
and james

287
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,970
pointed out

288
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,570
after brent are loaded

289
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,090
mental states are interesting precisely
because they've referred to things in

290
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,170
the world outside the money

291
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,940
they've referred to

292
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,970
they've referred as something other than
themselves was the way james put it

293
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,010
and the structural seemed to me

294
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,520
not get that

295
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,560
they seem to think that mental states
referred just to themselves which is why

296
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,150
they forced or observers not to commit
the stimulus error

297
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,290
i think it's all relatively minor point
it's not his biggest lead critique

298
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,149
the gestalt critique of introspection
that the whole is greater than the soul

299
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:35,470
of sports

300
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,240
and it's probably not as profound as
they

301
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,010
behavior is pretty

302
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,610
but it's more correct

303
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:48,610
than the behavior is pretty as we know
the behaviors for wrong about everything

304
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,090
not as long as freud but they were wrong
about everything

305
00:14:53,090 --> 00:15:00,090
it's hard to be wrong about more than
everything but really managed

306
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,540
you know somebody once pointed out that
the city's wong about everything isn't

307
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,690
that's even worse than chanson

308
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,139
okay anything else about this

309
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:13,960
we can come back to him later

310
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,210
so let's talk about mind-body problem

311
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,680
and its various fault various ways

312
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,450
and he got even though we are trying to
move away from palazzo pro prompt lost

313
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,490
me here

314
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,760
all in our cognitive science anyway an
important role before suppresses to ask

315
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,780
the questions and check the answers

316
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,490
palm so our discussion about the
mind-body problem really has to start

317
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,370
philosophy

318
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,240
eyes it's come down to us from descartes

319
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,050
on and

320
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:46,010
the various ways in which different for
lost furs have tried to deal

321
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,770
with this cartesian distinction between
mind and body

322
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,100
so

323
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,559
on

324
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,389
this isn't of course in the philosophy
of mind so we've already taken that when

325
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,500
you could teach it better than i could

326
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,540
uh... it's not of course in the history
of philosophy but there is a vocabulary

327
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,370
here

328
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,200
different kinds of interact with the
different kinds of volunteer willie's om

329
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,270
and materialism and idealism and all
that

330
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,020
that i want you know

331
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,830
have some familiarity with

332
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,390
but basically all of this gets us to

333
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,490
the great cartesian impasse

334
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,860
the idea that you got my name's and yet
god

335
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,020
and you know that somehow they interact
with each other

336
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,440
but i can't figure out how it could
possibly happen

337
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,800
and image a realist

338
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,209
and image a real substance like the mine

339
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:33,490
could possibly

340
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,000
enter into a causal

341
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,420
a maturing universe

342
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,320
that's the problem

343
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:46,320
anything about this

344
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:52,900
right

345
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,900
go

346
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,200
nobody ever said i got this right

347
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,570
spanos i but i think about span ozone as
adores just because of this position a

348
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,340
property dualism

349
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,780
you seem to think that objects had two
different kinds of properties mental

350
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,440
properties and physical properties that
comes close

351
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,250
to dualism

352
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,430
close enough as they say for government
work

353
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,540
alm

354
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,900
now his brother and that's exactly what
he's trying to strengthen explicit

355
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,240
were all everybody in this room is a
materialist

356
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,840
in the sense that

357
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,080
we believe the role there is a physical
world

358
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,519
but we have to try to

359
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,670
most of us think that anyway

360
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,350
palm

361
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,820
all but uh...

362
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,990
or at least as a sign of scientists were
materialists okay

363
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,900
but still somehow we have to make room
for this thing that doesn't seem to

364
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,799
belong there

365
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,580
and

366
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,440
that kind of shades in the dualism for
me

367
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,910
it's less important that you classify
span ozone as the duelist or a

368
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,809
materialist

369
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:07,390
then it kind of understand what he went
through trying to solve this mind-body

370
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,100
problem

371
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,870
and the than the solution he came up
with

372
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,070
that's what's really important

373
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,530
so i'm never going to ask you a question
that would say here's a list of forty

374
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,580
percent here's

375
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,460
three categories

376
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,870
and slot them one into the other

377
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,420
i wouldn't do that

378
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:31,420
okay

379
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:07,130
biological naturalism

380
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,190
i'm going to answer that question two
ways

381
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,100
first that's a wonderful question to ask
professor sorrell

382
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,020
a someday

383
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,450
what doctor risa dot there's a second
way

384
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,560
and that is

385
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,880
that i think

386
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,150
swirls attempt to grapple with this

387
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,190
is

388
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,560
no different from anybody else's attempt
to grapple

389
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,000
on and that

390
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,440
amid what one of the wanna professor
sarolst felt all philosophical methods

391
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,090
from has earliest work right up until of
the most recent and this is not a

392
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,370
criticism

393
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,000
he tends to cut through received two
categories

394
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,510
quote from strolled someplace it says

395
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,770
whenever

396
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:07,480
philosophical vocabulary seems to uh...
forces to too

397
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,889
completely contrary couple positions

398
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:13,100
there's probably something wrong with
the vocabulary

399
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,380
and he's probably right about that so
what the first thing sural does is to

400
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,060
say

401
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,540
the reason you get into an old list
trouble

402
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:27,500
is because you think about mind and body
as somehow different kinds of things

403
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,730
and he says

404
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,790
let's see what happens if we don't do
that

405
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:37,250
if we think about mind and body as
basically connected in the following way

406
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,210
that binders are causal property all
brains

407
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,690
okay which is basically what he says

408
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,770
somehow

409
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,390
or bar mental states

410
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,609
caused by

411
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:50,169
our brain states

412
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:53,940
and exactly how they receive other
another interest in principle and sales

413
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,890
work itself

414
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,469
also once we figure out that

415
00:20:56,469 --> 00:20:59,359
then we just going to kick the problem
over to the nor a biologist to let them

416
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,970
figure out how how it happens their job
to do that not mine

417
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,200
fall and i think that's also both of the
perfectly reasonable part of the

418
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,789
proposition

419
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:14,910
that will look like the dualism too a
lot of people

420
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,570
fall

421
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,070
but he insists it's not

422
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,410
and the reason he insists it's not is
that he says

423
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,910
i don't

424
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,300
except the fundamental distinction
between body and mind so you can call me

425
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,179
a duelist

426
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:35,820
to other people that will look eurostar
shave off epa phenomenal isn't

427
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,220
yacht well were or reduction as a
benefit that that that's that that's an

428
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,970
interesting impression for people to get
because through insists he's not either

429
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,750
and up a phenomenal list

430
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,210
nor

431
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,630
a production is

432
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:53,500
he believes that mental states are
caused by brain processes

433
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,290
palm

434
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,570
but he believes that

435
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,830
mental states play a causal role in the
world

436
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,480
and he doesn't think you could reduce

437
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,250
mental states

438
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,450
true brain processes

439
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,170
all this to the first one first

440
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,419
though that the second one first you can
reduce

441
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:12,490
mental states to brain processes

442
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,050
because mental state third given off
first-person description

443
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:21,570
i'm in pain i see green are you feel
awful today or whatever

444
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,580
and brain prophesies are something that
can be developed

445
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,170
of third-person description of the
complete description the brain process

446
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,600
so you can reduce mental processes the
brain processes

447
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,250
without leaving something out and if you
have to leave something out

448
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,850
then it's not a successful reduction so
that's his position about that as i

449
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,720
understand it

450
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,630
and sorrow was not a mecca for novelist
because he believes that mental states

451
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,130
play a causal role in the world

452
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,600
in fact his left

453
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,790
two or three books have all been about
how recreate rock a large portion of the

454
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,360
world

455
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,140
through mental activities

456
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,919
so for example

457
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,700
alm

458
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,250
to use his example

459
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,670
this is a dollar bill

460
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,760
because i say it's a dollar bill

461
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,309
or rather this is a dollar bill because
the president says it's a dollar bill or

462
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:13,320
somebody like that says it's a dollar
bill

463
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,580
but it's just a piece of

464
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,890
cloth fibers

465
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,250
you'd objectively

466
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,240
by what sorrel would call inactive
collective intention ality

467
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,410
we'll hold make this into something that
has

468
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,380
that really is there really is a dollar
bill

469
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,230
and had really will buy you a dollar's
worth of peeps over a dollar's worth of

470
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,280
whatever it is becca that you want in
the real world so it's not true that

471
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,730
mental states don't play a causal role

472
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,890
building the visible universe

473
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,030
i've told that's just because there is
hard to pigeonhole but the reason is

474
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:56,180
hard to pigeonhole is because he doesn't
accept this distinction to begin with

475
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,950
my own problem

476
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,660
no he is not a mystery and either

477
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,940
all of the and that he's not a mystery
because he assumes that the norrell

478
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,610
biologists will solve the problem

479
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,560
he says

480
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,780
the neuro biologist will never solve the
problem is if they keep asking the wrong

481
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,100
question

482
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,640
and the wrong question is a question
that's frame by this cartesian dualism

483
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,560
that we somehow have to they have to get
over

484
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,110
my own problem

485
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,230
with full swirls biological naturalism

486
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,110
is that

487
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,620
i'd he doesn't

488
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,250
in my view

489
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,549
alm

490
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:36,250
connect up

491
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,350
the biological naturalism the comes
through with his

492
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,350
critique of

493
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,840
glossing consciousness

494
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,459
with his later

495
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:46,779
form or work on on on these social

496
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:49,179
where the cognitive construction of
reality

497
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:51,230
in this way

498
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,960
if you say as he does

499
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,230
minding his own causal property of
brains

500
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,290
brain processes cause

501
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,470
mental states to work or

502
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,350
that suggests that brain that mental
states are and a fact

503
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,830
a brain processes

504
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,510
and what you really need to do now is to
find some way for that affect now to be

505
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,510
a cause of something

506
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,460
especially

507
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,250
so there's gotta be some dugout although
some mechanism for the states to come

508
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,050
back

509
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,830
into the brain

510
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,070
uh... in uh... in some way

511
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:27,040
and what you do is he'd say well you
know course inform midsole machinery on

512
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,950
it and all that but it uh... it seems to
me he leaves that part of it out

513
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,070
when he's trying to solve

514
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,820
that the this mind-body problem

515
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,260
that's a problem he doesn't want to
leave out exactly because he

516
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,890
but he believes that

517
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:47,890
mental states have

518
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,660
nair

519
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,410
i'd i what i think differ if i said he
was anything other than a biological

520
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:02,610
naturalist i would get really hostile
phone calls from the dark of night

521
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,990
what i don't think he's a friend right

522
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,960
and i don't know i i wouldn't want to
promote a misunderstanding of friends

523
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,020
work

524
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,990
ulm especially my misunderstanding
reference work

525
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,640
sorrel is hard to pigeonhole

526
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,820
okay is just hard to pigeonhole

527
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,040
you've made himself

528
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,620
hard to pigeonhole

529
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,430
and the reason

530
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,450
he he's hard to pigeonhole is

531
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,430
he doesn't want to be in any pigeonhole

532
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:29,649
he doesn't want to be trapped by this
vocabulary that we got

533
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:32,470
guardian the sixteenth century

534
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,850
thong and

535
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,960
can understand that

536
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,940
yahoos it's it's fair

537
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:46,940
anything more on this

538
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,990
functional as a man behavior ism should
seem extraordinarily similar to you

539
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,520
because functional is a misbehavior

540
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,900
they come on a different traditions

541
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,399
palm

542
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:01,549
all food psychological behaviors and
comes out of the animal learning

543
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:02,960
laboratory

544
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,300
philosophical behaviors and really comes
out of the other circled sage aaron and

545
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,470
don't go burrowing owl and uh... and and
and those guys

546
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,140
and functional as i'm really kind of
comes out of the computer metaphor of

547
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,770
the line

548
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:20,200
also they have different rooms but they
though psychological behavior is a man

549
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,290
philosophical behavior as a man

550
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,330
mobile call computational functional ism

551
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,450
fallen uh... really all basically have
the same

552
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,800
underline idea

553
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,100
there are still millis imports

554
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,690
and there are response outputs

555
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,360
and that's really all that matters

556
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,799
poland and yeah i bet that level they're
basically the same

557
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,830
calm

558
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,100
just one of disciples like

559
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,820
talk about this a little bit more
lecture supplements if you've read it

560
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,670
there's another kind of functional isn't

561
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,340
people sometimes get confused with this
cold chicago functional ism

562
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,600
all that it comes to us from people like
uh... angel who was uh...

563
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,350
psychologist of uber secure cardinal
john do we

564
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,920
and for that matter believe james
himself

565
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,870
and our chicago functional ism in
psychology

566
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,960
really is

567
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,850
quite different

568
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:13,169
it's not computational functions with
all the sometimes people get them

569
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:14,600
confused

570
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,840
although chicago functions of the really
good functional

571
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,080
all because it says that the uh... uh...
that bushels of ms predicated on

572
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,830
basically three assertions

573
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,710
first of mind has adapted value

574
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,390
organisms

575
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,090
have minds in use minds to

576
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,080
fallen

577
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,900
to art

578
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,720
facilitate their adaptation to the
environment

579
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,190
palm the second is that fall their goods
will be mind and body

580
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,340
which basically says the mind is what
the brain dot is and sold if you want to

581
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,500
you need to connect what you know what
the mind which commit which no but the

582
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,110
brain

583
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,120
and the third point his mind in action

584
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,989
fault which basically says that

585
00:28:56,989 --> 00:29:01,620
or mental states clauses to behave the
way we do

586
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,490
that's that's just psychology

587
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,420
right that's what that's just what
psychologists believe that when they're

588
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,380
being psychologist

589
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:13,020
palm and it is not susceptible to the
same kind of critique as computational

590
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,420
function was at the kind of
computational cultural ism

591
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,870
you see for example the work done done
it

592
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,570
who basically says there is any puts

593
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,880
and there is no points

594
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,480
and there's this machine in the middle

595
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,320
all about the really important thing is
the imports

596
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,040
and the outputs

597
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:39,040
fallen anything more on this

598
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:42,029
yeah i can do that a little better

599
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:45,170
that's that was a close off in the very
first lecture

600
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:48,280
but basically

601
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,190
the cognitive revolution

602
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,080
palm trees

603
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,070
laid the foundation for revival of
interest in consciousness but from what

604
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,309
the tension

605
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:58,910
and short term memory and imagery and
all of that kind of stuff

606
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,200
but at the same time

607
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,570
this major guardians the cog revolution
noam chomsky basically said

608
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,250
language

609
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,860
and for him

610
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,530
is mediated by syntactic across the seas
of which we have absolute no conscious

611
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,350
awareness

612
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,350
and canot only by

613
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,790
so in that sense

614
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,800
chomsky in linguistics kind of
undermines

615
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,539
calm

616
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:24,820
saw

617
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,720
the the the interesting consciousness

618
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,520
by suggesting that all the action really
is on conscience

619
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,100
and so that we can't know

620
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,429
to accept or

621
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:38,170
except indirectly so that that's really
all that sort

622
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,299
that's what that's all about

623
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:41,880
let's go to another one here

624
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,910
c worrying to next

625
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,789
okay i think we did this

626
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:49,040
anybody have anything more about

627
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:56,040
these guys reduction is a amid all that
kind of stuff

628
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,860
now this is the position interfere
reddick reduction is a missile position

629
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,380
described to pull and patricia church
one

630
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,720
uh... uh...

631
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,769
of who fall off with

632
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:09,060
now call themselves liberal philosophers

633
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,670
and basically they say

634
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,999
the there

635
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:13,120
they're kind of

636
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,790
for publication position is that

637
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,530
they favor a kind of reduction is in the
take stereo that called theoretical

638
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,570
principles of one domain

639
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:25,700
and connect sympathy radical principles
in another domain

640
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,030
so you take

641
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,720
dog disregard period the psychological
level of analysis

642
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,330
and what you want to do is reduce that
to a theory

643
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:37,950
at the biological level of analysis

644
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,760
what the brain is doing

645
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,520
when the mind is performing some kind of
activity

646
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,350
now that they did self is no problem
that's how we connect up psychology the

647
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,440
narrow site

648
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,880
okayed by connecting

649
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,920
theoretical constructs of the
psychological level of analysis to

650
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,070
theoretical constructs

651
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,289
at the

652
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,470
biological level of analysis

653
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:00,150
where the church ones

654
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,140
goal wrong i think

655
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,900
isn't thinking that

656
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,730
more scientific

657
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:11,560
somehow to substitute the biological
vocabulary and the biological concepts

658
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,600
for the psychological concepts

659
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,220
the church ones do a right

660
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,570
mantle of the dog got our our mental
constructs

661
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,310
i believe i feel i'd want

662
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:27,660
all of that are kind of folks psychology
that comes from your grandmother

663
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,820
fall grandmother psychology that
sometimes called

664
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,110
on and that if you're if we're really
going to be scientists

665
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,229
what we would talk about instead is

666
00:32:36,229 --> 00:32:39,869
neuro transmitters and sin taxes and
hormones an oxy posted on all of that

667
00:32:39,869 --> 00:32:41,090
kind of stuff

668
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,259
and they've gone so far is to say

669
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,130
that psychological theory

670
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,739
ought to be grounded in

671
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:47,840
the quote is

672
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,470
our real-world the findings of
neuroscience

673
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,150
implying that somehow

674
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,700
what psychologist who was not attached
to the real world

675
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,800
fault and suggesting that

676
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,780
mentalist a constructs like

677
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,750
thoughts and beliefs and feelings and
desires

678
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,390
caught have no more

679
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:15,390
onto logical status no more existence
than easter and largest on unfair res

680
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,409
don't think that's right

681
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:22,540
mean it's not it's not only not a nice
position

682
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,430
fall but it's completely wrong

683
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,500
and the reason it's completely rwanda's

684
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,789
yet although understand what the brain
is due in until you understand what's

685
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:33,190
going on at the mental level of analysis

686
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:36,260
to cap possibly understand

687
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,670
hull mind and brain contact

688
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:42,130
unless you have a proper description of
mental life at the psychological level

689
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,780
of analysis first

690
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,419
if you don't have that

691
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,800
that all you've got is

692
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,169
sparks and

693
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:51,030
trips at the syntax

694
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,630
for which is flying norrell biology but
it doesn't tell you anything about what

695
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,020
it does

696
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,910
or in terms of uh... in terms of the boy

697
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,179
all i'd prefer to reverse the churchill
and the addictive

698
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:07,970
and ground and neurobiology in the real
world findings in psychology

699
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:14,449
or that seems to be a were logical place
to go

700
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:17,019
that that diatribe

701
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:17,480
home

702
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:24,480
were about this

703
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:32,980
yeah

704
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,980
well but one of the criticisms of
chalmers i think is that you don't

705
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,989
really get what he's saying in the first
place

706
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:43,840
palm because he seems to be taking to
quite different positions first is

707
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,890
he seems to embrace dualism because he
says mind is real limits there in its

708
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,629
third and uh... and and and and all of
that

709
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:54,580
but he seems to say that somehow

710
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,039
wind balm is a property of

711
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:58,980
of a mission

712
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,339
of a computational machine

713
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:03,439
and hollow you can

714
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,219
do that

715
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:05,769
how you can get that

716
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:11,450
is not easy to do and chalmers does it
with what the old greeks would call that

717
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,950
in my view anyway

718
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,730
dusted with a day is x

719
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,579
national

720
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:17,840
god comes out of the rafters

721
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,259
home swung on oakland on a machine

722
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:24,200
employing stone of the greek theater
stage in kind of explains everything

723
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,849
poem

724
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:26,390
and that's what i think happens

725
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,569
when chalmers says well

726
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:34,950
i'm gonna postulate that experience is a
fundamental feature called

727
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,499
it's not just space and time

728
00:35:37,499 --> 00:35:40,589
all that and and and and all that
experience is also a fundamental feature

729
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:41,989
of matter

730
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:43,210
and that

731
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:49,789
experience columnist with any physical
system that embodies information

732
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:52,670
more a physical system embodies
information

733
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,059
the more experience

734
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,399
it has

735
00:35:55,399 --> 00:36:00,589
so we've got brains with a hundred
billion or on his own about andrea bill

736
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:02,230
digo does ileum

737
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,309
connections between of these morons

738
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:08,289
we process a lot of of lot of
information so

739
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:09,240
have a lot of

740
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,679
mental states

741
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,309
your thermostat processes information

742
00:36:14,309 --> 00:36:18,159
and so it's got a mental state and the
solar system can be thought of as an

743
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,339
informational system

744
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:22,279
and so it's got mental states and

745
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:25,669
anything safety kinda gets to this
parents like ism

746
00:36:25,669 --> 00:36:29,059
you think you can possibly mean that

747
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:31,039
but he does mean that

748
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,269
fallen and he doesn't then and he has to
mean that because

749
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:35,939
he's trapped

750
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:37,440
while you do this

751
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,980
solution to the mind-body problem which
is the postulate experience is a

752
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,659
fundamental feature of the universe

753
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:47,380
fall

754
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,279
and that's it

755
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:51,619
really right

756
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:55,239
i don't think there is anything else

757
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,380
palm

758
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,160
are could be wrong about this flood

759
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,529
i've read the book a couple times i've
heard uncork a couple times

760
00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:05,939
i really liked is on the page on the web

761
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:08,269
you've got a great zombie page on the
web

762
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:13,539
uh... everything you'd ever want to no
one's own means is on that page

763
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:17,060
because it takes us on the argument
seriously remembered is really

764
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,660
really interested in

765
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,640
what it would be what the difference
what makes a difference between our

766
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,519
behaving system that's conscious of the
behavior system is not conscious

767
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,839
when i retire really think that's it

768
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:32,729
fall and it doesn't fit the dose doesn't
hang together for me

769
00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:36,759
uh... it may hang together for some for
somebody else who swore driven on but it

770
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:43,759
doesn't hang together for me

771
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:54,619
perot for my purposes here

772
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:56,259
nostril dawson of course believe that

773
00:37:56,259 --> 00:38:00,349
uh... that's the wide why does he look
like it i think is the question

774
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:00,949
okay so

775
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:03,559
if you know why you looks like one that
you know

776
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:07,259
olympic some important features in
salisbury

777
00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:10,430
let's go to something else here

778
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,519
then we did the four mind-body problems

779
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:14,619
palm

780
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:17,409
most cognitive science focuses on the
first two

781
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:19,899
how you can get mines on the bodies

782
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:21,890
and to a lesser extent

783
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,469
all hulled mine skin effect bodies

784
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,389
all right thank also relevant

785
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:27,140
especially

786
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,289
when we start we start off if we have to
as we have to start off

787
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:34,379
cartesian dualism just for the sake of
history

788
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,749
alba dot ask questions about what he did
our bodies without lines

789
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,890
that's the zombie problem

790
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,610
palm

791
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,520
and whether you can have mine too dot
bodies that's the problem of

792
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,379
parapsychology

793
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:48,160
said basically all i have to say about
parapsychology

794
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,700
but those on the argument comes back the
reason i do this will blast in these

795
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,400
lectures

796
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,180
is because

797
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,299
there's a clear connection to

798
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,539
the concept of autumn it has to be

799
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:00,419
and to the autumn it has to be
juggernaut

800
00:39:00,419 --> 00:39:02,789
because the the argument

801
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:04,299
by the proponents

802
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:07,529
the writers on the autumn it has to be
juggernaut is basically that were

803
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:08,919
conscious armies

804
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:10,559
that we have mental states

805
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,670
but these mental states played no role

806
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:15,220
in our behavior because

807
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,199
stimulus is connected to responds

808
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,019
automatically

809
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:22,009
so now we've got

810
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:24,079
really upon the holy marriage

811
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,799
between

812
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:29,450
psychological behavior as a
philosophical dickerson

813
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,630
computational punctual ism

814
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,930
and a lot of a dissident

815
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,969
all them believe

816
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:36,079
that basically all we've got is stimulus

817
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,789
and response

818
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:43,549
and i say the hell with it

819
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:47,009
but that's not enough just to trade to
say that all of it so that's important

820
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,229
to understand

821
00:39:48,229 --> 00:39:49,030
why

822
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,650
the argument doesn't work

823
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,529
and the argument doesn't work because

824
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:58,890
the bad people or argument that these
social behavior is all automatic

825
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,780
haven't actually done the experiments

826
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:05,039
the tears apart the contribution of
automatic and controlled processing

827
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,230
and when you do that using something
like two colby's processed association

828
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,309
uh... technique it doesn't turn out that
way

829
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:12,980
all

830
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,669
it turns out that

831
00:40:15,669 --> 00:40:20,919
past performance reflects off a mix of
conscious and unconscious processing

832
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:25,349
and all the there may be circumstances
under which ka unconscious processing

833
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:29,589
automatic processing dominates those art
generally the circumstances that we

834
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:33,640
encounter revealed ordinary course of
everyday living

835
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,999
fall

836
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,400
and if you don't believe me

837
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,469
wait until thursday night when somebody
asks you won't for friday night

838
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:47,469
don't just say yes or no usaid let me
think about it for a second

839
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,099
and if you don't you wish you had

840
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:54,759
okay anything else about

841
00:40:54,759 --> 00:40:58,589
the these topics

842
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,289
moving right along

843
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:03,099
okay attention

844
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:06,979
early fpo early yang the

845
00:41:06,979 --> 00:41:09,770
versus late processing carries a lot of
attention

846
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:13,239
all of this has to do with where
semantic analysis takes place

847
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:16,589
and whether you can have semantic
analysis before you pay attention to

848
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:17,899
something or not

849
00:41:17,899 --> 00:41:20,489
all and you underlying question is

850
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:22,890
how much can you do pre consciously

851
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,429
how much processing can you do

852
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:32,429
pain conscious attention

853
00:41:34,779 --> 00:41:36,409
so we get

854
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:37,050
arguments for

855
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:39,419
the automata city

856
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:43,290
of of uh... for autumn officially you
can do a lot of pre conscious processing

857
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,990
you could do a lot of processing pre
attentively outside the focus of

858
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,869
attention

859
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:52,529
so long as they are processing has been
automatons either cause its innately

860
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:53,180
automatic

861
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:57,639
or because it's become automata i threw
a lot of experience

862
00:41:57,639 --> 00:42:01,609
most of you when you type you don't say
oh let's see where is for tea

863
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:03,319
and wears a q

864
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:07,689
and all the ease some place or that you
just tight

865
00:42:07,689 --> 00:42:10,039
and for that matter those of you who
tracks

866
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:13,859
have learned to do it not just was not
just with ten digits on a

867
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:16,499
but you learn to do with two phones

868
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:21,469
and you're not thinking about it you can
do with the dark

869
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:24,389
but you learned that suspects a skill
that you learn

870
00:42:24,389 --> 00:42:26,709
and so you can get from your meaning

871
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:27,650
to the message

872
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:34,650
to the phones automatically

873
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:40,410
okay well the process

874
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:44,449
ppm the context of this questions for
processed association procedure

875
00:42:44,449 --> 00:42:48,509
and the process association procedure is
simply

876
00:42:48,509 --> 00:42:50,069
uh... paradigm

877
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:52,220
that allows you to separate out

878
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,349
the contributions of automatic

879
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:57,699
and controlled processing to past
performance

880
00:42:57,699 --> 00:42:59,880
and again i don't expected

881
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,440
get involved in the equations or
anything like that

882
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,400
although if you really get interested in
that you can follow the argument through

883
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,160
in the lecture supplements

884
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,679
but basically that

885
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:12,559
the processed association procedure is
away for figure out

886
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:15,689
how will automatically been is

887
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:16,359
alone

888
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:20,159
and when you do that in the social
domain anyway you find out

889
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,299
stuff is not very automatic appeal

890
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:29,420
so that's the connection

891
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:33,430
yeah that's their debts or early dot
sample from jacoby is work about how you

892
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,390
could use

893
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:37,600
the processed association procedure to
tease apart

894
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,219
the automatic and controlled
contributions

895
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:43,139
the contributions of automatic in
control processing

896
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:44,669
to recognition

897
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:48,729
uh... memory

898
00:43:48,729 --> 00:43:51,439
and again if you want to if you want to
work for that example the bath over

899
00:43:51,439 --> 00:43:52,450
something like that it's

900
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:59,450
it's an electrical

901
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:22,089
doesn't last very long

902
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:38,410
you have a subliminal mere exposure
affects

903
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,650
yeah out that affect us less but you
can't be a good indian end on the merits

904
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,319
washer affect you get bigger fax

905
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,789
supposed especially if they re

906
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:49,210
presentation of the of those shapes for
example is

907
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:49,819
super liberal

908
00:44:49,819 --> 00:44:52,969
is actually in consciousness

909
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:56,109
student gets subliminal mirror exposure
affects but they don't last that even

910
00:44:56,109 --> 00:45:00,109
they don't last very long

911
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:00,869
phone

912
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:05,709
so there are a part of the durham
limitations on that processing as well

913
00:45:05,709 --> 00:45:09,959
the more sublingual the process of the
more the the more subliminal the

914
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:12,019
stimulus the less you can do with it

915
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:19,019
uh... that's the general rule

916
00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:37,889
right know that that that that's exactly
right so for example

917
00:45:37,889 --> 00:45:42,439
let's kind of work out a little chain
here your subliminally exposed to the

918
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:45,130
face of someone

919
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,209
all you don't notice that that that the
face at all

920
00:45:48,209 --> 00:45:50,019
but then in the past

921
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:53,999
you're exposed in conscious awareness to
that face of the new facing arrest which

922
00:45:53,999 --> 00:45:55,299
one you like better

923
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:56,490
you say i like this one

924
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:01,309
the one you happen to have been shown
subliminally one oh that's our conscious

925
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:04,659
and you've already got of them
association between that face and

926
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:05,739
something you like

927
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:08,509
and that's going to carry on later on

928
00:46:08,509 --> 00:46:13,219
so that

929
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:15,310
exactly it could be a big could do that

930
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:16,660
it could do that

931
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,139
all but that

932
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:22,859
does the interval of time between the
sub little exposure and the first

933
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:26,929
conscious exposures public still going
to be relatively short

934
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:28,849
still relatively short

935
00:46:28,849 --> 00:46:29,429
alm

936
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:34,179
the best example of this i know is so it
is all there's a study by your own on it

937
00:46:34,179 --> 00:46:36,679
for the guy named born stain

938
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:39,209
paul who actually is

939
00:46:39,209 --> 00:46:42,739
subliminally expose people as the
subjects the faces of people that they

940
00:46:42,739 --> 00:46:44,839
would later on

941
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:47,729
work within an experiment

942
00:46:47,729 --> 00:46:50,419
and he found that they actually were
nicer

943
00:46:50,419 --> 00:46:53,890
to the people whose faces they ads been
subliminally exposed to

944
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:56,919
but even now dole went to london uk

945
00:46:56,919 --> 00:46:58,979
over duration fifty minutes

946
00:46:58,979 --> 00:47:01,139
experimental period

947
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:03,869
yet the technical term

948
00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:05,859
palm

949
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:06,409
wildcards

950
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:09,059
i think it's not all have to say about
that

951
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:13,059
and demagogued this business about
implicit memory and it was a perception

952
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:15,859
and all of that

953
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:19,739
automatic process ease are unconscious
processes

954
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:23,519
but the general idea behind automat this
city is an automatically passes he's

955
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,029
still generate conscious memories
conscious percept conscious thoughts

956
00:47:28,029 --> 00:47:30,909
conscious feelings conscious motives

957
00:47:30,909 --> 00:47:32,579
and beall

958
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:36,640
beall brand of the lectures on the
explicit in the implicit

959
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,919
called is that

960
00:47:38,919 --> 00:47:41,759
the idea of unconscious percept

961
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:45,749
fidgeting about percept or
representation of a stimulus that

962
00:47:45,749 --> 00:47:49,190
influences your behavior even though
you're not aware of that

963
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:50,999
representation

964
00:47:50,999 --> 00:47:55,419
looks to be viable there's something
like unconscious mental states

965
00:47:55,419 --> 00:48:01,449
states are about something there about
the stimulus there about the past

966
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:02,679
or whatever

967
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,449
and that's so

968
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:05,809
kind of where we are

969
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:09,539
we're going to use this implicit
explicit distinction in the second half

970
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:10,759
of the course

971
00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:13,269
when we talk about

972
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:15,989
information processing can you do when
you're asleep or when you're an

973
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:16,850
anesthesia

974
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:20,579
or you r_u_ processing anything when
you're in a coma

975
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:21,539
stuff like that

976
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:24,819
so we're going public

977
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,559
over dot time maybe for one or two more
questions

978
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:30,699
if i didn't get to your question of
something pops up to you as soon as you

979
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,660
leave the building today

980
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,910
just type it in to the forum you do that
by noon tomorrow you get a response for

981
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:43,910
me by five o'clock

982
00:48:43,919 --> 00:48:45,349
alm

983
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:48,849
explicit implicit memory can be
dissociated in two different ways first

984
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:52,399
our populations of people like and music
patients

985
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:57,779
who don't have explicit memory but do
have implicit memory

986
00:48:57,779 --> 00:49:01,509
exposing them to the memory can be
dissociated bite

987
00:49:01,509 --> 00:49:03,669
compared to the republicans of people

988
00:49:03,669 --> 00:49:07,650
then there are the functional
dissociation

989
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,729
different experimental manipulations

990
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:12,559
candace sociated explicit an implicit
memory

991
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,539
so for example level processing at the
time of encoding

992
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:18,930
has a big affect on explicit memory

993
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:22,079
but has relatively little effect on the
implicit memory

994
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:29,079
so that's sort of the war another way in
which they could be dissociated

995
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,900
and the same thing goes for perception
and the same thing goes for all these

996
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,769
other

997
00:49:35,769 --> 00:49:36,729
domains as well

998
00:49:36,729 --> 00:49:38,759
so we're always looking for us

999
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:40,859
ways in which we can split apart

1000
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:42,909
or just so she ate

1001
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:47,410
conscious x promo unconscious x directs
refers to

1002
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,089
some mental state perception

1003
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:52,389
memory thinking

1004
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,809
learning knowledge

1005
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:59,799
emotion motivation or whatever

1006
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:01,779
okay thank you very much

1007
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:03,669
will see you on the forum we'll see you
on wednesday
