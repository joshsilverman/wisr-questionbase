1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,040
appl

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,340
okay

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,859
palm let's finish up our discussion of
the explicit implicit distinction

4
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:12,070
fight turning our attention from

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,939
explicit

6
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:14,819
cognitions watchful so the motion

7
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:16,529
but first

8
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:17,269
alm

9
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:20,259
a word about the uh... about the exam
remember regatta

10
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:22,539
our midterm exam is next wednesday

11
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,230
so you can go off for spring break and
not be thinking about it

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,009
will do well i think let's review on
monday the fourteenth

13
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:31,929
alm i've received over

14
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:35,810
about half dozen d_s_p_ accommodations
homeowners

15
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,250
and just yesterday i got called

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,820
information about the d_s_p_
accommodation

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,110
for the exam

18
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,620
those who have d_s_p_ accommodations

19
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,380
also into that stuff in the email
probably today

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,570
also the exams going to cover everything
that we've done

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,880
called the since the since the beginning

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,789
it's going to have twenty-five short
answer questions on it

23
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:00,670
and i really mean short answer

24
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,269
now one word necessarily but each one of
the questions can be completely

25
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,850
perfectly answer in just three sentences

26
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,830
or perhaps less

27
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,770
also

28
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,070
got a couple other material

29
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,500
don't want to give you a multiple-choice
exam

30
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,040
you probably don't want a
multiple-choice exam either

31
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,689
all bob we want to make sure that these
exams can be

32
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:22,750
fairly objectively scored

33
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,670
on the reliably scored so that's what
we're doing short answer

34
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,110
and ulm there's a lot of the jury also

35
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,250
there have to be after a number of
questions

36
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,770
lots of resources for the exam on board
is sent to all gordy posted to the

37
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,209
website the narrative review that kind
of

38
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,330
covers the high points or if you will
beable points

39
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,220
on something so far

40
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,750
will do all follow-ups u_n_ a session on
monday

41
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,610
i'm not good at

42
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,880
lecturer or draw recover that narrative
review on monday i'm just going to be

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,480
here

44
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,460
how to uh... to take any questions you
have

45
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,010
there are a lot of materials on the
course website

46
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,950
all the old lecturer was trations

47
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,090
although all the electoral stringent
drop there

48
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,790
their electricity elements that go into
things in more detail

49
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,940
all of the exam information page on the
website the hotels you

50
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,420
poet constructed grade

51
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,879
on exams and courses like this

52
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,750
all also

53
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,620
of on his you went to war the
prestigious

54
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,840
use in this course along with the story
of the scoring guide that i've developed

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,639
for the

56
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,650
for the geo spies

57
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,619
and finally if you don't get your
questions answered on monday

58
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:31,789
home

59
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:37,329
you should uh... post any questions
about the exam to be space or

60
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:41,579
and uh... if you do that by noon on
tuesday

61
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,339
began with the

62
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:43,940
to get a response from me

63
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,439
by five o'clock by the close of business

64
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,429
so that's left

65
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:49,999
and

66
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:51,760
well that's right

67
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,199
on any quick questions about

68
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,909
format of the exam the coverage of the
exam

69
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,589
i think it's all pretty clear

70
00:02:57,589 --> 00:03:02,159
if you look at the past exams you'll see
what kinds of things i'm looking for

71
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,519
that's one of

72
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,409
so far in the series of lectures we've
talked about unconscious cognitive

73
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:11,260
fall

74
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,150
part or the formal unconscious kardasian

75
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,319
the autumn of two city of thought
process these are the prospects for

76
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,899
unconscious memory and perception and
thinking and so on

77
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:24,059
and that raises the question

78
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,330
what else is there

79
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,829
when we talk about unconscious on the
mental states

80
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,989
all it's a good question because
remember that

81
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:35,390
homes as well manual contras all over
the argued

82
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,400
all there's more

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,299
to what goes on in the mind of ben
cognition

84
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,329
there are three absolutely irreducible
faculties of mine

85
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:45,249
knowledge viewing the desire

86
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:50,079
the last three letters we've talked
mostly about unconscious knowledge

87
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,209
now what we won't want to talk about

88
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,239
qualities the motion and motivation when
you have plug consciously motion

89
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,030
and on conscious motivation

90
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,939
in the same way that it but it appears
to be the case

91
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:07,309
that we got a unconscious on cognition

92
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:11,899
okay sult now were treading into
psychoanalytic territory

93
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:12,969
all here

94
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:17,959
all there was freud of who owned that
made the strongest case for unconscious

95
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,530
feelings that affects

96
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,430
flight as i pointed out before freud
himself did not use the iceberg metaphor

97
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,020
but it's or somethin

98
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,250
the metaphor there always comes up in
the alone

99
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,499
in discussions of psychoanalytic theory

100
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:34,359
the general idea of behind all of the
freudian psychoanalysis

101
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:37,129
is that our conscious mental states

102
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:39,500
all var dark conscious behaviors

103
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,659
or the product of one conscious
determines

104
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:46,389
and freud characterize these unconscious
determinants in as

105
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,289
primitive affects all proponent of
sexual and aggressive drives

106
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:53,039
all or calm

107
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,349
of defenses that are on the phone but
better deployed against

108
00:04:58,349 --> 00:04:59,500
against these drives

109
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,899
in order to avoid

110
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:05,130
and in order to avoid home

111
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,189
anxiety

112
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:07,050
and

113
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,559
dried invented psychoanalysis which he
told it is a technique

114
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,030
that that allows people to

115
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,700
become aware of their true feelings

116
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,190
ordered they're they're they're true
drives

117
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,100
the real reasons why they do the things
they do

118
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,150
on getting gain insight into their own
their true feelings and desires

119
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,979
that white at

120
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,289
lawyer consciously

121
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,299
all of the iceberg

122
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,999
well-lit unconsciously at the root of
our homes of our conscious experiences

123
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:38,079
and behaviors

124
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,249
now that's really all i won't say about

125
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:42,690
psychoanalysis just a kind of

126
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,580
all pick knowledge that there is that
what you see

127
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,379
will skip over this

128
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:49,960
analysis of the freudian defense
mechanisms

129
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,960
forgot time all connected with later

130
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,409
all what i want to do in this watchers
having

131
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,460
debian

132
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,029
are you turn live in boulder freudian
ism which is what mostly

133
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,129
but we do

134
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:04,090
all or even the serious uh... for unisom

135
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,610
and the reason for that is

136
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,530
in my view anyway home

137
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,610
when you talk about the unconscious

138
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,800
offered in theory just doesn't get you
anywhere at all

139
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,379
it turns out that after a hundred years

140
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,210
all volvo vault

141
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,300
of clinical experimental research

142
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,319
there just isn't any evidence for any
specific proposition

143
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,629
in classic psychoanalytic theory

144
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:30,349
and in fact some floss is a science
argue the psychoanalytic theory is

145
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,690
completely on testable

146
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:36,269
on because of the way that simply
because of the way itself it's framed

147
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:40,199
and for that matter there is no evidence
of psychoanalysis is a particularly

148
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,439
effective form of psychotherapy you
think of

149
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,009
psychedelic period of the mind was right

150
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,870
that psychoanalytic theory

151
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,369
bogdan psychoanalytic therapy would work

152
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,139
all but there's no evidence of
psychoanalysis

153
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,979
works any better than any other

154
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:55,780
or form

155
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,849
volvo of psychotherapy

156
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,720
instead what i want to do is to talk
about

157
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,509
the idea of on conscious emotion and
unconscious motivation

158
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,319
all

159
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,309
within the context of

160
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:13,369
something we got we know that's actually
true all of the establish psychological

161
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:15,330
theory

162
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,069
and dog

163
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,879
that that at that has really two aspects
to it

164
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,840
all first

165
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,790
it turns out that sold more emotional
and motivational states

166
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,830
are reflections

167
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,250
contradicts all of our consciously
motion

168
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:28,839
emotional

169
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,249
and motivational states are reflections
of unconscious cognition i'll give you a

170
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:34,699
good example of that

171
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,529
on you know the in a second

172
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:39,150
but then further and more interestingly

173
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,050
although there are some theorists out
there all of these days researchers on

174
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,219
not just their risk

175
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:46,340
who are met on making claims that

176
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,660
well there are actually

177
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,970
on conscious motivational and emotional
states

178
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,279
that guide

179
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,159
or experience for and action

180
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,419
all first

181
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:01,760
all with doubly gotta say just to kind
of touch base here

182
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,390
there are certainly some

183
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,159
the emotional states and so on the home

184
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,620
taught us all motivational states

185
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,719
that are automatically activated and
we've known this call for a long time

186
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:19,050
clearest example i think there are the
processes involved in home you'll static

187
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,520
regulation wonder why in things like
longer

188
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,189
and first those are

189
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:26,340
mental state star of the bulls are
motivational states

190
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,450
and we know that hunger is related to of
the body's attempt to regulate job

191
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,850
problem levels hopeful blood sugars

192
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:39,470
and we know that thirst israel is
related to the body's attempt to

193
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,960
regulate undersell fluids

194
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,380
and all

195
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,230
jerry didn't see a show in town

196
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,110
argued that there was a whole category
of sensation that he called intro

197
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,050
ception

198
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,009
all which

199
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:52,390
is sensitive to

200
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,800
levels the blood sugars and all that all
of the cell fluids and body temperature

201
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,490
and things like that

202
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,270
are and then instigate behaviors all the
various kinds of

203
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,430
all bottle lee and all that and
behavioral responses better intended to

204
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,540
restore

205
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,500
all blood sugar levels are so fluid
levels further

206
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,130
for their own

207
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,640
today were wrong

208
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,620
appropriate levels

209
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,460
the or the person to be said about this
is that all of that goes on

210
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,940
automatically

211
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,670
you don't have any conscious accidental
meter in their head that reads out your

212
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,060
blood sugar level you don't save
yourself

213
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,880
on as noon is approaching

214
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,749
all my blood sugar level is dropping

215
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:35,449
are you know i i gotta go

216
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,259
need to go and get a hamburger and our
something like that they don't do

217
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:39,620
anything like that at all

218
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,870
you're just feel hungry

219
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,020
brea feel thirsty and uh... old the
whole

220
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,650
breast with this kind of generated
automatically

221
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:52,799
the other volvo aspect of all that early
aspect of autumn it is to be

222
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,980
has to do with

223
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,050
armed thug

224
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,800
will be cannons classic

225
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,830
flight or flight response to threats
stimuli

226
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,920
and again what cargo cabin argued was
that

227
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,690
on one of our parker kind of in a tree

228
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,240
flecks of response to stimulation wanted
to uh... pregunta threat

229
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,330
was either an emotional state of

230
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,120
fear

231
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,780
or an emotional state

232
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,750
called anger

233
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,440
so here you have nice basic sample even
as early as nineteen fifteen when cannon

234
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,760
wrote his book

235
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,350
all on somebody talking about automatic
unconscious all activation all conscious

236
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,550
so of conscious mental states

237
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,129
art harris or something more recent it
has to do with the effect of paul paul

238
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:41,370
all peoples salt a bit exposure on under
on preferences

239
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,050
this is work that's caught in every
social psychology class so those who've

240
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,500
taken psychology one sixty will know
something about this

241
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,720
this is work by robert zion so-called
late robertson

242
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,700
mostly of michigan all prevented
whiskers at stanford

243
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,320
and science conducted all the following
experiment he brought subjects into the

244
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,710
laboratory

245
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,760
palm end of the ford experiment on
language learning

246
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,059
already said word what we're going to do
is we're going to teach at a pronounce

247
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:13,190
all all the words of a foreign language

248
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,420
and either so words were presented as
turkish words

249
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,770
or they were presented in the form of
jonah chinese idia grass not a word to

250
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,750
actually turkish words and they weren't
actually chinese idia graphs

251
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,949
but the stub subjects in the south study
didn't know any different because they

252
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:32,360
didn't know anything about turkish o or
chinese

253
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,980
all but what those lines did was to
arrange subjects that have

254
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,810
home with a big big see that the turkish
word of his see the chinese to be a

255
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,720
graph

256
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,300
and then they'd go board to pronounce it
in there

257
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,700
you'd don't do the word reviewed a graph
would be repeated

258
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,700
all for a number of trials up to
twenty-five on trial

259
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,399
that's all that it

260
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,740
in the expert except at the end

261
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,670
when dolls i instead of well it turns
out

262
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:02,760
that all of these words in easily graphs
were all artwork world padgett kids

263
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,840
and we don't just like you to guess

264
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,600
all-weather all of the adjective is a
positive thing a positive property palm

265
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,449
oh or a negative

266
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:13,690
property of

267
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,750
of the uh...

268
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,010
of the stimulus

269
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,910
and the results of the experiment

270
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,420
you're just so you can see

271
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,870
these are the pseudo chinese idia graphs
they're not real chuck venue

272
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,750
read chinese

273
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,920
you won't be able to read these

274
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,310
poems and these are the arm

275
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,259
wants to go traditional words

276
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,070
they kinda look like turkish if you
don't know anything about turkish

277
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,010
poem

278
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,250
and one half what what happened here

279
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,050
was that

280
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,369
on science presented some of these
stimuli

281
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:44,400
or a large number of times

282
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,040
and other stimuli just a few times and
it turned out

283
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,190
that when the when the stimulus

284
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,240
had been presented for a large
relatively large number of times

285
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,129
what relatively large number twelve
subjects were more likely to

286
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:01,530
uh... say that it implied a good
birthday

287
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,049
statewide the stimulus

288
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:07,439
all more than they did all if it'd been
we've been presented for only

289
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:08,399
hello

290
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,110
frequency presentations

291
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,950
here is ok lee nice example of this
whether you're looking at pseudo turkish

292
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,820
ur pseudo chinese

293
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,940
this is their home

294
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,390
evaluation zero two six k love goodness

295
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,870
the uh... word was entirely unfamiliar

296
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,670
tended to be

297
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,220
rated as a bad word

298
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,240
if the word was very familiar

299
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,310
it tended to be rated as a good word

300
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,080
and that's a significant defect

301
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,620
and that is what's known as the mere
exposure affect

302
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,080
merely exposing somebody's something

303
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,810
tends to

304
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,270
get them to like it

305
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,859
to preferring we don't like unfamiliar
things we tend to like

306
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,290
familiar things

307
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,010
and

308
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,460
uh...

309
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,300
part

310
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,610
the opinion social psychology the
importance of this

311
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,550
is that this exposure is what we've hold
up your situational effect

312
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,079
on

313
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:01,430
that is there's just something about the
situation

314
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,180
whether you've been exposed to something
or not that leads to the like of that

315
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,730
thing

316
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,690
or not and the general of the general
explanation here

317
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,609
is that repeated exposure

318
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:15,289
ought to a stimulus increases are
familiarity with the stimulus

319
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,970
familiarity increases likability

320
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,679
ald

321
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:22,599
and uh... that just shows you that your
grandmother was wrong

322
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:27,079
familie ready doesn't breed contempt
familiarity all breeds liking

323
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,580
uh... we prefer that

324
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,020
kcal with which we're familiar

325
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,360
now while i talk about this i'm talking
about this

326
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,069
welcome cape

327
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:37,680
it's not just turkish in chinese at a
press

328
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,220
although mir exposure effect has now
been demonstrated lots and lots and lots

329
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,500
of different kinds of stimuli

330
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,540
words song

331
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,950
real words saw i'll pick jurors all
sorts of all all sorts of stuff like

332
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,579
that

333
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:51,660
the place where does the work is
painting

334
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,590
if you don't like kandinsky it doesn't
matter how many times you see a

335
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,379
kandinsky

336
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,590
you're not gonna like kandinsky

337
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,710
and idon't know why that is

338
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,060
all-new targeted shouldn't be that way

339
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,450
but it is

340
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,510
farm

341
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,340
what's up what's interesting y_-twelve
why introduce this is

342
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,460
it turns out you can get the mere
exposure affect

343
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,720
even with so little exposures to the
stimuli

344
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,620
exposures work yeah i don't see

345
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,079
the stimulus at all

346
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,849
on either because it's masked or because
its been presented for a relative a vote

347
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,920
for a very short period of time

348
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,160
this is work by zion send one of his
graduate students on the way in queens

349
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,290
or wilson

350
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,850
all who presented subjects with nonsense
polygons just

351
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,100
shapes

352
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,460
mean anything don't refer to when you
think

353
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,510
all quality custer scope

354
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,860
one of the screen

355
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,130
well for only a single millisecond

356
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,240
gave one thousand of a second

357
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,689
falsehoods just two brief

358
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:54,810
or for anybody to to see that

359
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:59,500
and all but some of these all good some
of these polygons were presented

360
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,390
the subliminally for large numbers of
trials

361
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,920
orders were presented subliminally for
only a lot of the relatively of the few

362
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,610
number of trials

363
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,710
and i like the end of these exposures

364
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,680
phones lyon france wilson's lyons

365
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,939
presented although the stimuli again
along with some lowers

366
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:18,900
and as subjects

367
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,480
to recognize them as having been
presented

368
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,850
to alter the force choice all
recognition performance was exactly

369
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,350
at chance cust they had never seen

370
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,759
the words consciously

371
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,069
though that the stimuli consciously yet
when they presented pairs old and new

372
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:35,250
parents

373
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,470
onto two subjects at some which one they
white

374
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,920
there was an effective exposure on
preference

375
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,380
people preferred the old

376
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,840
hondo the signal light which they've
been subliminally exposed

377
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,020
over the new stimuli that they have
never

378
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,130
scene and then he sends before

379
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:56,080
so the idea here is that you can get
this mere exposure affect

380
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,980
you can get

381
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,910
all light enough of something you can
induce

382
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,749
for someone to like something

383
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:06,709
even if web by virtue of exposures but
they're unconscious exposures exposures

384
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,760
that the person is not consciously
process

385
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,100
home i'm gonna

386
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,900
and almost all stick with us

387
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,350
so the general idea here is

388
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,959
mask presentation

389
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,579
still was perceived that sub exit
similar it's another example of implicit

390
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,900
perception or unconscious perception

391
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,279
unconscious perception unconscious
percept is sitting in the old in memory

392
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,830
and when you see these are the stimulus
again

393
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,300
the to connect up

394
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,950
all you get a feeling a familiarity and
that leads you to

395
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,260
uh... but like the stimulus so there's a
kind of unconscious priming effect

396
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,960
which in the which inflates all of the

397
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,670
the general from the we are in effect

398
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,600
so here we have an example

399
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,630
all conscious or motion the cut the
subjects are consciously aware that

400
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,980
they'd prefer

401
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,230
one stimulus over another

402
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:06,760
but the conscious emotion is created by
or unconscious perception

403
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,679
palm and there are some other exhibits
permits for the same thing is done with

404
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:11,600
lately

405
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,930
in the memory domain

406
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,270
alm dot the peace of the emotional
unconscious if you will

407
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,039
sometimes

408
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,570
conscious palm uh... emotion

409
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,790
on can be created by all

410
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,810
well perception memories of which were
not aware

411
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,010
there's an old roman appa graham

412
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,340
freely translated goes like this

413
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,790
all you do not love the doctor

414
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,980
foul why that is all i cannot tell

415
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,740
all you only know i do not love the

416
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,369
calm

417
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:45,920
of and assault

418
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,950
purses quite conscious

419
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,900
but you not

420
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,860
all but doesn't know what

421
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,530
your you have

422
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,490
laboratory example

423
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,559
of the same kind of thing

424
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,970
this close wilson and zion six permit is
actually considered important in the

425
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,710
history of psychology

426
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,139
because it several off what i had no
called the affect of counterrevolution

427
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:09,380
in psychology

428
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,910
in the fifties and sixties we have a
hong cognitive revolution against

429
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,780
behavior is on

430
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,899
in the eighties

431
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:20,170
all we began to experience that affect
of counterrevolution

432
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,830
all which is really kind of a penalized
by debate between robert science

433
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,140
on who is the right there and berkeley's
ullrich all richard lazarus verbally

434
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,570
richard what lazarus

435
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,670
all who debated the role of cognition

436
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,300
you know in a motion

437
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,110
and science was really really really
clear

438
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,990
that experiments likely like the ones on
the subliminal mere exposure affect

439
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:48,920
showed very clearly that in some sense
emotion was independent of cognition

440
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,320
that is of the the the prevailing

441
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,220
dot psychological theory at the time

442
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,009
was that emotional states

443
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:57,670
where the product of cognitive
constructions

444
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,890
that it was our own valuation of some
object or so our beliefs about some

445
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:02,330
object

446
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,070
that led us

447
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,930
react emotionally to that object

448
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,029
and lyon says

449
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:08,249
that can't be true

450
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,419
because we can have a motion or
reactions to things that we didn't

451
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:16,650
percy at least we didn't consciously all
perceive them the subtitle of sciences

452
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,300
all non nineteen eighty paper was

453
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,559
preferences need no inferences

454
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,540
you don't need any cognition

455
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,760
uh... in order to have affect

456
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,690
all your further went on to say that
emotional states were activated

457
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,580
automatically in our reflex like matter
in response to certain kinds of stimuli

458
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,190
all

459
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,670
he further argued that's the title of
another one of the sciences papers on

460
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,660
the privacy of affect

461
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,030
that in fact

462
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,120
the an emotional response to a stimulus
comes first

463
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,440
before there's any cognitive

464
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,300
uh... evaluation of the stimulus

465
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,650
cognition is in some sense of
afterthought

466
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:56,340
and then most radically that emotion
emotion is more powerful

467
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:01,140
then cognition on that software our
feelings or emotional reaction to

468
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,540
something that drives our reasoning

469
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,490
about it

470
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,180
on and you can see all of the this idea
in a lot of

471
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,300
work on human judgment and decision
making

472
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,630
uh... recently

473
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,429
so for example

474
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:18,340
ralph david brooks of thunder columnist
for the new york times

475
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,130
or has written a new book called the
social addl

476
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,120
all item which he argues that

477
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,340
previous social science made that made a
mistake in thinking that we are

478
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,760
conscious

479
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,730
an irrational about kind of about
various kinds of things

480
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,080
and brooks in this so in in this book
the social animal

481
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,540
argues it's quite to the contrary first

482
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,020
beyond conscious parts of the mind or
most of the morning

483
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,460
where many of the most impressive feats
of thinking take place

484
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,610
and then second

485
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:51,020
you motion is not opposed to reason but
in some sense he motioned comes first

486
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,760
a motion assigns value to things and
found out

487
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,230
and uh... and and is the the basis for
reason

488
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,030
called this is a really interesting
aspect of the affect of

489
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,389
counterrevolution

490
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:06,230
which is the identification of
unconscious processes with emotional

491
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,630
processes

492
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,400
now that's clearly not the case because
i've just spent three lectures talking

493
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,770
about unconscious cognition

494
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,860
but you can see

495
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,020
brooks and others

496
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,850
all brooks' into my mind one of the too

497
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,030
public interpreters of social sciences
specially psychology writing today

498
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,210
the other ones malcolm gladwell

499
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,940
fallen and and he's just capturing the
property per is like rights within the

500
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,850
field on now when he saw when he talks
about this

501
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:41,590
so palm we can have some emotional and
motivational states are activated alva

502
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,560
automatically

503
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,060
all

504
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,279
i'll remind you just on barge on barges
auto motive

505
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:48,320
all model for behavior

506
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,909
weary argued that motives and goals to
be aroused automatically

507
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:55,590
through these automatic unconscious
processes in response to various kinds

508
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,100
of stimuli

509
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,100
all by the men barges automotive model

510
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,060
the implication is were conscious of our
motive

511
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,919
the motive may be generated
automatically on on consciously

512
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,850
but once it's generated

513
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,200
fall more conscious of it were aware of
what our all motives are

514
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,610
so that raises the question of whether
it's possible

515
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,110
of unconscious

516
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,260
motivational states

517
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,919
that nonetheless

518
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:26,160
palm dr direct and sand and select or
behavior

519
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,060
our case for a good for unconscious a
motion was made by the late david

520
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,820
mcclelland

521
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,120
ferret almost clearly

522
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,150
on

523
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,630
when i taught at harvard i talked with
him is a really good guy

524
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,900
on and on

525
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,029
of the troops from him that we all do
you

526
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,380
uh... to him that we go with this
constant distension

527
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,010
between two forms of a more of
motivation to me

528
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,090
express your expressions of uh...
motivation

529
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,220
explicit and implicit

530
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,200
mcclelland identified explicit
motivation as our

531
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,690
we with our conscious drives then needs
and goals the things we want i want to

532
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,419
hamburg er i want to snickers bar i want
to get out of here all all those

533
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:11,510
conscious mental states that lead us to
do all boldly of what we do

534
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:15,289
all that he'd spent his entire career
studying these in the form of

535
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,100
the need for achievement

536
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,660
on say silent and academic settings

537
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,280
the need for power and political
settings

538
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,340
and the need for affiliation or intimacy
and uh... in interpersonal relations

539
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,100
but mcclelland it was also very clear

540
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,380
all of that there were some of the that
some of these well motives could all

541
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,550
parade on consciously part as well

542
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,030
on and all of them

543
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,720
in the in parallel with our earlier
definition of the implicit memory

544
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,240
we can define implicit motivation

545
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,929
as any effective a driver a goal on the
persons all behavior

546
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:54,530
in the absence of conscious awareness of
that goal the question is

547
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,210
if they're not aware of their goal

548
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,970
hadi i know they've got that goal

549
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,520
mclellan favored all about the the use
of a particular kind of assessment

550
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,250
procedure

551
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,730
originally invented by henry murray

552
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,930
hurry marie another of harvard
psychologist

553
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,900
known as the fanatic our perception test

554
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,880
and what you do in the fanatic a
perception test as you present all

555
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,070
subject

556
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,400
clinic patient or old

557
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,930
or a laboratory subject

558
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,799
with the picture

559
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,950
and just ask him to tell a story

560
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,030
although what's going on the picture a
real story a story that has a beginning

561
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,240
and a middle

562
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,550
and an end

563
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,570
all of them so for example here's this
guy here

564
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,640
and you consume tell me what's going on
this picture and vic

565
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,090
well all this person is just a lot of
the pope copy palace and not you know

566
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,859
that they became istanbul

567
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:47,940
and he's climbing down a rope from the
wall to a state with

568
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,269
so you know what with the jewel dagger
if you've ever seen the movie if you

569
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:52,170
haven't

570
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,800
rented this week and it's a terrific
movie

571
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,530
calm

572
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,270
oh or you can say

573
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:02,910
this is all although no member of the
fly-in while lenders greatest trekkies

574
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,959
artists in europe is climbing up to the
high taught

575
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:09,599
ordered i don't have a higher opens
performing before the crowned heads of

576
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,170
europe

577
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,770
and he's going to do work

578
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,150
triple double

579
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,749
flip and be clogged by his wife another
flight and will end up

580
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:19,059
and he's going to astound everybody

581
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:22,230
that's a story with a lot of achievement
imagery in it

582
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,470
all outperforming somebody else mediator
suppressing some standard of excellence

583
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,290
that unique accomplishment

584
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,309
here's another one

585
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:31,130
wilted looking at a violent

586
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:36,040
one story might be this little boy who
has two practices violin

587
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,950
all up and he really reba rather be out
films on the plane uh... played football

588
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,429
with his friends but his mother and
father making and do this

589
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:46,450
not too much achievement imagery

590
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,930
or the story might be

591
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:52,640
this is the young yahoo demanded when
who's about to play a mostar concerto

592
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,830
for queen elizabeth or something like
that

593
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,659
all and he's thinking about how he's
going to handle the contends that enough

594
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,370
first movement

595
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,540
unkempt tremendous amount of achievement
imagery and that

596
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:10,900
well what mcclelland did was to do was
to arm developers go away or coding the

597
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,909
stories the people pulled about these
kinds of pictures

598
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:16,640
so that he could almost all the
determine

599
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,100
off how much of a

600
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,790
achievement imagery or how much
affiliation imagery or how much of power

601
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:25,290
in the jury was in all of the rome

602
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,779
was it was a what what was representing
the story

603
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:28,940
and the assumption is

604
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:34,300
that people are projecting that they are
all unconscious goals and needs and

605
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,600
drives and motives

606
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,179
into the story automatic a perception
test

607
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:41,970
is a classic example of a projective
technique

608
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,130
now we have a questionnaire measures

609
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,970
of measuring of the questionnaire
measures of things like unfortunate

610
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:48,730
motivation as well

611
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,550
you can just ask people

612
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,309
how much do you enjoy doing things that
challenge you

613
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:57,180
how often do you set goals that are very
difficult to reach or whatever

614
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,880
that would be a measure of conscious

615
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,500
achievement motivation

616
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,350
mcclelland argues

617
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,450
responses to the fanatic a perception
test are measures up on conscious that

618
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,330
you can't motivation

619
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,230
and the finding is

620
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:16,170
scores on the thumb at ikea perception
test don't correlate very highly with

621
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:21,130
stark our correspondents floors palmer a
young questionnaire measure like

622
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,180
jackson's personality research form

623
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,490
here are some met met analyses reviews
of the literature

624
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,740
of the chairman motivation the need for
achievement

625
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,580
power motivation the need for power or
affiliation uh... on the motivation a

626
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,670
need for affiliation and these
correlations are really really really

627
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,410
low

628
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:45,390
you can't get correlations lower the
price

629
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,980
are and the that the other the moral of
this kind of study is

630
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,120
well in some sense

631
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,850
achievement motivation

632
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:57,330
one conscious achievement motivation can
be desilva ciated from consciously

633
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,470
treatment motivation

634
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,260
and we know that that's the case

635
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,580
we'd be because the t_-eighty measure

636
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,139
of achievement motivation

637
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:05,530
doesn't correlate

638
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:09,520
the spca bill yard questionnaire or
self-report measure that's that that's

639
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,620
basically the logic

640
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,150
and it's good logic so far as it goes

641
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,840
but the fact of the matter is

642
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,190
that showing all lack of correlation
between two measures

643
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,220
is only the first step

644
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,830
in convincing people

645
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,690
that one is a measure of unconscious
emotion

646
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,240
all of the motivation and the other is a
measure of conscious motivation

647
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,249
kinda prima fascia villains

648
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:37,130
first glance and say okay

649
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,570
dissociation between conscious and
unconscious motivation you'd expect low

650
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,150
correlations

651
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,760
but you've gotta have something more

652
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,769
all than that

653
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:44,950
and the problem is

654
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,990
but truly methods of assessment

655
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,690
are stolen different

656
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,799
that the by catalog correlation

657
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:54,879
just by virtue of something that the
psychometric shins called method

658
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:55,790
variance

659
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,450
though don't do ya

660
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:01,750
further apart to methods of measured
defer the board distinct who methods of

661
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,350
measure

662
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,309
to methods of measurement

663
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:05,080
are

664
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,910
on the lower the correlations could be
between even if they're both conscious

665
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,750
of psychometric track

666
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,630
find that might actually don't turn out

667
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,260
achievement motivation

668
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,629
measured by a questionnaire an
achievement motivation

669
00:30:19,629 --> 00:30:23,629
measured by early on something like
thirty eighty whether different kinds of

670
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:24,610
achievement motivation

671
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,929
and if they're actually different kinds
of achievement motivation

672
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:31,430
then you wouldn't necessarily expected
from correlation between them

673
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,320
so the finding that there's although
correlation between a questionnaire

674
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:35,770
measure

675
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,980
of social motives

676
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,420
all it was uh... t_-eighty measure

677
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,760
of social motives

678
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,579
is kind of necessary

679
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:49,240
but not sufficient to get to demonstrate
at the one who really is unconscious

680
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,399
unfortunately bohot implicit motivation
literature doesn't much

681
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,340
doesn't usually go much beyond

682
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,110
the arm a finding of all low correlation
so we just don't know

683
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,280
what's going on

684
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,330
let's turn of the briefly to alm

685
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,750
uh... too

686
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,270
the iaaf that the question of
unconscious emotion

687
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:14,070
can you have unconscious emotional state

688
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,250
feeling state and affect in st

689
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,820
that drives your behavior

690
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,390
even though you're not aware of what
those of what those feelings or

691
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,399
arm

692
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:24,120
again

693
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,990
although

694
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,990
that there are direct theoretical
reasons to think that's that this might

695
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,290
be possible

696
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,720
peter wagon

697
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,820
of although long-time a motion
researcher all told of has proposed a

698
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,409
new what he calls a multiple systems

699
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:39,700
theory of a motion

700
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,130
which basically says that there are
three components to every emotional

701
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,630
response you walked down the aisle

702
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,670
when you walked on the campus in a
guerilla jumps out at you from behind

703
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:53,460
the bushes on you have an emotional
response three things happen

704
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,110
there's what he calls the cognitive
component the refers to the subjective

705
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:57,749
experience

706
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,710
of emotion

707
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,960
you feel scared

708
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,479
second

709
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:05,009
there's a physiological component or a
covert

710
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:08,600
also matic response to your heart starts
pounding wildly

711
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,820
for example

712
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,920
and then there is

713
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,310
the behavioral or overt behavioral
response

714
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,100
all which is the star running away or

715
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,110
whatever it is you do when you're
frightened by the gorilla

716
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,670
fault

717
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:26,410
lines point was that usually we think of
these three components of an emotional

718
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,409
response is going to go there

719
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:33,290
when you're afraid your heart starts
pounding a star running away

720
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:37,190
the coupling between these are three
components on the line proposed was

721
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,600
actually in perfect

722
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,750
and that could lead to state

723
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,150
uh... rachman and harmsen called
desegregate

724
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,020
adi synchrony along the components of a
motion

725
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,640
so that for example

726
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,800
show the physiological and behavioral

727
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,950
components of a motion

728
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,370
but you might not show

729
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,529
the cognitive

730
00:32:57,529 --> 00:32:59,080
component of a motion

731
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,639
and that's the situation

732
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:02,330
that were really interested in here

733
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,530
so we've got an emotional state

734
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,510
usually we think of these things is
coupled

735
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,059
so they all run off together

736
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:12,750
in a state of desegregate

737
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,820
you might have an emotional state

738
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,289
and have over

739
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:19,159
motor expression of that at the home
state

740
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:22,110
might have a covert physiological
expression that state

741
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,469
for per barriers reasons

742
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:26,130
you might not have the subjective
experience

743
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,710
of the emotion

744
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,650
sold lang's theory is interesting
because it actually lays a foundation

745
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,800
the person for suggesting

746
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,280
the subjective experience of a motion
conscious experience of an emotion might

747
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,249
be dissociated from motor

748
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:45,590
farm uh... or or physiological
manifestations

749
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,060
of that emotion

750
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:53,700
and there's some evidence for this song
but it's not very good evidence on them

751
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,930
uh... admit that i'm just it's just a
plausibility argument i'm gonna skip

752
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,929
those

753
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:01,090
but still

754
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,390
because of the because these three
systems might be arthur might be good to

755
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,510
so simple and principal

756
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,200
weekend

757
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,329
joist as schachter did for implicit
memory

758
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:14,200
just as mcclellan bid for implicit

759
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,809
motivation

760
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:15,720
we can

761
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,040
our proposed at least in principle

762
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,719
a distinction between

763
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:24,879
to expressions of a motion explicit
emotion having to do with your

764
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,220
conscious mood or

765
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,699
feeling stater affect in st

766
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,710
and implicit emotion which we can define
as

767
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,739
any of fact

768
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,450
of an emotional response

769
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,069
on a person's behavior

770
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:38,649
in the absence

771
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:39,590
subjective awareness

772
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,149
of that allotment of that emotional
response

773
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:44,009
and those behavior was perfect

774
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:45,799
might take the formal

775
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:50,989
facial expressions or other both other
overt motor-voter behavior

776
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,609
smile

777
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:56,229
because someone consciously happy even
though i feel miserable

778
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:56,839
palm

779
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:59,630
or of covert physiological response

780
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,840
my heart's racine meddling

781
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,439
on even though uh... don't

782
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:05,599
on any kind of

783
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,519
fear or langer at least in principle

784
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:14,380
you want to be able to

785
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,149
where are you seeing the most attention
paid

786
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,160
the idea of unconscious emotion

787
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,359
is in the social psychological
literature all martin relatively large

788
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,400
social psychological literature now

789
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,250
that is god claiming to have evidence
for the dissociation between to deferred

790
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:32,840
expressions

791
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,950
of a social attitude

792
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,559
farm

793
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:41,190
on explicit attitude conscious attitude
or implicit attitude

794
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,580
unconscious

795
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,039
on attitude

796
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,069
and all

797
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:48,429
on that this is all relevant to the idea
of one conscious a motion because

798
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:50,469
attitudes are fundamentally

799
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:50,980
emotional

800
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,539
on in nature

801
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:57,269
part of the attitude was originally
defined by are l_l_ for stone in the

802
00:35:57,269 --> 00:35:58,299
nineteen twenties

803
00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:01,209
as a after active disposition

804
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:01,939
disposition

805
00:36:01,939 --> 00:36:03,249
favor something

806
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:04,659
or to opposed

807
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:05,869
or something

808
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:08,880
soul our attitudes always take the form
of

809
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,769
some kind of pro were empty like or
dislike home uh...

810
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:14,490
positive or negative

811
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,029
uh... statement

812
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:20,160
and ever since they were stoned we've
assessed harder our attitudes

813
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,819
basically by sold by self-report scales

814
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:26,560
all the political pollster will call you
up at the dinner roll over and say

815
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,499
well do you like browner deal like
whitman

816
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:31,529
okay would you favor in the election

817
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:35,579
and you're supposed to be able to say
who your favor and an eighth it in the

818
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:36,050
election

819
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:39,170
because you're supposed to be
consciously aware of what your attitudes

820
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,019
are

821
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:44,619
arial unfavorably clear power plants or
not or you would favor of drilling and

822
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,950
ad war or not

823
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,229
does uh... these were all

824
00:36:48,229 --> 00:36:50,949
paula assessments of conscious attitudes

825
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:55,089
what what gramm golden but largely this
is the same greenwald who did that those

826
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:57,169
subliminal affect the prime minister
haris

827
00:36:57,169 --> 00:37:00,140
well greenwald and balaji balaji was at
one time

828
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,619
his graduate student

829
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,640
all proposed

830
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,190
was that we also carry around in our
heads

831
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,539
implicit attitudes

832
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:12,929
on conscious attitudes which also affect
our behavior

833
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:17,129
all behavior that's attributable to an
altitude that we're not aware that we

834
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:18,259
have

835
00:37:18,259 --> 00:37:20,249
unconscious attitude

836
00:37:20,249 --> 00:37:23,460
that drives our behavior just like
conscious attitudes to

837
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,829
the difference being

838
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:25,789
we're aware

839
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:26,830
of our conscious

840
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,400
or explicit attitudes

841
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,550
were not aware

842
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,659
of our unconsciously implicit added

843
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:34,429
so i would you know

844
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:35,730
david mcclelland

845
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:41,029
propose diplomatic our perception test
as a measure called unconscious motives

846
00:37:41,029 --> 00:37:42,770
how we're going to measure

847
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:48,219
unconscious attitudes and other aspects
of the unconscious

848
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:51,670
greenwald unbutton archie have proposed
that the that unconscious attitudes can

849
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,040
be measured by

850
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,710
something they call the implicit added
to the press

851
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,509
anybody done this on the web

852
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:58,719
couple of people

853
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:02,350
some really good at really others really
interesting exercise

854
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,569
here's how the implicit attitudes test
works

855
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:07,779
first in the implicit attitudes test

856
00:38:07,779 --> 00:38:12,319
people arrested make a series of di ka
doesn't know that all of the dichotomous

857
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:14,219
judgments i've made made this off here

858
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:16,280
for example in phrase one

859
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,550
they're presented with a bunch of names
and all the subject has to do

860
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,880
is to make a judgment about whether it's
a swedish name

861
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,799
or a finishing

862
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:26,570
okay that

863
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,889
presumes that you know the difference

864
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,479
swedes and fins know the difference

865
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:34,609
so i'll turn and as finishes erickson
this leadership

866
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:38,039
uh... and and and and so on and so forth

867
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:39,640
sold out all the subject of

868
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,130
press one key at the name is swim
swedish

869
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,430
press in other key if the name is finish
bang bang bang all the way through a

870
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,420
whole long list of names

871
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,879
in phase two

872
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:53,329
the subject is asked is presented with a
number all the words referring to

873
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:55,029
objects or activities or whatever

874
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:57,439
and is simply ask the press one key

875
00:38:57,439 --> 00:39:00,160
if the if the word refers to a good
thing

876
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,779
and another key if the word refers to a
bad thing

877
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:10,779
admiration is good aggression is bad
caresses good abuses bad freedom is good

878
00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:14,390
then what grade woman but i should do

879
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:19,360
is they just kind of superimpose the
tasks so that the swedish finished

880
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:19,730
judgment

881
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:24,010
is alternating with the good and bad
judgment sometimes this we don't

882
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,170
sometimes and they will come up neck to
make a judgment but whether it's swedish

883
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,599
you'll finish

884
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,239
sometimes a word will come up they have
to make a judgment about whether it's a

885
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,989
good or a bad thing

886
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:38,529
and in phase three of the experiment for
example

887
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:42,239
yugoslav swedish and goodwill sherry
teach you press the same t_v_ if the

888
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,759
name is swedish

889
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:47,489
as you would get the word refers to a
good thing

890
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:50,269
and then there's a control condition
which i don't want to get into and then

891
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:52,209
in phase five

892
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:54,140
uh... there is a look at the finish

893
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,259
share is a key

894
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,599
with org with a with wit with bed

895
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,560
the home

896
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,489
uh... you use the same to you today

897
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:03,630
to identify whether a word of the name
is finish

898
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:08,690
as opposed to and uh... and to determine
whether or the word refers to a good

899
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,390
thing

900
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,909
now why do you do this

901
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:16,250
the rationale for the implicit of the
associations test

902
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:21,800
is based on the rock pool principle in
human factors called stimulus response

903
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,989
compatibility

904
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:24,869
and the idea here is

905
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:26,250
that you have off

906
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,720
faster response

907
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,519
when the response is compatible with the
stimulus

908
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,660
and this was originally discovered by
some early human factors guides

909
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,839
all who worked with had their subjects

910
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:41,240
simply make of dish or judgment

911
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,130
about whether

912
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:44,549
an object was on the left

913
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:47,009
for the right of another robbed

914
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,909
and it turns out

915
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:52,859
stiff the stimulus is on the left your
faster to respond

916
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:54,249
with your left hand

917
00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:58,149
and if the stimulus is on your right
your faster respond with your right hand

918
00:40:58,149 --> 00:41:01,069
that stimulus response compatibility

919
00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:04,059
in the context of the implicit emotions
test

920
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:07,289
the applicable to all of the implication
is yes

921
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:08,410
that if you're making

922
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,859
using the same key

923
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:14,719
to respond to swedish name is and to
positive words

924
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,559
and that's

925
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,410
you do that faster

926
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,879
that if you have to use a different each
respond the swedish names

927
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:21,830
and all

928
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,839
and uh... uh... uh... good words

929
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,280
that means that yours

930
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,070
down deep down in your head someplace
there's a common conscious association

931
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,959
between

932
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:31,849
swedish

933
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:34,639
and good

934
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,270
and

935
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,890
suppose you're making the same response
to finish names and negative

936
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,739
of words

937
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:42,400
faster response latencies

938
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,369
when you're using the same key to say
the name is finish

939
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:47,980
as you

940
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,970
boggled who had the same key did you use

941
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,969
to say that a word is bad

942
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:57,200
that is supposed to reveal hey on or
unconscious all association

943
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,029
between

944
00:41:58,029 --> 00:41:59,190
being finish

945
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,769
and being

946
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:05,319
okay that's the logic of the implicit
association yes

947
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:08,690
on here's an early study by greenwald
and his colleagues

948
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,140
on this is all implicit stall racial
stereotyping and white subjects

949
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,630
palm

950
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,819
white college students were presented
with wooden bad words

951
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:21,249
but there were also presented with
stereotypically black and white

952
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:22,359
names

953
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:23,100
palm

954
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,489
and it turned out

955
00:42:24,489 --> 00:42:25,959
that palm

956
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:28,499
here is that secures the most important
thing

957
00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:29,369
farm

958
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:31,040
when white names

959
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,490
were associated with a positive response
keen about us are faster response

960
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,729
latency

961
00:42:36,729 --> 00:42:37,699
the blackness

962
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:40,079
were associated

963
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,029
a positive response on wednesday

964
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:44,900
com and that's so that

965
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,129
that person suggest

966
00:42:46,129 --> 00:42:47,239
the people have

967
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:49,280
and implicit association

968
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,089
between

969
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:51,549
whites and good

970
00:42:51,549 --> 00:42:54,130
and black

971
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:56,069
here is another example this is not

972
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:58,350
a large uninteresting study

973
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:02,049
on implicit stereotyping in japanese and
korean subjects

974
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:06,180
they had our korean subjects judge
whether name was japanese or korean

975
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,530
they had japanese subjects associate
with judge whether a name with japanese

976
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,630
or korean then they made a good bad
judgment

977
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,869
as well

978
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:14,589
and what you can see here

979
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:15,390
is that

980
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,909
if the subjects were korean

981
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:24,450
they responded faster when mccurry okie
was paired with a good ki

982
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:28,199
wendy japanese ke was pure with the
griffey

983
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:29,980
and when the subject for japanese

984
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,570
the japanese subjects responded faster
when the japanese ke was paired with the

985
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:38,380
good ki and the korean ke abdomen the
currently was paired with a good ki and

986
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,280
this is supposed to reveal

987
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,760
phone dot idea uh... kind of

988
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,329
prejudice against or of that uh...
negative attitudes about koreans

989
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:50,259
on the part of japanese uh... those
students

990
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:54,559
and about japanese on the part of
koreans do

991
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:57,920
there are now in the literature

992
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,989
honduras

993
00:43:59,989 --> 00:44:00,429
thousands

994
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,970
of studies using this methodology

995
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,199
to look at home

996
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:06,940
to look at the pump power

997
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,810
uh... did to assess peoples

998
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,249
implicit unconscious attitudes towards
various kinds of things

999
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,839
and the important thing here is

1000
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:16,519
it turns out

1001
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:19,539
the albeit bb attitude measured

1002
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:22,799
by the i_a_e_a_ t_v_ implicit
association coast

1003
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:24,640
is essentially

1004
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,249
independent

1005
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:28,499
of people's attitudes when they are
asked in this case

1006
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,019
all of the white subjects rest how do
you feel about black people

1007
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:34,269
okay what's your attitude towards black
people

1008
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:36,709
the correlation between

1009
00:44:36,709 --> 00:44:39,499
prejudice as measured by the i_a_e_a_ t

1010
00:44:39,499 --> 00:44:44,449
and explicit prejudice as wrote as
measured by a spill simple rating scale

1011
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:45,499
very well

1012
00:44:45,499 --> 00:44:46,989
in dahil

1013
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:50,489
britain in in the in the teens which is
a pretty low correlation

1014
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:52,269
when you do the japanese study

1015
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:55,489
you look at the correlation between

1016
00:44:55,489 --> 00:44:58,760
or ethnic prejudice as measured by the
are yuki

1017
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,479
and ethnic prejudice as measured by
archaeologist simple rating scale

1018
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:04,630
it's again

1019
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:05,669
relatively low

1020
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,689
of closer to zero

1021
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:09,180
band called into one

1022
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,100
and this is taken as evidence

1023
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,900
that people's unconscious ethnic and
racial attitudes

1024
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,580
are not the same as their conscience

1025
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,019
racial an ethic

1026
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:22,759
attitudes that there's a unconscious
attitude that's different

1027
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:25,599
the conscious

1028
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,509
brian no seconds part of this research
group understood give you a flavor for

1029
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:30,859
what this is

1030
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:31,910
on has

1031
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:36,240
ald of thought constructed all you need
to use the measure all sorts of

1032
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:36,930
attitudes

1033
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,969
here's one about job

1034
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:42,679
your attitude towards pants versus
courts

1035
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:46,619
paul your attitude of the poor jocks
versus verbs

1036
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:52,059
all your attitude towards all tom cruise
versus denzel washington

1037
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:54,440
chawla cats vs dogs

1038
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,769
palm jazz versus teen pop music and so
on and so i missed you

1039
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:03,329
if there's a whole industry now are
devising these tests

1040
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:08,019
and that um... and again but the point
of this for tougher or exercises that

1041
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:10,669
there's all relatively low correlation

1042
00:46:10,669 --> 00:46:11,440
between

1043
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,459
on attitude as measured by the i_a_e_a_
t

1044
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:18,999
and that same added to it as measured by
self-report

1045
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:22,630
and that poem that evidence that lack of
correlation

1046
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:24,209
is used to suggest

1047
00:46:24,209 --> 00:46:28,130
that we really do have or unconscious
attitudes

1048
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:30,380
influence or behavior that are different

1049
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,959
from or conscious attitudes

1050
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,369
that's the argument behind the i-eighty

1051
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:37,450
on and again

1052
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:41,650
this is although certainly the most
substantial body of literature

1053
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:42,120
suggestion

1054
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,640
that we actually do have

1055
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,709
on conscious emotional states

1056
00:46:45,709 --> 00:46:48,449
in the form of various kinds of
attitudes

1057
00:46:48,449 --> 00:46:49,420
that are different

1058
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,850
from our conscious

1059
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:56,049
emotional states

1060
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:57,660
that's fine as far as it goes

1061
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,999
there are some serious problems with the
i_a_e_a_ t

1062
00:47:00,999 --> 00:47:04,789
problems that are so serious there when
you run home tonight and take the

1063
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:05,390
identity

1064
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,089
and it feeds you back

1065
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:10,200
all the information that your prejudiced
against some group

1066
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,539
you should take it with a grain of salt

1067
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,980
there are all sorts of con from noon
factors

1068
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,309
one of the prom perhaps the most all of

1069
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:24,769
or the uh... the most important in this
context is target familiarity

1070
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:25,899
white subjects

1071
00:47:25,899 --> 00:47:28,319
than on valuating

1072
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,790
stereotypically

1073
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:30,579
african-american

1074
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:31,979
first names

1075
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:33,689
may

1076
00:47:33,689 --> 00:47:35,249
what like they don't like them

1077
00:47:35,249 --> 00:47:38,199
but that may be completely apart a fact
of the fact that they're just not

1078
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:41,489
familiar

1079
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:42,949
moreover

1080
00:47:42,949 --> 00:47:45,230
beyond haiti makes no distinction

1081
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,289
between active prejudice where u

1082
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:50,799
dislikes somebody or something

1083
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:52,150
and simply being

1084
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:54,839
less favorably inclined

1085
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,200
if u like white people but

1086
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,380
don't like black people your that's
going to show up on the i_a_e_a_ to use

1087
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,269
a reaction time difference

1088
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:06,899
but if you white white people and you
like black people just up as much as you

1089
00:48:06,899 --> 00:48:11,410
like white people that's also going to
show up as racial prejudice

1090
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,630
on the i_a_e_a_ t

1091
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:17,439
and that doesn't seem right

1092
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:19,980
plus this is not believable e difficult
task

1093
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,759
okay as you'll find out when you tried
to do it

1094
00:48:22,759 --> 00:48:26,049
also there are all sorts of
methodological problems but the big

1095
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:28,889
problem that i want to talk about here

1096
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:33,119
it's not actually clearer

1097
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,140
prejudice or attitude as measured by the
i_a_e_a_ t

1098
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,519
is actually

1099
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:40,049
dissociated

1100
00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:42,530
prejudice or attitude as measured by

1101
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:44,279
part of the self-report scale

1102
00:48:44,279 --> 00:48:46,150
to make that point let's just go back

1103
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:47,769
to no sex crap

1104
00:48:47,769 --> 00:48:49,979
the median correlation

1105
00:48:49,979 --> 00:48:52,680
between self reports of attitudes

1106
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,790
and attitudes is revealed by the
i_a_e_a_ t

1107
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:59,199
is a whopping point four eight

1108
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:00,359
big correlation

1109
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:04,549
in personality and social psychology
kill for a correlation that day

1110
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:06,430
okayed so your mother

1111
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:09,859
alone

1112
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:14,630
if if the correlation between the
ostensible e unconscious attitude

1113
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:19,090
and yes ten sibley conscious attitude is
about as big as we can get in social

1114
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:22,470
science research a croatian point four
eight

1115
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:24,220
there's really no reason to think

1116
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,729
that whatever the i_e_ eighty is
measuring

1117
00:49:26,729 --> 00:49:28,619
is measuring

1118
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:30,139
conscious added to

1119
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:32,199
it's measuring something

1120
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:32,830
arguably

1121
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:37,399
but it's not necessarily measuring and
unconscious

1122
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:40,229
so you got to take this with a grain of
salt

1123
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:42,479
so there's a problem with the i_a_e_a_ t

1124
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:47,589
all that it's not clear that unconscious
attitudes really had been dissociated

1125
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:50,279
from conscious attitudes

1126
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,470
on one from home from my point of view

1127
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:53,829
the i_a_e_a_ t

1128
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:58,069
hole really kind of illustrates what
william james called the psychologists

1129
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:59,140
fallacy

1130
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,769
which comes into forms

1131
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:03,890
the first out element of the
psychologist alessi

1132
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,759
is the idea that every event has a
psychological cause

1133
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:09,009
well they don't

1134
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:13,439
okay sometimes things just aren't did
come out the way they do because of the

1135
00:50:13,439 --> 00:50:15,539
mechanics of the response

1136
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:19,239
the more important part of a
psychologist fallacy

1137
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:23,219
the psychology idea that the
psychologists explanation of behavior is

1138
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:25,079
the correct one

1139
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:27,199
and this brings us back to freud

1140
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,099
troy's biggest mistake

1141
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:33,509
heat told people what was on their run
conscious mind

1142
00:50:33,509 --> 00:50:36,599
you know one of weep with your mother
and you want to kill your father

1143
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,289

1144
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:42,779

that

1145
00:50:42,779 --> 00:50:44,409
the r_u_ eighty

1146
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:46,509
does exactly the same thing

1147
00:50:46,509 --> 00:50:49,370
it's just super dot dad more mechanical
and

1148
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:50,390
more automated

1149
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,480

1150
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:56,889

because were psychologists and we have

1153
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:07,789

1154
00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:11,229
