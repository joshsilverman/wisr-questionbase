1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,310
came with store that was just a little
bit of housekeeping

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,380
which is to say that

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,830
sometime this week we ought to have been
waiting list of everything else

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,869
straightened out

5
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:13,269
we're going to do our best

6
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:17,070
for those who were still on a waiting
list for movie you watched waitlisted

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,169
into

8
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:20,149
enrollment in the class

9
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:22,449
palm again your chances of

10
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:25,079
getting off the waiting list of the
cluster better

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,310
if you're waitlisted for a discussion
section that has

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,540
available seats in it

13
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,990
whatever will do our best to difficult

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,560
all right

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,940
topic today for the next couple of

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,760
davis is the relationship between mind
and body

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,760
i suspect that roughly half of you got
interested in this course because he

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,400
thought we were going to talk about
drugs

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,650
we're not

20
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,230
and the other half of you

21
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,490
got interest in this christmas you
thought

22
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,880
you can watch me solve the mind-body

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,910
and i'm not

24
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,630
hall so just wanted everybody
understands

25
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,840
what's going to happen here

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,920
which is something else and firewood

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,300
mind-body problem i think has never been
better expressed penned by thomas nagel

28
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,260
loss for it and why you know

29
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,810
context of an essay it is about what
we've referred to a little bit what is

30
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,220
it like to be a batch

31
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,270
and to remember that naval starts out of
a a guard with that

32
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,190
the fact of the new organism has a
mental states that is conscious

33
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,340
experience of all

34
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,740
means that there's something it's like
to be that organism

35
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,630
there's something it's like to be a
cuban who's hungry or who sees chairs

36
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,290
there's something it's like who batches

37
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,510
flying around in finance tax and all
that

38
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,470
of one of the points that uh... that
made one star argue

39
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,840
there are lots of other ways to think
about behavior

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,479
but those are there ways none of which
really captured the idea that mental

41
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,210
life goes on as games put it

42
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,720
the first of all the uh... the person

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,739
point for a psychologist is that
thinking of some sort grows on it

44
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,660
and then they go goes on guard

45
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,019
argued the real mind-body problem comes
from the fact that

46
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:20,439
them

47
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:23,749
the experience of having conscious
mental states

48
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:25,230
doesn't seem to be

49
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,540
analyze the below into anything else

50
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,889
and uh... you can't have it

51
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:34,290
just inspections of systems of
functional states the cause

52
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,189
so various kinds of facts

53
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,470
because they're all sorts of functional
states that could be

54
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,449
work there

55
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:44,249
without giving rise to conscious
experience

56
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:47,459
so that's the real puzzle of or wrong

57
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,689
slow for naval and for many other
philosophers

58
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:51,709
as well

59
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,139
and so it comes to me i say that nagel

60
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:56,149
onto specifies what i think is

61
00:02:56,149 --> 00:02:59,950
what really bothers people about the
relationship between my apartment

62
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,839
why the body

63
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:06,269
consciousness is what makes the
mind-body problem really intractable

64
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,900
without consciousness for mind-body
problem would be much less interesting

65
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,750
because of all i could think of it

66
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,890
quality i think that that is combining
is some set of structures and processes

67
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,530
that intervene between environmental
stimulus

68
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,319
and behavioral response

69
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,699
well because thermostats and computers
and all sorts of things that could do

70
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:26,449
that

71
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:30,639
and we don't ever asked a question about
whether or

72
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,040
whether their conscience

73
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,609
so without consciousness and they want
answers the mind-body problem would be

74
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:37,360
much less interesting because

75
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,439
frankly the money would be much less
interesting

76
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,069
with consciousness however

77
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,379
it seems hopeless

78
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,049
alternates trying to figure out why

79
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:52,079
evolve out of the consciousness makes
the mind-body problem all of the seem

80
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,619
hopeless

81
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:56,919
but i want to talk about today and that
will expand on over the next couple of

82
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,089
days

83
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:00,279
palm

84
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:03,909
the whitewater problem begins with a big
heart

85
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,719
alva where the course weekend a week ago

86
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,079
over back to him on and we keep coming
back to him from time to time

87
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,839
all who argued all four

88
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:14,390
altered

89
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,459
two things first on he argued that there
was a strict separation between

90
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,299
humans and animals

91
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,639
descartes

92
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,389
palm

93
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,030
said that he

94
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,710
came to us floss appeal is understanding
through a process of radical methodical

95
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,240
skepticism that is he tried to doubt
everything

96
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,440
and try to figure out

97
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,729
what he could go

98
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:37,389
but he actually did you do that

99
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:42,220
on a big part was there you know
faithful loyal and faithful fall over

100
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,460
all

101
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,809
sort of the uh... roman catholic church

102
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:49,999
he saw what had happened to people like
uh... galloway oh and you're going to

103
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,860
brood over there trying to

104
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,819
on a platform about things that seem to
contradict

105
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,389
the church doctrine

106
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:58,879
so right off the bat in my view anyway

107
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,689
descartes failed it is

108
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:02,679
alderdice philosophical program

109
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:05,559
because he's at work

110
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,360
human beings have souls

111
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,370
animals do not

112
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,349
animals are just or unconscious reflex
machines all they do is respond

113
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:15,280
reflexively too

114
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,779
of the end of the two stimulus of and
supporting the environment

115
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,889
but humans have consciousness

116
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,900
and that frees humans from reflex action

117
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,729
uh... we have reflexes but it frees us
from all from reliance on reflex action

118
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,060
take our target because

119
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,870
uh... we have minds by which they
cartman souls

120
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,689
file word which the decor thought

121
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:39,999
on gave us on gave us free will

122
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:42,189
so it's consciousness

123
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:44,339
defined really in terms of free will

124
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,849
or that separates home

125
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:48,259
human beings

126
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,759
from various animals

127
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,620
and then called

128
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,290
nordic are trying to figure out exactly
what he meant by undetected

129
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,240
animals have

130
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,609
bodies

131
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:00,309
humans have bodies and mines

132
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:03,379
and he came up with a philosophical
position that is

133
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:06,870
first known by the phrase substance
dualism

134
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,619
all by which is that what

135
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:12,080
mind and body are characterized by too

136
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,860
are composed of two quite different
substances

137
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,249
bodies are characterized by

138
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:23,249
substances that have a property known as
extension that is they take up

139
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,490
whereas

140
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,689
mind is in material it doesn't pick up
space

141
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,360
and it's characterized flying

142
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,919
so we've got this

143
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,930
or that don't do well with the martin

144
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,419
in the world mines composed of one kind
of substance

145
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:43,389
buddies composed of another

146
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,479
just as a footnote

147
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:46,570
from here

148
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:51,600
that we get on entire tradition from
descartes up into the nineteenth century

149
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,009
or philosophers arguing that psychology
could never be a science

150
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:02,029
a position that was adopted as recently
as well as a manual kant

151
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:03,280
in the late though

152
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,710
blvd century

153
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,260
and the position

154
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,289
against which does cycle physicist that
we talked about last week

155
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:14,729
rebels

156
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:20,509
really succinctly he says look

157
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:25,119
depends on measurement

158
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:28,889
condescension lien adopted the cartesian
position

159
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:31,510
mind wasn't characterized by

160
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,649
extension the didnt a company

161
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:34,380
at all

162
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,740
so so what we can measure mine

163
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,529
so you can't have a science of the line

164
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:42,599
psychology has to remain a philosophical
discipline

165
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,949
and it was only in the halted could be a
bit late in the nineteenth century

166
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,779
sometime after contra died

167
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,409
that braver and fact mirror at all and
held bolts out of the end of the

168
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,520
nineteenth century psychophysical

169
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,619
decided they're going to try to make
your mind anyway somebody else

170
00:07:58,619 --> 00:07:59,830
public public did that

171
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,449
they did simply by us to be people
assigned numbers to their experience

172
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,150
the public polite is really bright given
an eight

173
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,370
if it's not so great

174
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,850
give it a lesser number and they found
that those numbers the people assigned

175
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,539
to their experiences

176
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:16,169
cold air raid waffling

177
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,860
physical stimulation withdraw activities
at bundy in the body and so on

178
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,940
and therefore begin to develop real
science in psychology broke all

179
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,450
comes as a reaction

180
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,569
octopus

181
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:28,799
okay now

182
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:33,439
okay so first we go body a mind-boggling
gold composed of two different kinds of

183
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:34,360
substances

184
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,929
but descartes wasn't eight dummy

185
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:42,110
he understood that mind and body
interrupted subha

186
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,190
he gave us this

187
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,810
after he saw fickle position

188
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,550
which is known as interactive dualism
which argued that mind and body

189
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,130
though they into other though they're
composed of different substances

190
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,730
nevertheless interact with each other

191
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,360
and descartes examples of this were
really gone quite cleary says in the

192
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,010
first place

193
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,640
we get a great deal of our knowledge
through our sensory organs

194
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,920
we see the world we hear about to the
world we smelled pace things

195
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,660
and all that happens by virtue of our
bodies

196
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,029
if you blind

197
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:20,320
some body he can see anymore he can't
have those kinds of mental state

198
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,660
if u deaf and somebody he can't hear
anymore

199
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,470
you can't have those kind

200
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,640
malval mental state

201
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,920
that's the first weight that mind and
body attract is that

202
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,310
some of our knowledge columns through
war of them

203
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,120
uh... is channeled through our bodies

204
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,420
ought to be other way that of mind and
body interact

205
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,930
is that our thoughts of fact our barnali

206
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,840
on actions if i say i would like to
raise my right hand

207
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,420
about raise my right hand

208
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,460
fought of raising my right hand

209
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,820
somehow causes me to raised my right

210
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,540
that's the real problem here which is
not just of mind and body or composed of

211
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,960
different substances which is bad now

212
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,480
but you've got to have some way hongkong

213
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,180
of

214
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,490
these two

215
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,980
completely different kinds of things

216
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,430
two completely different kinds of things

217
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,770
interact with each other and a card had
no idea how this happened

218
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,020
except

219
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,010
he had this idea

220
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,600
that material substances could affect
the material substances

221
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,940
there had to be some passageway that had
to be some point

222
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,630
where the tumor

223
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,230
uh... they collected

224
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,150
and descartes thought he found it

225
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,700
in the pineal gland

226
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,000
which is this

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,930
that sits

228
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,200
right there

229
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,460
all valid in the yard

230
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,589
in the brain

231
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:41,990
and while wide choose the pineal gland
might not choose something else

232
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,130
caldwell first location

233
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,310
all of them take are located the pineal
gland right in the exact center of the

234
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,340
brain

235
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,270
case with up at school

236
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,290
if you're going to have some place for
by the body that we read what better

237
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,560
place

238
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,080
for for that to be

239
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,520
that donald

240
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,260
amid a dent in the exact center of the
brain so that made sense

241
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,020
argued also thought that the pineal
gland was the only structuring the break

242
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,870
that there was only one up

243
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,010
you got to hamas fears of all that kind
of stuff

244
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,529
uh... two sets of spinal nerves and hold
on all of that

245
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:16,409
but there seem to

246
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,570
they tend to be only one

247
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,800
one pineal gland and said okay

248
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,459
all of that uh... that again makes sense
to pick up the center of this

249
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:25,590
saying this

250
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,920
homogeneous things right center

251
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,560
on the group of patients

252
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,420
and then finally of

253
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,110
the descartes thought that all the human
beings

254
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,700
pad pineal gland

255
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,090
your book theodore brains and cat
parades and things like that we didn't

256
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,120
find a pineal gland is that

257
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,280
or the humans have martins

258
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,629
solely humans had been some structure
where mind and body can come together

259
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:52,290
and here's a structure that only humans
have

260
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,400
all and so this must be it you can come
to see the reasoning

261
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,320
unfortunately

262
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,180
ficar dot

263
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,970
two i three wrong

264
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,319
all of the if you do your histology

265
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:06,839
called all of the it turns out that the
pineal gland is not a unitary clump of

266
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,260
matter

267
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,330
that they've got they've got different
kind of structure different kinds of

268
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,810
structures associated with it

269
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,590
and it turns out the pineal glands not
uniquely human either

270
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,769
small dogs and cats

271
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:22,649
birds have them it's like virtue of the
people and that

272
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:26,550
words for example

273
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,810
regulators sleep cycles

274
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,970
rest about animals to sleep

275
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,610
also that this could work out either
bucket seemed like a good idea at the

276
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,910
time

277
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,290
thought he'd had this way of solving

278
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,760
forces mind-body problem that's not the
same opinion planned this and important

279
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,720
it is the tube

280
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,420
it does it's important for a sleep cycle

281
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,420
but it's not exactly

282
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,850
pollute the place where mind and body
come together

283
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,190
so card gives us this

284
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,990
stalled that this idea of substance
dualism and this is even more

285
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,600
interesting idea of interactive dualism

286
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,540
and we're kinda been stuck with it ever
since

287
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,880
all of this although debit cards

288
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,110
duelist ic

289
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,740
intuition

290
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,210
that is that mind and body are somehow
different

291
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,060
is a position that is very appealing

292
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,160
the people

293
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,540
on a large numbers of groans

294
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,010
first there are lots of religious
doctrines

295
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,640
that part of that argue that something
like a school separates

296
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,050
all human beings from all of the local
from other animals

297
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,440
and all

298
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,880
tone of the world

299
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,069
since the enlightenment

300
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:44,680
there's been is kind of gradual trends
of the translation for first

301
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,270
hopes for into mind

302
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,320
so humans have mines in animals told

303
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,220
orion and minded the consciousness of
the humans have

304
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,160
the other animals killed this is an idea
that

305
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,379
that that pervades lots of

306
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:07,379
religious or the doctrines not just
uh...

307
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,659
the second thing is

308
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:13,959
that this this idea that mind and body
or somehow separate

309
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,960
appeals to what is known as folk
psychology

310
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,880
that is

311
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,440
all of the kind of intuitively informal

312
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,330
all understanding of mine

313
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,400
that people carry around in their heads
before they take psyc one

314
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,210
homework large so i won

315
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,630
although and discredited to it of
understanding of mine

316
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,530
basically says that we have parties and
we are mines

317
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,850
and bodies and minds are salmo how
different

318
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,039
that's what they card

319
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,940
that would cause that's what comes to a
sort of uh...

320
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,430
descartes so substance to elizabeth
there somehow different

321
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,990
and also that mind and body interact
somehow

322
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,290
that's where we get

323
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:56,280
creepy asian all interactive dualism
'cause it's obvious called that they do

324
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,640
and then finally

325
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,070
all in scientific psychology as it began
to develop in the nineteenth century

326
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,870
well into the twentieth century

327
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,060
uh... we have this idea

328
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,780
basic cartesian

329
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,620
dualism

330
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:14,130
is relative is preserved at what's known
as the doctrine of mental listen

331
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,000
and the dot doc about was the basically
says

332
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,209
that mental states part to action

333
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:23,000
as close to affect

334
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,840
that it's not the it's our mental states
or believe in something

335
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,830
or perceiving something or feeling
something or wanting something

336
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,130
that causes us

337
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,960
to do what we do that causes us to
behave of the world

338
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,090
when we do

339
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,850
somehow what's goin through our minds

340
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,729
causes us to behaved with our bodies

341
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:49,670
all of the way we do but what's
important

342
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,980
or mental state

343
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,279
that are causing behavior to to occur

344
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,389
and all this culminates basically

345
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,300
id william james definition of
psychology as well

346
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,760
as the science of mental life

347
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,640
stroll

348
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,010
descartes some

349
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,670
dualism or something like day cards to
elizabeth very very very appealing to

350
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,460
people on almost everybody in this room
i'm sure agrees that he or she has a

351
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,010
mind

352
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,870
james that what's important for the
weekend argue about right

353
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,259
palm

354
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:27,790
what you do with that mind is that or
what you think if you do with that

355
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,770
binder so that it was something
different

356
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,000
most people have this intuition

357
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,340
that mind and body or somehow different

358
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,130
when you start thinking about it
seriously as descartes with other people

359
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,769
did

360
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,470
you begin to think

361
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,529
heart that their that that that that
that

362
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:46,270
there's a real problem

363
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,379
this idea that mind and body or somehow
different

364
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,069
but still somehow interact

365
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:52,840
how could that possibly be

366
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,889
uh...

367
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,480
the case

368
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,430
people worried about this a lot

369
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,740
fall and this is not a course in the
history of philosophy were only going to

370
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,230
do this for one day with any luck will
do it for a little bit less than a day

371
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,120
are but just to try to give you an idea
about what people other how people try

372
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,500
to get out of what i called descartes
impasse

373
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,290
that's not through the two ritual

374
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,460
home uh... that is the idea of

375
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,640
mind about your somehow different than
the interact somehow we can figure out

376
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,690
what they do

377
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:26,180
so you get somebody like nicholas mala
branches as well here's the solution to

378
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,740
the problem

379
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,820
turns out

380
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:34,049
that paul causal power right looked like
a real resides with god

381
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,800
all and so what happens is that

382
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,440
when something moves in the world

383
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,840
that's the occasion for god to put into
the mind of the observer the perception

384
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,150
of the movies object

385
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,850
called and when are

386
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,470
when somebody archive thinks about
raising his right hand

387
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,410
that's the occasion for god to make the
right

388
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,940
all rate

389
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,750
that's not a particularly satisfactory

390
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,200
uh... the solution mind-body problem i
think

391
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,880
but it did get mala brushed tenure

392
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,350
and then aquila dot along all along the
way says those welded thereto brooks for

393
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,969
those who says look

394
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,580
all of the l minded body are very
different

395
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,220
all of their true dyed a different
properties of reality okayed two

396
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,850
different

397
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,910
features of reality

398
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,210
and all my dead body are connected

399
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,080
because

400
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,250
god says

401
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,309
that mind and body or connected

402
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,650
godward games this isomorphism sort of
whatever goes through your mind paul

403
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,909
although dissolved has its cover part of
what goes on

404
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:43,409
goes on the world and whatever goes on
in the world has withheld report

405
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:45,810
and something that goes on through your
mind

406
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,730
and then got for you don't know why this

407
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,570
articulates what

408
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,850
seems to be the favorite solution

409
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,800
or from a duelist at point of view

410
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,150
which is of the human element
psychophysical parallelism

411
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,240
which basically says

412
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,650
there's a relationship

413
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,230
that all about what goes on intervened
in the physical world

414
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,330
and what goes on in the all of that has
its parallel did what goes on in the

415
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,100
mind and vice versa

416
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,040
and that correlation is simply
established by god

417
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,830
so what

418
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,270
well why did basically says is work
there is a relationship

419
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,080
between mind and body

420
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,720
and on the way it works is god does it

421
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,530
that was no more satisfactory to anybody
that many of these other all of them

422
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,410
kinds of solution

423
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,710
than people realize that pretty quickly

424
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,970
and they tried some other ways pub

425
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,030
getting out

426
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,000
okay cards

427
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,990
palm

428
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,130
sulfur example george barkley bishop
barkley after who berkeley's name

429
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,120
uh... had this idea that workers

430
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,250
filled when the way to get out of doing
a lot of the problem of dualism said

431
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,090
there's only one thing

432
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,690
what part we did was to work hard

433
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,929
for mine

434
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:57,809
and he said well before the there's
really only reality as the law in

435
00:19:57,809 --> 00:19:58,650
perceives that

436
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,600
there's no physical world out there

437
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,880
palm uh... that's

438
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,350
not of particularly

439
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,620
satisfactory solution either but that's
what the

440
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,720
that's when it came up with

441
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,250
and in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries an american

442
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,040
or psychologists and psychiatrists

443
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,430
wharton prince

444
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,549
arca above the plugin solved

445
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:24,669
all of the problem of symbolism again
kind of like barkley

446
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:27,720
with what he called the mine stuff
theory

447
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,840
here's the relationship between mind and
body

448
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,759
all matter

449
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,140
containers

450
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,750
thing cold minus stuff

451
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,680
and if you get in

452
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,460
not for this matter

453
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,120
dogma clump together

454
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,610
then you've got a lot of mind stopping
to get a mine

455
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,820
if you don't have a lot of the stuff
clump together that you don't have

456
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,740
enough mine stuff to give rise to mind
so you don't have a life

457
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,200
he got tenure for this true

458
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,970
stalling

459
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,870
picked up the door directed the harvard
founded and directed the harvard

460
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,500
psychological clinic and establish the
journal of abnormal psychology which is

461
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,909
published to this day

462
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:09,100
with william james his best friend

463
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,770
arms are going to be really was a very
important on the guy

464
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,890
i mean who seems kinda silly to wants
now

465
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,810
though of if u reddog john swirls i'll
review of

466
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,910
david chalmers

467
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,029
on you'll see

468
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:28,429
now actually chalmers is an idea that
experience is a fundamental feature of

469
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:28,960
matter

470
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,510
is not all that different

471
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,700
for almost all of the of the word
princes idea that all better contains a

472
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,210
little bit of mine stuff

473
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,730
but any ways some people tried to escape

474
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,460
the problems of cartesian dualism

475
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,450
by going

476
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,840
or for mine

477
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,240
basically saying that you know there is
no of the matter doesn't matter

478
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,550
barkley said at one of them very clearly

479
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,840
on here that's the kind of a version of
what's known in

480
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,299
in materialist borders of that is is
only one kind of thing

481
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,510
and it's mine

482
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,740
where uh...

483
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,290
artwork princess at all matter contains

484
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:06,820
of somali someone so there's really no
difference between them

485
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,240
more popular were also at the center for
the heart of palm palm

486
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,450
with the philosophical views dot org
that

487
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,350
who've come to a says known as
materialist bonanza

488
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,930
previous guy say there is only one kind
of thing

489
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,400
and its matter

490
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,630
all of them mind is just kind of out of
the picture

491
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,410
get this in the eighteenth century in
france julia cooperate they love met re

492
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,670
all proposes what's known as the
automaton theory

493
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,900
that basically says

494
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,429
humans have consciousness

495
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:42,800
salem entry was a good divided humans
consciousness

496
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,100
but he says

497
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,039
consciousness really just doesn't matter
all up to behavior

498
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,890
we are automata joyous like all other
avenues

499
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,520
it's just that we happen to have
consciousness

500
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,379
song

501
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:57,200
and uh... so

502
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,429
the problem here

503
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:03,419
that this resolves the mind-body problem
chris you no longer have to worry about

504
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:07,670
howled thoughts affect behavior

505
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:13,070
you don't have to worry about how some
of them something like a mental state

506
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,970
the real physical world because it turns
out that consciousness has no effect

507
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,830
on the real physical world

508
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,880
automata over reflex machines just like
the rest of of metering

509
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,320
and then on thomas huxley

510
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,420
although it's not

511
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,400
basically put pulls us all together

512
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,510
with his doctrine of at the phenomenal
isn't

513
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,380
thomas huxley was darwin's cause and

514
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,180
uh... tubes called darwin's bulldog uses
really vigorous proponent

515
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,910
of the theory of evolution

516
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,240
uh... which is not a bad thing all but

517
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,740
u_s_-led uh... thought to articulate
this doctrine

518
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,890
that basically

519
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,860
did just like the elementary

520
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,529
we guess we have consciousness

521
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:01,570
but consciousness plays no haldol ruled
the world

522
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,370
all we have our brains

523
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:09,690
and brains receive stimulus inputs that
brains execute response outputs

524
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,860
and that's just the way it is

525
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,590
called consciousness is nothing more

526
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,940
this team of the whistle

527
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,160
alone

528
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,000
using a steam engine analogy

529
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,020
uh... it's not even the whistle of the
west's wants the scheme of the whistle

530
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,690
it just doesn't do anything

531
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,390
battle

532
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,479
so bizarre ways in which people

533
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:36,940
when none of us would have happened
really had ulm cargo descartes not

534
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,909
argued convincingly onto a lot of people

535
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:44,749
that in mind and body were somehow
different yet mind and body somehow

536
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:45,240
interacted

537
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,360
all these guys are trying to figure out

538
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,179
how to respond onto this

539
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:53,020
to this general position

540
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,710
james for his part

541
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,860
basically said that the booth at the end
of the nineteenth century all these

542
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,650
positions have been articulated

543
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,220
and james carville kind of looks at me
says

544
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,950
i really liked working a lot but the
buying stuff theory can't be right

545
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,880
right it's just not

546
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,610
finally takes an entire chapter of the
principles volvo arguing very gently

547
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,220
that it's just a coup

548
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,169
idea

549
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:19,820
on james james who trained as a position

550
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,880
on his very interested biology says look

551
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,590
materialism is right

552
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,830
there's only one kind of substance

553
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:33,690
in the world of those of the physical
substances all we know

554
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,410
rejected

555
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,230
what seemed to be the logical
consequence of that assumption

556
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,919
who rejected the automaton theories that
were not tommorow

557
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:45,930
already rejected up a phenomenal izumi
says

558
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,410
it's obvious that it was obvious to him

559
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,740
that mental states have allen had causal
efficacy so it would just have to

560
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,470
but with that

561
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,550
what what one must be the case

562
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,950
is that there is some kind of cycle
physical parallel

563
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:06,029
there must be some correspondence
between what goes on in our minds

564
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:08,630
and what goes through our brains

565
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,460
okay

566
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,790
it's not our correspondence that's
established by god it's a secular

567
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,350
version of psychophysical parallelism

568
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,650
all but uh... it's just that that's all
we can do

569
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,480
james says he just kind of throws up his
head

570
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,070
ensign says that's of that that's the
best i could do

571
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,080
or maybe

572
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,870
as psychology develops poem of the boys
will be able to do better than that will

573
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,490
be able to

574
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,149
i figure out exactly

575
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:34,850
how the psychophysical parallelism
occurs

576
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,230
but he says i can't do it

577
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:40,130
we just don't know what

578
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,080
so that takes us to the end of the
nineteenth century

579
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,350
and then what happens is people start
responding part two

580
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,720
to james

581
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,120
on john b watson

582
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,880
of founder of a also charter school in
psychology known as behavior resum

583
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,920
basically takes

584
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,970
the automaton theory and be although
that and the view of epa phenomenal ism

585
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,960
which came through blossom p

586
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,059
and in bed sit

587
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:09,640
in the heart in psychology about the
plots of actually dividing us

588
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,370
that psychology is the science of mental
life

589
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,890
he says look

590
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,690
covers right

591
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,120
you really can't have a science in
psychology if you're going to study the

592
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,190
mind

593
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,110
hongkong

594
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,809
for all of you probably do

595
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,190
is to have a science

596
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,010
that studies behavior

597
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,220
and the conditions

598
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,640
under which it occurs

599
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,480
because that's the whole you could
describe objectively

600
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,010
the only thing that you could

601
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,140
scientifically observe

602
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:39,070
the only thing you can scientifically
study on his behavior

603
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,260
which is publicly observable

604
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,319
and the environmental conditions under
which it occurred

605
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,250
which is publicly

606
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,730
uh... observable

607
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,470
and he says although

608
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,440
and the but then he goes what one step
further he says look

609
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,260
throughout these guys are right

610
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,590
mental states simply

611
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,680
have any causal efficacy they don't

612
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,900
do anything

613
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,630
we have them we understand we have them

614
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:04,740
all bob what really goes on here

615
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,380
is that all behaving organisms whether
your work for a cruel were more awful

616
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,779
leisure or wrong

617
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:12,860
wrapped worldwide or if you would be

618
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,760
all behaving organisms or simply
reacting

619
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,129
to informant told

620
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,400
uh... stimulus

621
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,260
newspaper stands

622
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,460
then you can have

623
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,100
a natural science in psychology

624
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,640
but as long as you know fault but that's
what you're going to let some kind of

625
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,840
metaphysical idea like bahrain

626
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,190
some kind of the material minders from
minded

627
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,530
somehow different

628
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,679
promo the full body into your size

629
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:40,620
you're never going to get anywhere

630
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,879
so what we want to do

631
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:45,360
is simply learn how we can predict
behavior

632
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,130
which is something that we can as we
were to predict behavior we advance

633
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,410
our scientific theories halt

634
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,780
about behaviors

635
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,510
not about the line

636
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,679
palm and week that we can use our
scientific knowledge

637
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,779
to promote human welfare

638
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:04,169
by controlling the behavior hall felt
people based on these kinds of

639
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:05,550
scientific principle

640
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,729
so what will be dealt with the
behaviorist revolution

641
00:29:08,729 --> 00:29:11,650
really is fall an attempt to kind of

642
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,060
roldo mind out

643
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,540
of the discipline

644
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,370
and what you'll see if this becomes

645
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,030
very popular really fast

646
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,790
and in the nineteen twenties the
nineteen thirties and go back and you

647
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,549
won't you you well

648
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:24,990
start star reading

649
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,330
the old scientific journals and
psychology you see two things happening

650
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,320
very quickly

651
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,620
the first is federal references to
mental life dropped almost completely

652
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,029
out of the picture

653
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:40,790
pass on a psychologist dot don't the
don't talk about

654
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,799
memory and perception

655
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,590
uh... andy walker

656
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,460
all the talk about behavior

657
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,309
on the talk about stimulus control
behavior

658
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:52,180
and the other thing that happens

659
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,820
part of the at this time which really
hadn't happened before it looks like all

660
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,410
of the store to we've had a ball
research to the exclusion of human

661
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,420
research

662
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,060
on watson said lots ok word rust animals

663
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,080
so uh... all that you can take your rats
in your bookings of your cats in your

664
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,530
dogs that you could do perfectly good
psychology

665
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,950
uh... it doesn't matter that your
subjects could no longer tell you about

666
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,830
your about their mental state

667
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,020
cause their mental states don't mean
anything

668
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,570
all that means anything

669
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,919
his behavior

670
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,240
and the circumstances under which it
occurred

671
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,820
the third interesting thing

672
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,200
that happens about this time let's not
just like colleges for collect a lot

673
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,200
like this

674
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,230
by the way trouble what's himself pre
quickly dropped out of psychology

675
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,520
he had uh...

676
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,280
he had a romantic entanglements with a
graduate student and they didn't like

677
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,860
that at johns hopkins have

678
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,170
on the keep them out

679
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:56,470
uh... and he went to work for auto
advertising agency

680
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,420
great contribution to civilization
decides

681
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,960
the invention behavior as a

682
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,159
he invented the coffee break

683
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:10,980
he'd he divides the concept of the
mid-morning to mid afternoon coffee

684
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,540
break as a way of selling coffee

685
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,350
for our client was advertising agents

686
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:22,139
before john watson for job you want to
be did not have coffee breaks

687
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:23,210
after him

688
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,930
we have starbucks and everything that
goes with it right is all

689
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,100
called for the

690
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,100
considerable consequence

691
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,750
what's about the which he answer

692
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,379
okay but the other thing that happened
to your in fact called art

693
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:42,990
this same kind of of the same kind of
idea

694
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,990
all we really have his behavior and mind
width really doesn't play any kind of

695
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,820
role of the role of it

696
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,690
although it appears and all

697
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,119
but the appears in philosophy as well

698
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:59,159
you can see it and all of the famous saw
other treatise by gilbert rile british

699
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:01,770
philosopher called the concept of mine

700
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,619
in which he's three describes

701
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:07,590
although the mind is just the ghost in
the machine that's where though

702
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,050
please so i think it was got the title
of their album

703
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,490
home ando

704
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,359
it does look

705
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,849
it's just a mistake

706
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:20,670
to think about mind as somehow separate

707
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,890
on him it's you know that

708
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,849
it's even a mistake to think about mind
is a physical part of the body

709
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:28,160
blind dosent really exists

710
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,259
all that exists

711
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:31,670
for bodies

712
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:35,260
when we think about mind what we've
really mean

713
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,440
behavior

714
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,630
or at least disposition

715
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,190
the behavior

716
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,040
paula and that's really all we can say
about it because it's just out of his

717
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,560
writing

718
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,679
thirty years after john b watson

719
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,530
uh... and uh... just

720
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,960
tho exactly the same kind of idea
fizzled when we refer to

721
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,950
when we talk about

722
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,430
all mental states

723
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,980
we refer to we were really referring to
one of two different things

724
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,059
first were just referring to behavior

725
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:06,530
were referring to

726
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:10,020
the circumstances for using mental power

727
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,790
so what i say i m

728
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,740
hungry

729
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,140
what i really mean is it's been awhile
since breakfast and it's getting on

730
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,620
towards lunch

731
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,299
if i say i'm sleepy

732
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,289
what it really what i really mean is

733
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:26,950
it's been a little while since theater
and it's getting on towards

734
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,679
jay leno time or something like that

735
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,530
really i'm just referring to

736
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,840
all behavior in the circumstances

737
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,419
uh... under which it occurs

738
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:38,590
which is exactly what watson had said

739
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,480
psychology wada confine itself to

740
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,830
uh... as a deal

741
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,810
as a science of mental life

742
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,759
sobel begat

743
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:52,759
is in addition to the psychological
behavior ism

744
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,840
davis

745
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,149
a tradition

746
00:33:56,149 --> 00:34:01,009
all philosophical behavior ism that
really translates mental blood that was

747
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:02,050
the terms

748
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:05,890
into arm into the behavior

749
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:09,129
you actually see these guys postal but
what do you mean by thinking

750
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:13,359
well what i mean by thinking is talking
to myself

751
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,689
okay that's behavior

752
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:17,860
and are there was a tradition of the man

753
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,479
putting electrode people for a
productive

754
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:22,159
think of thought

755
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,129
on the purity of that their vocal
apparatus moved while they

756
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:29,679
fought thoughtfully but go they were
thinking out loud to think that behavior

757
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,089
thinking particulates just behavior

758
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:34,050
if you believe something

759
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,660
that's not a mental state

760
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:41,189
wud believing something means is
behaving as if it's true

761
00:34:41,189 --> 00:34:45,089
so quite believe in god i go to church
and behaving as if there's a god

762
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:48,889
if i believe it's raining outside i
carry an umbrella line behaving as if

763
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:53,919
it's raining outside and solid believing
doesn't mean anything are more than that

764
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,159
all the medical terms that we have
believing feeling knowing wanting all

765
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,089
that stuff

766
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:01,439
can be translated either into

767
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:03,010
something that refers to

768
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,339
overt behavior

769
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:08,009
for two the circumstances hall under
which

770
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:12,670
which it occurs

771
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,879
philosophical behavior ism

772
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:18,719
i think it all confines of the apex
caught in the hong denote viewpoint

773
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,120
within philosophy

774
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,719
that essentially denies the
consciousness

775
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:25,929
dogs exist all

776
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:30,049
loan there are floss words out there who
say they see it's a delusion

777
00:35:30,049 --> 00:35:32,380
kind of a version of that the phenomenal
ism

778
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,130
with old even if you could be a puff
anomalous thought

779
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,109
the consciousness was really just that

780
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:39,049
part of the product id

781
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,819
but consciousness doesn't really exist

782
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:46,660
and the basis for this is a stance came
they came to be associated with

783
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,699
approval for suffers or at the end

784
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:53,220
who are conducted a stance known as
positivism

785
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,869
is worth watching cold logical part of
this

786
00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:02,179
which basically said that nothing exists
that can't be publicly verified

787
00:36:02,179 --> 00:36:04,989
okay that's what that's a

788
00:36:04,989 --> 00:36:10,420
of positivism nothing exists that can't
be publicly verified if it exists

789
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:16,130
it can be publicly verified if it
doesn't exist it can't he publicly

790
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,239
verified

791
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:20,389
and of the idea of the idea here is of
course that

792
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:23,489
because consciousness been heralded
subjective

793
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:25,849
because it's inherently private

794
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:27,550
can't be publicly verified

795
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:30,099
and therefore it doesn't really exist

796
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,690
you will see

797
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,449
home strains of this

798
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:37,969
again and also a professor so roles
review of debt bennett's book

799
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:39,040
consciousness explained

800
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,489
or dented essentially takes us

801
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:43,049
first of all quali a

802
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:46,160
uh... and on the second about
consciousness in general

803
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,619
it basically says

804
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:51,140
well have to book it says consciousness
doesn't exist with

805
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,410
publicly verified

806
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,410
and in the other half of what he
identifies consciousness with certain

807
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,599
functions

808
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,140
the other aspect o behaviors

809
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,109
but all these guys

810
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:02,950
basically argue

811
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,640
that consciousness is irrelevant to
function we may have it

812
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,670
but it's basically up a phenomenal it
doesn't play and he called the wall

813
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,259
uh... in anything

814
00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:14,300
all we've got is a brain

815
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,070
which operates as a kind of virtual
machine

816
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,209
all turn taken over from computer
science

817
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:22,670
that processes stimulus inputs

818
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,399
and generates response of with

819
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:28,319
basically

820
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:31,499
now some people like this viewpoint

821
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,009
most people to help like this viewpoint

822
00:37:34,009 --> 00:37:38,779
are is i think that's just doesn't sound
right to be some out

823
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:43,279
reasoner doesn't celebrate you is
because were also you back at the cards

824
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:44,410
impasse

825
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,769
we all share this notion

826
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:49,570
blinded somehow special

827
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,210
somehow different from body

828
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,880
mind and body interacts

829
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,809
well we don't have the foggiest idea how
we do it

830
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:01,929
and the f_a_a_'s the reviews and the
responses to the reviews on the

831
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:03,619
responses to the responses of

832
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:05,119
uh... to the reviews

833
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,450
yeah better collected and all updated
professor sural orc i think if you are

834
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,429
really good

835
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:14,229
idea

836
00:38:14,229 --> 00:38:19,660
hollow people are trying to grapple

837
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,109
forward with his idea

838
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:22,999
that comes to us from the car

839
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:24,289
that bind the body

840
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:26,029
or somehow difference

841
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:27,759
but somehow incorrect

842
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:32,759
and how that could possibly

843
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:36,879
were all sitting piping still one
hundred twenty years after james his

844
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:37,619
principles

845
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,939
city most of us anyway

846
00:38:39,939 --> 00:38:44,099
mobile call james's conundrum

847
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:46,349
forces us to materialism

848
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:48,870
we all adopt a scientific worldview

849
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,760
now that there's no physical world out
there in it can be understood to be

850
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,410
cadavers science based on measurement
and public knowledge

851
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,369
and all of that kind of stuff

852
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,589
science forces osprey which will listen

853
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:02,229
of experience

854
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:05,080
nevertheless inclined to the student
will listen

855
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,519
which is the idea that somehow

856
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,839
mind is different

857
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:10,009
that body

858
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:12,930
and that's all some there's some kind of
mystery

859
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,919
about first

860
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:18,439
how bottle we process these could give
rise to mental states

861
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,679
but you know that's not so much of a
mystery but didn't bother the at the

862
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,870
phenomenal is in the nineteenth century

863
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,039
baba lee

864
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,059
start processes could give rise to
mental state

865
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:29,950
what really bothers people

866
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,859
is the idea

867
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:32,869
mental state

868
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:36,219
could play uphold the wall

869
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:36,729
world

870
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:38,910
so now what you see in though

871
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,699
boxgrove reviewed by several

872
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:42,400
there's a bunch of responses

873
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,890
onto the soul of the situation

874
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,619
some people just want to give up on
folks psychology

875
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:48,609
they are right

876
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:51,939
you know they're right let's not talk
about mind anymore

877
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:52,669
alm

878
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:53,970
or they go

879
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:57,300
for some kind of god reduction this
materialism

880
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,159
that basically denies that you could

881
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:04,310
org conscious states have a lot of pavel
material basis

882
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,340
but you can't reduced

883
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,769
consciousness

884
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:09,910
uh... material functions

885
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:13,999
or you get a blend of materialism and
dualism to get people to save the assets

886
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:17,330
right were all scientists now we're all
material is now

887
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:24,259
but still

888
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:25,129
palm

889
00:40:25,129 --> 00:40:27,239
there because some people will really it
was just

890
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:29,799
three-day car got it right the first
time

891
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:32,429
are the okay to set aside the god part

892
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,299
are part of the basically got it right

893
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:36,920
um... we didn't bring some kind of
dualism

894
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,479
and then there are people who just say

895
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,119
i give up

896
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,499
i can't deal with us now

897
00:40:43,499 --> 00:40:45,700
on and this is in fact the position

898
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,829
are cold mister realism

899
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:50,890
are that's associated with our colin
began

900
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,440
all who basically said

901
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,450
we've been trying for a long time to
solve the mind-body problem

902
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,520
nobody has helped

903
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,849
funniest idea how to solve the mind-body
problem

904
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:03,799
all and all that and a says

905
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:05,479
we just can't do it

906
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:10,789
we don't have the cognitive capacity to
solve the mind-body problem

907
00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:12,999
all of these that we know

908
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:15,000
that materialism is right

909
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,239
science

910
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:17,699
inclined to storage

911
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:22,969
materialism ok are but we simply cannot
figure out

912
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:24,770
mahalo on top of the how it works

913
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,910
and we're never going to be able to
figure out

914
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,019
how it works

915
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:30,459
and that the note that this is not just
uh...

916
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:33,620
the kind of a accounts of the strange
idea for home

917
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,079
for rome

918
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:37,799
for permitting the basis of what

919
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:42,079
developmental psychology teaches us that
there were certain things that we're

920
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,089
simply not capable of understanding at a
particular time

921
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:49,609
beget all begin with actually base in
this idea on p o_j_'s notion that there

922
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:52,479
were stages of cognitive development

923
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:55,039
andy's of what

924
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,349
the result there are some things i don't
know that child with a pre operational

925
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,219
stage a cloud of development just can't
get

926
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:05,029
and you don't understand at all until
you move to the next stage of cognitive

927
00:42:05,029 --> 00:42:06,969
development and is that what we're stuck

928
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:11,900
uh... at a particular staging trodden
uh... development that basically

929
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,719
prevents us from understanding

930
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:16,230
of uh... uh... the relationship between

931
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,100
mind and body

932
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,160
we are cut off by our very cognitive
constitution

933
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,059
from what she did a conception

934
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:24,919
of the psychophysical link

935
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:27,120
uh... so we don't worry about this what
we want

936
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,309
but nobody's ever gonna be able to

937
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:32,609
we're going to be able to solve it

938
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:34,130
and that we get people like

939
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,259
i'll put my professor's sorrow

940
00:42:36,259 --> 00:42:40,599
hall who has this really interesting
waved at the those who've taken paula

941
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,249
paula dot of course from professors who
are already of his books

942
00:42:44,249 --> 00:42:48,949
know that he has harvests or way of just
kind of

943
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:51,339
all allot of uh...

944
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:52,169
intellectual

945
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:54,319
detritus

946
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:57,139
these as well

947
00:42:57,139 --> 00:43:02,189
the only reason we have a mind-body
problem is because

948
00:43:02,189 --> 00:43:06,150
reread take heart

949
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,509
fog and descartes says that there are
minds and bodies at the paris somehow

950
00:43:10,509 --> 00:43:13,379
different but they don't buy the but
they interact

951
00:43:13,379 --> 00:43:16,370
and descartes just made this fundamental
mistake

952
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,280
which was to think of mind and body has
sold

953
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,630
how different is that they're just not

954
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:24,229
is that the way to solve the mind-body
problem

955
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:25,779
is to say

956
00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:31,140
mind is what the brain dogs

957
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,650
consciousness is a causal property of
the parade that something that grill

958
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,969
tissue produces

959
00:43:35,969 --> 00:43:39,999
in the same way that the stomach
produces digestion and stuff like that

960
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:41,799
is just really no different

961
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:43,969
all of them from that

962
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:46,669
at certain levels of anatomical
organization

963
00:43:46,669 --> 00:43:48,079
we know

964
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,489
at the level represented by the human
brain

965
00:43:51,489 --> 00:43:53,550
brahma believe primate brains

966
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,569
maybe other mammalian brains

967
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:56,800
maybe not

968
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,919
invertebrate brains but maybe

969
00:43:58,919 --> 00:44:02,059
at certain levels about a public
organization

970
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:03,749
neural tissue gives rise

971
00:44:03,749 --> 00:44:05,619
uh... that the consciousness

972
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:06,650
but only

973
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,139
when that

974
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:09,229
neural structure

975
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,280
isn't certain kinds of physiological
states so if you're

976
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,850
going in for surgery in your put under
our played of general anesthesia

977
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,789
you're not conscious anymore

978
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:20,839
along to fall asleep you're not
conscious anymore if somebody could to

979
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:22,979
over the head with a frying pan

980
00:44:22,979 --> 00:44:25,589
xox about you're not conscious anymore

981
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:28,729
on menu somehow yukon your your

982
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:32,529
that physiology apartment comes back and
produces

983
00:44:32,529 --> 00:44:33,600
that's alright

984
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,900
okay now what's not all that it's
because uh... so relax you pics of mind

985
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,179
is very important

986
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:42,869
the argues that the mind-body problem is
essentially

987
00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:44,259
not a problem at all

988
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:46,499
there's a problem for better prepared to
was

989
00:44:46,499 --> 00:44:52,799
only because we adopted this basic uh...
the space of cartesian step

990
00:44:52,799 --> 00:44:54,619
and then finally

991
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:56,079
we get

992
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,710
people who are overly influenced

993
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,110
vault of the body of

994
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,499
find neuroscience

995
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:05,430
who want to who want to argue again as

996
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,119
walks and might have

997
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,649
as the philadelphia philosophical
behavior is sort of like

998
00:45:11,649 --> 00:45:15,239
that are somehow all-girl sciences going

999
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:18,339
of themselves solve these problems

1000
00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:20,579
what what happens is

1001
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:26,059
or real problem is that we insist on
talking about things like

1002
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,649
all pauline patricia churchill and

1003
00:45:28,649 --> 00:45:32,899
all have argued for what about the
status of the call interfere rather

1004
00:45:32,899 --> 00:45:36,569
reduction which says basically but we
need to do is to get rid of folks like

1005
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:37,339
ology

1006
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:41,880
we always talk about all i believe in
this or i want that arrived i'd leave

1007
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,569
that

1008
00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:44,629
the head of the people problem is that

1009
00:45:44,629 --> 00:45:46,819
you know we keep talking about

1010
00:45:46,819 --> 00:45:50,709
folks like a logical concepts that we
think explain our behavior but they

1011
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,739
don't really explain her behavior

1012
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:54,299
what explains our behavior

1013
00:45:54,299 --> 00:45:56,289
are brain processes

1014
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:57,849
and they argue

1015
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:00,730
organ for this position called interfere
reddick reduction

1016
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:04,320
by which they said we really want to get
rid of all this folks psychology

1017
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,049
and talk about the things that really
matters

1018
00:46:07,049 --> 00:46:09,930
when the proposition two principal of a
new theory

1019
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:13,710
mirror the proposition two principles of
the board theory and the new theory

1020
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:17,289
gives better explanation predictions of
the old one

1021
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:20,390
the new theory contains the correct

1022
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:21,979
description all reality

1023
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:25,700
it is to be preferred

1024
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,709
and their basic idea here is that brain
science

1025
00:46:29,709 --> 00:46:31,239
constitutes a new theory

1026
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:34,969
that gives you better explanations have
better predictions

1027
00:46:34,969 --> 00:46:36,259
folks like ology

1028
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:37,770
and that weren't we should start

1029
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,249
all of them we should start doing that

1030
00:46:40,249 --> 00:46:41,910
never really very quite

1031
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:42,910
white dog

1032
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,380
quite serious about this lived alone

1033
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,539
further folk psychology talks about
mental states of believing that wont

1034
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:51,379
even

1035
00:46:51,379 --> 00:46:52,809
real science

1036
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,739
term they use real science

1037
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:56,809
talks about

1038
00:46:56,809 --> 00:46:58,149
physical states

1039
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,509
therefore and here's a quote

1040
00:47:00,509 --> 00:47:05,369
psychology must be grounded in the real
world findings of girl's life

1041
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:08,139
the implication being

1042
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:12,059
the world of folk psychology the world
of consciousness the world of mental

1043
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:12,650
life

1044
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,839
is not some call the real world

1045
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:21,550
the world on the line is the world of
hall of uh... non-existent things like

1046
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:22,199
easter

1047
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:24,950
uh... which we now know doesn't exist

1048
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:27,809
largest on which we now know doesn't
exist

1049
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:30,829
fairies which we know no don't exist
because we got up

1050
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:33,649
because a better science now

1051
00:47:33,649 --> 00:47:35,049
here they are

1052
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:36,049
palm

1053
00:47:36,049 --> 00:47:38,959
they are really quite serious about this
there was an article about them in the

1054
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,950
new yorker couple years ago

1055
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:44,799
of which uh... which showed that contain
both of them the following

1056
00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:49,829
the following episode polled pat comes
home o lived with her house for world

1057
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:50,789
one bb

1058
00:47:50,789 --> 00:47:52,300
and she says to me

1059
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,059
paul don't speak to me

1060
00:47:54,059 --> 00:47:58,910
by serotonin levels of hit bottom my
brain is awash in glucose steroids

1061
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:03,040
by blood vessels are full of adrenaline
and if it weren't for my end dodging the

1062
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,409
soviet side of driven the car into a
tree on the way home

1063
00:48:06,409 --> 00:48:09,789
my dopamine levels need lifting

1064
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:14,549
this is the scientific language that
they want to substitute for poke

1065
00:48:14,549 --> 00:48:15,120
psychology

1066
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,509
because this is grounded in the real
world findings of neuroscience

1067
00:48:19,509 --> 00:48:21,549
and not be in the

1068
00:48:21,549 --> 00:48:22,790
other worldly

1069
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:26,500
although abuse all blown salvo folks
like ology

1070
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,799
but noticed

1071
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:29,020
they actually came

1072
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:36,020
even even they can't pull this off
actually talk like that

1073
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:40,799
don't speak to me okay

1074
00:48:40,799 --> 00:48:44,280
that's what don't speak to me means that
the real world

1075
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,140
all about the cause of by means of
neuroscience right because this is now

1076
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,799
how we know what speaking there is
physically

1077
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:54,930
on them when she when she says poor
amiya chardonnay

1078
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:59,380
what she really means is put some
ethanol in water hog at at at at at at

1079
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,609
at a particular in a particular way

1080
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:06,719
home and and all of that right but
that's a bit that's that's kind of where

1081
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:09,699
this is going

1082
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:11,080
what's happening here

1083
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,030
is that

1084
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:15,469
guys are kinda missing the point

1085
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:17,619
this is a human interaction

1086
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:22,729
that is being mediated by people's
mental state

1087
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:24,490
wants something from pole

1088
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,150
okay

1089
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:26,840
she wants him to

1090
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,070
feel a little solicitous and give her
some space and poruri chardonnay

1091
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,400
not true bark choc

1092
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,209
she wants a chardonnay

1093
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:39,269
right why doesn't she just injected with
the both the boxing thomson or something

1094
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:41,139
like that

1095
00:49:41,139 --> 00:49:46,269
why did she talk to him at all

1096
00:49:46,269 --> 00:49:51,839
in the real world of social interaction
you know do stuff like this right

1097
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,869
i can talk to you right now forming a
glass of chardonnay i'm going to take a

1098
00:49:55,869 --> 00:49:59,189
bath and i'll be down in a little while
right

1099
00:49:59,189 --> 00:50:01,780
if it's an interaction that means
something

1100
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,790
something like this just kind of strips
the whole thing of its meaning

1101
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:08,939
unless you have your

1102
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:12,519
video decoder ring

1103
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:17,089
that'll tell you what it means for some
way to save my brain is awash in glucose

1104
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:20,900
steroids what elements that name

1105
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,069
from no wonder you know what that means
right

1106
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:26,899
unless you can come in quick gota bhool
and and and and and and and what

1107
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:30,999
happened with the wikipedia

1108
00:50:30,999 --> 00:50:32,660
what really needs to happen

1109
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:38,190
is that we need to ground neuroscience
in the real world findings of psychology

1110
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,709
okay

1111
00:50:39,709 --> 00:50:41,979
psychology columns

1112
00:50:41,979 --> 00:50:47,169
but neuroscience only makes sense once
we've got the psychology right and i can

1113
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:51,509
give you more examples of this view
force me to all do it next week

1114
00:50:51,509 --> 00:50:53,749
it's really it's really true

1115
00:50:53,749 --> 00:50:56,839
that mural science is no

1116
00:50:56,839 --> 00:50:57,749
privileged

1117
00:50:57,749 --> 00:50:59,989
science

1118
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:01,659
without

1119
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:05,689
your own neuroscience you can still have
a science of mental life you can still

1120
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:09,819
talk about perception memories and
thoughts and feelings and do all the

1121
00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:11,910
things that psychologist drew

1122
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:16,029
without really goin inside the head to
find out how the brain does it

1123
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:20,449
but if you think about it for a second
without psychology

1124
00:51:20,449 --> 00:51:22,529
all you've got for neuroscience

1125
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:24,859
is the biology of neural function

1126
00:51:24,859 --> 00:51:28,789
you don't know anything about what the
brain is doing

1127
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:33,059
you'd be a good weekend doing their own
science the way we want to do it now

1128
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:35,840
hong kong dot unless you have some idea

1129
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:41,919
about what's going on at the mental
level of analysis

1130
00:51:41,919 --> 00:51:43,760
okay another diatribe

1131
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,590
next time we'll take up when i take to
be four different problems of the route

1132
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:50,900
having to do with the relationship
between body and mind

1133
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,329
thank you very much
