all

111
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,430

114
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,530

115
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,810
there is a really good

116
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,790

all published in nineteen ninety two

120
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,919
all for this course who used to have it
privately reprinted i can't do that

121
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,479

122
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,199
last time i looked on amazon there was
one use copy available for a hundred and

twenty eight dollars

124

poem so all of this kind of a
collector's item

125
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,190
all but part of what i didn't know what
mister was to scan it

126
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,639
and put it up on the course website

127
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,699
or if you want to extra resources on of

128

130
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,939
this is a terrific book

131
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,580

132
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,669

133
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:14,159

136
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:25,639
philosophical were less philosophical
treatises on consciousness

137
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,029

david chalmers or and others

138
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:31,550
all of the they'll be reading that

139
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,020
what they basically as the background to
the lectures condo o on the mind-body

140
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,659
problem

141
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:42,369
and then just to kind of take us a
little bit off the beaten track we're

142
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:43,759
going to read a novel

149
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:00,190
hall

150
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,129
that has its ups and downs

151
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:07,020
all but what lodged at a couple of years
ago was to write a novel based on all

152
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,499
basically doll doll debates about the
nature of consciousness

153
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:14,110
on and uh... as you'll see as the plot
progresses

154
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,619

informed interesting way

all of that you won't get all understand

158
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,419
finished with the course

159
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:30,650
on and it's just a terrific read

160
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,340
paul for those of you who care about
such things it does have a few erotic

161

in which we just ask you to contemplate

266
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,380
a particular question

267
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,430
about some aspect of consciousness

268
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,900

271
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,860
shouldn't be more than two hundred fifty
words

272
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,080
hong

273
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,630

day

277
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,600
all we want those things though

278
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,150
we want those things off

279
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,180
and their graded on a roller none

280
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,680
solved all the bases

281
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,220
so that if you

282
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,500
your response of

283
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,220
for the question posed

284
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,640
who say something

285
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,500
reasonable

286
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,750
and it's reasonably well written no
serious grammatical or spelling errors

287
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,709
or whatever

288
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,090
you get five points

289
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,510
if it's not reasonable

290
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,290
or it's all a grammatical and spelling
bass

291
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:16,719
alva

292
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,440
but uh... that's basically how that

293
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,090
uh... how that works for sid more about
that in a minute

294
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,220
grading policy there are twenty
twenty-five points available for the

295
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,060
class fifteen points for the midterm
hundred points from the alone

296
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,079
from the although the final

297
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,580
and then another seventy five points
from discussion section

298
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,380
all policy here is that all my classes

299
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,670
if you work in the late at least ninety
percent called for the available points

300
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,050
you're guaranteed some kind of a

301
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,200
if you accumulate eighty percent of the
available points are guaranteed some

302
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,580
kind of b

303
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,660
and if you get

304
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,240
one more than half the available points
you're guaranteed

305
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,190
some kind of see i do that

306
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,630
take the pressure off

307
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,590
some people are kind of experimenting
with of course that may not have all the

308
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,280
background of whatever

309
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,419
if you're living and breathing in and
relatively conscious yourself

310
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:08,880
you can accumulate

311
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,310
fifty one percent

312
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,490
all deal of the available points

313
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,730
oh so

314
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,770
everybody can get a day

315
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,910
if everybody

316
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,060
does that

317
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,150
all but in any event

318
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,930
that's uh... that's where that goes

319
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,640
okay there's of course website that i
think you know

320
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,870
find a very useful resource all for the
class you get that on b space

321
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,310
those of you who are enrolled or

your course lights one of which will say

328
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,480
psych one twenty nine

329

like one twenty nine

331
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,390
that's the way that goes

332
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,029
or click on that uh...

333
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:02,690
and you'll get to called or home page
the move

334
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,490
small looks like this

335
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,500
or without navigation bar

336
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,420
navigation bar down the left

337
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,780
and as you click through the navigation
bar you'll find a whole bunch of whole

338
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,570
bunch of different things

339
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,200

340
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,130
for the course syllabus

341
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,110

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,230
forum posting number ten has been
deleted

343
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,630

which is that it contains links to a
couple of all items on the reading list

347
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,400
the revenues to overthrow land the large

348
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,310
the course

349
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,959
but there is some topics that they don't
cover

350
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,810
uh... adequately

351
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,300
paula and for that

352
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,310

00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,530
resource

376
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,780
they're available free part three slides
per page

377

386
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,819
argued that uh...

387
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,130
in that time

388
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,470
so the lecture supplements contained all
br presentations of these lectures

389
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,089
but they also go far beyond the lectures

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:24,260
on to talk about other along with other
details expanded various ways

391

you know again few

392
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,190

396
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,990

available for this class

512
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,830

514
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,980
else's perspective

515
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,180
yeah yes you see election notes are
uh... org are generally pretty good

516
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,260
also like

517
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,620
undoubtedly do

518
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,490
i do recommend them

519
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:57,240
called paul send out some information
about how to subscribe to those

520
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,390
but they are available also listed under
cog side one oh two that's like one

521
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,100
twenty

522
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,710
will be confused about that

523
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,299
one of the reasons the scores have been
screened all the podcast it couldn't be

524
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:13,870
put up on the website for people outside
of berkeley

525
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,730
also with the uh... podcast will include

526
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,150
the slides

527
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,870
and whatever rhymes whatever i say in on
class about them so you can kind of fall

528
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,770
on

529
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,740
with the uh...

530
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,130
with the lectures

531
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,840
if you're seeing this class bid if your
ticket

532
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,030
byu in this course all as they are as a
web testing you're not enrolled

533
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,740
and you want to access to be space
website

534
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,060
you should

535
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,869
email me

536
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:40,140
all and all all of them

537
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,429
make those arrangements

538
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:43,200
send you back home

539
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
access information for the space

540
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,950
that typically goes into people's spam
folders

541
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,580
if you don't hear from me check your
spam folder

542
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,630
and they're a part of the out there

543
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,880
for that reason

544
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,140
people here in class if you've got
questions that he ask a question i call

545
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,650
on you

546
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,420
please

547
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:06,750
encourage me to repeat the question for
the benefit of at people and

548
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,090
who are on with the who were listening
to the scores

549
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:11,650
alm

550
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,660
that's something that

551
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,990
odd that that's a bit

552
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,360
very bad habit that i have a not
repeating questions when i'm asked

553
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,330
because i'd come at one of just

554
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,040
engage with the person who's uh...

555
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,000
and so on

556
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,520
although the talking to me

557
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,400
but for the benefit of the folks at home

558
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,100
useful for me to repeat the question

559
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,179
all motor christina bite

560
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:40,190
zara dinner she discovered that i have
uncovered

561
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,600
okay syllabus is pretty uh...

562
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,730
pretty straightforward and pretty oh
well organized any questions at all

563
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:52,730
about the organization format of the
course

564
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,560
will you be required to do work p_p_ not
for this class

565
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:04,260
all of the psychology department has a
research purchase a patient program

566
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,110
all up and the result

567
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,920
research for just a patient requirement

568
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,130
for some psychology classes

569
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,220
usually the higher almond classes

570
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,850
all but troubled

571
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,830
so far

572
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,859
not for this class

573
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:16,960
even though

574
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,080
there looks like a high drama class to
me

575
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,960
we just we don't quite

576
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,640
couple threshold

577
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:24,940
wrong

578
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,140
so anyway that's

579
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,540
stuff when it is

580
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,250
there are

581
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,010
one children bunches of experiments
however available on campus for people

582
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,580
to serve as say paid subjects

583
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,490
and i'd always encourage people to do
that

584
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,440
it's one it gets you

585
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,680
sign up money for a pizza sometimes

586
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
or happpy so

587
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,180
or a slice

588
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,930
but it's mostly forties

589
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,090
and uh... and interesting

590
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,860
anything else about

591
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:57,220
phil course itself

592
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,899
i've the policy on the waitlist assumes
that we will do our best to

593
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:03,690
got move people off the waitlist into
our

594
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,670
into the yard into the class

595
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,680
we have a couple of constraints

596
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,980
the first is that we need to give
priority to psychology and cognitive

597
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,220
science majors who are seniors and
juniors

598
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,800
and the reason we do that is that this
of course that fulfills

599
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,950
graduation requirements for those majors

600
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,390
every one of these people's way out of
what we want to have you here we'd keep

601
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,400
you here forever if we could

602
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,690
all but we know you want to get out of
here

603
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,670
we want to facilitate that process

604
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:39,010
folks yet

605
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,460
wiped off outside of that

606
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,540
will move people in again giving
preference to senior and junior non

607
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,880
majors this courses offered every other
year saw from the spring of odd numbered

608
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,190
years

609
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,960
also if you're a junior now you're not
going to get a chance to take it next

610
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,450
year

611
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,460
you really want to take at this

612
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,510
do juniors if we can move some
sophomores and freshman into uh... the

613
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,030
prerequisites that's fine

614
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,350
all will do everything we can to do that

615
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:08,330
into the courses through a discussion
section

616
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:12,990
so your weight lifter waitlisted for the
chorus waitlisted for a discussion

617
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,010
section

618
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,800
so for next week or so

619
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,850
you should go to the discussion section
for which you waitlisted

620
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,270
and see if there's room

621
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,410
now we've got to accommodate these
people who were

622
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,280
accidentally registered for the tuesday
discussion section we're gonna do that

623
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,179
first

624
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:30,830
all but there still should be some room

625
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,510
uh... in the course

626
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,510
especially after

627
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:37,470
i finished today's lecture or certainly
after monday's lecture half the people

628
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,930
will leave the room

629
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,809
so long to be plenty of room

630
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:44,830
i'm sure

631
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,510
palm we have a number of foreign
exchange students here called us those

632
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,390

646
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:28,840
not my voice

647
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,480
sol they'd spend some time talking about

648
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,790
what we're gonna talk about

649
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,570
consciousness basically has to do with
two things

650
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,290
it has to do first with

651
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,010
awareness

652
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,940
it has to do with monitoring ourselves
and our environment

653
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,080
by virtue of being conscious

654
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,060
world where

655
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,520
we're consciously aware of what's going
on all around us

656
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,530
what we're doing what events are
occurring in the world

657
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,549
by virtue of being conscious

658
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:00,640
word aware of the contents of our own
mines

659
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,350
but that's not all the wrist a
consciousness

660
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,220
consciousness has not to do with joss
monitoring but it also has to do with

661
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,270
controlling ourselves and our
environment

662
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:16,360
by virtue of consciousness we engage in
voluntary activities we deliberately we

663
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,770
consciously engage

664
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:23,079
in various kinds of behaviors better
intended to meet environmental demands

665
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:26,990
on and achieve our own or personal goals

666
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,480
monitoring and controlling or two
aspects of truth quite different aspects

667
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,810
of consciousness

668
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,970
but i think it can see how at least in
logical terms they're related to each

669
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,630
other if you're going to exercise
conscious control it's something they're

670
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,730
going to have to be consciously aware of
it first

671
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,740
you can't consciously control something
you're not consciously aware of

672
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,500
or insolvency in any event

673
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,270
alva but uh... still these are two
different aspects of consciousness we're

674
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,280
going to

675
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,990
going to pay attention to

676
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,450
in this course

677
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,610
the problem of consciousness was set for
us in the are guarded

678
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,230
seventeenth-century basically by floss
for renee descartes

679
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:11,309
all who took it upon himself to try to
figure out what could be known

680
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:16,850
simply by the application of logic the
adopted a stance to be called all of the

681
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,620
the political doubt

682
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,090
so i'm not going to believe anything
anybody tells me

683
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,130
on their start from first principles

684
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,529
and he discovered that there was one
thing he couldn't doubt

685
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:27,210
which was that

686
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,750
he was conscious

687
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,200
okay

688
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,259
but he was doubting

689
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:34,260
right so i'm doubting right so that's
one thing i can tell

690
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:34,809
called

691
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:37,120
and he came up with his famous old

692
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,390
all of the book but by virtue of the
fact that party the experience himself

693
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,690
as thinking

694
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,970
he understood you do you resent that

695
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:45,760
he at least

696
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,940
or exist that that's what could you tell
ever goes to means

697
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,980
i think

698
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,340
therefore i a m

699
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,570
a little bit later

700
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:57,400
he all of them change the formulation a
little bit to safely race project i was

701
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,460
alright i_t_n_ ma i think that thinks

702
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,729
and this idea

703
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:06,960
that human beings are characterized in
our humanity by conscious awareness

704
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,870
not just that we think perceive or
remember but that we're aware

705
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,370
of what we think and perceived remember
that were aware of what's going through

706
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,760
our minds

707
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,360
really

708
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,459
on shifted

709
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,750
the whole

710
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,350
alm

711
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,669
uh... list of rust before us a p

712
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:26,589
from problems of metaphysics and
problems of ethics to problems of a

713
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:29,270
pistol biology problems of knowledge

714
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:33,870
and to set the stage of for later a
scientific analyses of consciousness

715
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,740
trying to figure out what consciousness
is

716
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,350
where it comes from and what it's good
before

717
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,780
topics aboard try to assess uh... say
something about

718
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,520
in this class

719
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,500
in the beginning this historical
beginnings of psychology william james

720
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,390
great american

721
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,000
our psychologist

722
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,910
late nineteenth century

723
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,480
arthur tried to define the other
psychology in his textbook the

724
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,910
principles of psychology

725
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:04,450
psychology instance define psychology
has the science of mental like

726
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,429
first fact ross that for a psychologist

727
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:11,210
as for that matter it was for descartes

728
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,770
thinkin goes on

729
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,250
is trying to understand

730
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,070
how it is that were able to think and
proceed even remember and do all those

731
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,900
other things with our minds

732
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,400
wendy shortened the principles

733
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,150
to the briefer course he'd change his
definition a little bit all the way

734
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,920
that's very friendly to the goals of
this course

735
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,779
by saying that psychology

736
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:35,299
is the description and explanation of
states of consciousness as such

737
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:35,910
psychology

738
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:40,610
for james anyway tried to figure out
what consciousness is

739
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,700
where home

740
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,830
and where it comes from

741
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:48,610
now in fact there was consciousness in
psychology before james

742
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,000
psychology i'd thought that uh...
extracts itself from from philosophy

743
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,220
and becomes law and uh... an independent
science

744
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,720
on basically around problem solve all of
them

745
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,940
problems of consciousness

746
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,779
the very first psychologist for people
like that defied themselves as cycle

747
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:07,090
physicists

748
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,460
and they set for themselves a problem

749
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,780
art racine full links

750
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,520
tracing the correlations

751
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,850
between the physical properties are
various tamil aryan be environment and

752
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:23,710
the psychological properties of the
experiences to which those stimuli

753
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,629
gave rise so in a very real sense

754
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,710
the very first scientific psychology

755
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,780
or was

756
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,629
or an attempt

757
00:33:31,629 --> 00:33:35,640
to figure out the nature of of conscious
experience

758
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,950
a little bit later in the nineteenth
century

759
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,600
although a pioneering psychologists like
of the building won't

760
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,289
in germany and off

761
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:46,800
uh... you'd be pitcher or here in united
states

762
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,390
developed a retarded technique which
they called introspection

763
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,650
in which their subjects the subjects in
their experiments would try to describe

764
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,770
their

765
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,090
conscious states

766
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:01,350
as they were experiencing various kinds
of of stimuli

767
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,259
so what wouldn't into cheer would do

768
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:04,710
would be too will

769
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,880
manipulate some aspect on some stimulus
situation

770
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,069
and then all i ask people to describe

771
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:14,429
how they're conscious experiences of
they've changed

772
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,879
home philosophers

773
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,249
ogle used introspection who want to
explore consciousness long between

774
00:34:21,249 --> 00:34:22,799
before when temperature

775
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:25,069
although that came on the scene

776
00:34:25,069 --> 00:34:28,219
but offer void intention or the
difference

777
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:31,609
their introspection as were experimental
in nature

778
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:33,179
or the expert matter

779
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,539
was all of the manipulating the stimuli

780
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:37,710
by various ways

781
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,339
and there was some kind of quantitative
analysis of the data

782
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,220
if you want

783
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,619
had begun as a philosophical on method

784
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:50,119
and tried to turn it into into a
scientific one

785
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,979
later on

786
00:34:51,979 --> 00:34:53,659
paul good to consult

787
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:58,089
all the baby all the made conscious
experience the center called for a his

788
00:34:58,089 --> 00:34:59,109
psychology

789
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:02,380
it began with this really interesting
distinction which will come up

790
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,779
all again and again in this class

791
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:06,510
trying to distinguish between so i could

792
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,210
members was a cycle physicist

793
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,160
between physics

794
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,009
and psychology

795
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:16,040
is the science of the world as it exists

796
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,570
independent of an experienced in
individual there's a world out there

797
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,249
that exists whether word here or not

798
00:35:22,249 --> 00:35:26,619
pauline exists whether were aware of it
or not and that's what physics tries to

799
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:27,709
describe

800
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:28,999
but psychology

801
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:30,859
is the science of experience

802
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:36,119
as it's dependent upon me and that they
had to be experiencing individual

803
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,960
there's not there's ascension being

804
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,339
who was aware of what's going on in the
world

805
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:41,950
units those experiences

806
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,509
that vote tried to all understand

807
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,299
over in his psychology and in fact

808
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:48,619
large part

809
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:50,559
opens program of research

810
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:54,779
was to engage in what he called the kind
of mental chemistry

811
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:56,769
complex mental states

812
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:58,539
feeling you have when you

813
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:00,210
fallen loan for

814
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,529
univ dinner or a c_e_o_ a traffic
accident out on oxford avenue or

815
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,140
whatever

816
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,849
and analyze that complex conscious state

817
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:12,869
intuit's elementary sensations images
and feelings

818
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:15,319
on psychology

819
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:19,019
called the psychologist in the late
nineteenth century

820
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,800
completely focused on consciousness

821
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,309
it was very much overhaul of the new
york

822
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:25,429
a scientific

823
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:27,019
unconsciousness

824
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:27,859
all of that

825
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:31,749
went away of course for those viewers
psychology majors and know something

826
00:36:31,749 --> 00:36:33,589
about the history of psychology

827
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:36,900
with what is known as the behaviorist
revolution

828
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,489
in psychology

829
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:42,279
people like john b walks in and later
olympiad scanner

830
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:48,089
argued that james was wrong to define
psychology as a science of mental life

831
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:49,640
because from their point of view

832
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,520
they're going to happen

833
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,150
a science fundamental life you can't
have it the bad thing

834
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,059
on to read a text book about

835
00:36:56,059 --> 00:36:57,640
and they are going to be remembered

836
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,159
bug this way

837
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:01,459
science is objective

838
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:06,599
sciences salt that doesn't run tries to
describe the world independent of

839
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,199
people's kinds of experiences

840
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,230
but the method of introspection

841
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,809
that was used by the cycle fiza system
was used by

842
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:17,449
the awb dubbed by by by people like
blood

843
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:19,169
necessarily subject it

844
00:37:19,169 --> 00:37:23,349
all or would the cold wind gust people
to do was to describe their experiences

845
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:27,079
and and and dot blots and you can't have
an objective science

846
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,579
if all you're doing is asking people to
describe

847
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,799
their experiences

848
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:32,910
science also

849
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,230
depends on public observation the whole

850
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,409
point of science

851
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:41,039
is reputed to be able to confirm each
other's observation i do experiment you

852
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,779
know i drop some all softly go leaning
tower of peas on may fall on a

853
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:45,830
particular way

854
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:50,109
and then if you will repeat that
experiment you can do the same thing

855
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:50,759
consciousness

856
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:55,719
on watson pointed out is unnecessarily
private i have no why do you know

857
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,680
what's going on through your mind right
now

858
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,089
on uh... died and uh...

859
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:02,569
man i've had no way

860
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:06,989
volvo above the of making that kind of
or that they do that kind of pop in

861
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:08,179
public

862
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:09,570
because

863
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,789
consciousness is necessarily subjective
in private

864
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:16,630
and science is necessarily objective and
public

865
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,510
yet have

866
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,659
a science of consciousness

867
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:21,960
on soul what watson and scatter

868
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,519
did was to abandon on any talk of
mentality the any talk of mental life

869
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,210
and to refer exclusively

870
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:33,350
to wipe you could have an objective
public science of

871
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,420
which was

872
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,589
behavior

873
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:39,550
walks in and skinner and others all of
this i was what

874
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,130
let's just set aside this mental stuff

875
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,450
deal with that

876
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,079
hong

877
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,089
and let's draw a build a new science all
inside the fine psychology of the

878
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:49,549
science of behavior

879
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:51,870
on a and set of the said about the
problem

880
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,749
of tracking

881
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:56,410
the functional relations between stimuli
in the environment

882
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,630
things that we can publicly observer

883
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,599
that are above that that can be
objectively described

884
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:03,460
behaviors

885
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,530
behavioral responses to them other
things that can be publicly observed

886
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,489
and objectively uh... described

887
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:14,929
so the behaviorist revolution which we
began about nineteen seventeen

888
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:19,369
all and dot continued well into the
nineteen fifties and sixties and

889
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:20,010
psychology

890
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,420
really dispensed with consciousness in
all discussion of mental white

891
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,789
on you can go back into the
psychological literature

892
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:30,799
called of the nineteen thirties and
forties and fifties

893
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:34,599
and find a very few references to things
like perception

894
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,779
or memory

895
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:41,189
or problem solving and the reason for
that was those are all aspects like bob

896
00:39:41,189 --> 00:39:43,630
mental lights are all aspects of
consciousness

897
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,020
and they were ruled out

898
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,150
of scientific psychology

899
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,839
basically body alone

900
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,719
behaviorist revolution

901
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:55,519
nevertheless there was a persistent
interest in consciousness there is some

902
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,189
people were not

903
00:39:57,189 --> 00:40:00,239
of those swept up in the behavior of
revolution

904
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,779
all and there were people who are built
into the certain for colleges who said

905
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:07,159
look you know there's some really
interesting problems here

906
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:11,569
are dished all psychology for those of
you had a course in perception

907
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:15,599
paula uh... thaw the did the idea that

908
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,619
you can't add a lawyer for perceptual
experience into did so the stimulus

909
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:21,220
elements

910
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,759
because for whole experience is greater
than the folders parts

911
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:26,490
gestalt psychology

912
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,009
essentially

913
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:29,829
kept in interest installed consciousness
alive

914
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:31,320
on one perception

915
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:31,700
people

916
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,419
i was mostly in europe

917
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:37,299
or didn't have much impact on american
psychology and phil

918
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:40,619
on over nineteen thirty's nineteen
forties

919
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:43,699
there were people like all of rest would
work

920
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:46,959
who are interested in problems like the
span of apprehension

921
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:49,459
span out the problem of the span of
apprehension is

922
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:53,759
how many things can you keep in mind at
one time

923
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:57,229
answerers roughly seven plus or minus
two

924
00:40:57,229 --> 00:40:58,710
if you think about it for a second

925
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,370
how many things can you keep in your
mind at one time is a question about

926
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,419
consciousness that would never have
occurred

927
00:41:04,419 --> 00:41:07,789
to what's the risk of her to ask a
question alike that but i think that

928
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:10,159
they did occur to work for it

929
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,019
on uh...

930
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:14,679
harvard psychologist for a vague tool

931
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:18,999
part of or that fought against the
behaviorist revolution of the what he

932
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:20,880
called the score mix psychology

933
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,769
and again which can be summarized by
this very nice phrase

934
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:28,000
which will see echoes of or in this
course

935
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,249
mental life begins with a cognition

936
00:41:31,249 --> 00:41:35,320
continues with a culmination a motive
and ends with an abstraction

937
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,910
an abortion

938
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,279
cognition

939
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:40,459
motivation an emotion

940
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:41,599
thinking

941
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,539
feeling and desire those are the
essential features of conscious mental

942
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:47,259
life

943
00:41:47,259 --> 00:41:49,030
and whereas the behaviors

944
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,889
wanted to rule in out

945
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:54,049
of barbara donna bounds of a scientific
psychology

946
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:55,750
these guys like mcdougal

947
00:41:55,750 --> 00:42:01,989
on tried to put it that kim i'll skip
that

948
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:04,959
it took until the nineteen fifties

949
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,009
really into the nineteen sixties

950
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:11,630
four psychology to get over its
infatuation with behavior is that

951
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:16,159
and it didn't basically all it as a
result of what's come to be called the

952
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,710
cognitive revolution

953
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,379
in vivid in psychology

954
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:24,139
wholesale change in the way psychologist
thought

955
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:25,510
or about though

956
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:29,649
about their uh... about their business
which basically argued

957
00:42:29,649 --> 00:42:34,599
yet can't understand behavior solely in
terms of stimulus and response

958
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:37,679
and the reason for that is

959
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:39,209
mental life

960
00:42:39,209 --> 00:42:39,839
intervenes

961
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,900
between stimulus response it's not that
stimulus that controls behavior it's a

962
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,449
perception of the stimulus the controls
behavior it's not events in the world

963
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:54,309
that control behavior it's expectations
about events in the world for control

964
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:55,369
behavior

965
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:58,350
and what the congress what the cognitive
revolution dead

966
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,150
was to put

967
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,809
cognition

968
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:06,019
and then eventually the rest of mental
life back into psychology arguing that

969
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:09,979
you really couldn't understand

970
00:43:09,979 --> 00:43:10,989
organisms did

971
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:14,809
whether they're human beings were rats
are dogs or cats or whatever

972
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:20,729
without having something to say about
the cognitive structures and processes

973
00:43:20,729 --> 00:43:22,329
intervened

974
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:23,220
between stimulus

975
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,109
uh... response

976
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:28,539
and if you look back in the history of
psychology of notes thus the salient

977
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:32,439
events in the cognitive revolution

978
00:43:32,439 --> 00:43:37,539
those landmarks of the condom revolution
or all all had to do with consciousness

979
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:41,829
the first cognitive psychologists were
interested in attention

980
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:45,679
and how it was the were able to pay
attention to some things and ignore

981
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,259
other things while we're paying
attention to them

982
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,630
think about that per second

983
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,659
that's a question about consciousness

984
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:54,119
by virtue of pain attention to something

985
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,459
you are bringing it into a conscious
awareness

986
00:43:57,459 --> 00:44:00,630
and by deployment your your attention in
one direction

987
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:03,519
but not another you wore

988
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,140
bringing something into awareness

989
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,689
and excluding other things

990
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:08,520
uh... from where so

991
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,910
ons whole research literature on
attention

992
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,799
or brought consciousness back into the
picture

993
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:17,529
similarly it all the work on uh...
so-called short term memory the magical

994
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,930
number seven plus or minus two rate

995
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:24,179
the capacity of short term memory short
term memory isis photos

996
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:28,249
a sense with a staging area for
consciousness if what you're aware of

997
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:31,650
that that what your award ticket will go
in for your head

998
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,559
this second that's what consciousness is
all about

999
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:37,879
and then there was although the
wonderful light of research early in

1000
00:44:37,879 --> 00:44:40,349
kind of psychology about mental imagery

1001
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:43,009
where people were actually trying to
study

1002
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:47,279
the pictures and other images there
we're going through people's minds

1003
00:44:47,279 --> 00:44:49,029
if you think about that again

1004
00:44:49,029 --> 00:44:50,369
what you're trying to do there

1005
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:54,749
is to study objectively something that's
necessarily private

1006
00:44:54,749 --> 00:44:58,630
close my eyes i come up with an image of
my cat with a beer

1007
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,539
what you're going to do all the david
one mika signs of that is what well what

1008
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:03,409
does it mean

1009
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,759
to have an image of your chat with him
here is a real images of a picture do

1010
00:45:06,759 --> 00:45:08,479
you think it's an image

1011
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,639
all you do you just talking
metaphorically or whatever

1012
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:15,869
by answering those questions or were
actually ask asking questions about

1013
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:17,649
consciousness

1014
00:45:17,649 --> 00:45:19,840
the cognitive revolution

1015
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,390
lame duck foundation for the revival
within psychology and other sciences

1016
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,149
psychology and cognitive science

1017
00:45:27,149 --> 00:45:29,329
four in interest in consciousness

1018
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:31,210
but at the same time

1019
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,490
on but beyond the content of revolution

1020
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:36,169
had all the other certain

1021
00:45:36,169 --> 00:45:36,710
affects

1022
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,419
on the study of consciousness

1023
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:41,759
in part because first the alm

1024
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,650
told the public or the revolution was

1025
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,109
was predicated on on the notion that

1026
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:49,859
the computer is a metaphor for the mind

1027
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:50,829
that's fine

1028
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:56,949
but if computers a metaphor for the mind
nobody thinks their computers conscious

1029
00:45:56,949 --> 00:46:01,519
i don't care how big your mac book is
park it's just not conscious that you

1030
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:03,749
don't think it's conscious right

1031
00:46:03,749 --> 00:46:06,369
all relief we don't think it's we think
it's conscious

1032
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:08,889
right because i had that debate sometime

1033
00:46:08,889 --> 00:46:12,589
god relieved we won't

1034
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:15,859
but that computers can process
information

1035
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:19,899
they are not conscious and we think the
mind of like a computer

1036
00:46:19,899 --> 00:46:22,549
well what does that say about
consciousness right maybe i don't really

1037
00:46:22,549 --> 00:46:26,999
need consciousness to have a mind okay
so on the computer metaphor tended to

1038
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:28,140
undercut

1039
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,689
home the are glad that this is this
interest in consciousness on some other

1040
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:32,989
things did too

1041
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:35,549
on chomsky in cycle linguistics

1042
00:46:35,549 --> 00:46:40,439
norm chomsky argued that will bar
language capacity was based on knowledge

1043
00:46:40,439 --> 00:46:44,299
that we had about language that was with
essentially inaccessible to

1044
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:45,129
consciousness

1045
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:47,219
so uh... raised by issues about

1046
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:51,459
whether consciousness was necessary for
various aspects of human performance

1047
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:55,529
and then there were some philosophers
and some girls like all of those some

1048
00:46:55,529 --> 00:46:56,980
neuroscientists who mortgaged

1049
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:00,039
consciousness was basically just a
matter of folks like ology

1050
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:04,399
that that's your grandmother who talks
about consciousness you know

1051
00:47:04,399 --> 00:47:07,290
all and i and other run sophisticated
people

1052
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,350
but if you're really going to be a
scientist

1053
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,339
youths consciousness and

1054
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:12,090
and all that

1055
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:16,569
has to go the way of largest on uh...
and easter

1056
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:17,509
get

1057
00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:19,469
get away from it

1058
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:23,789
kind of though that the condom
revolution kind of cuts both ways

1059
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:28,219
all talk about this a little bit more
although later on trying to progressive

1060
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:29,220
next time

1061
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,599
because the u

1062
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:35,039
what's happened as a result of the condo
cognitive revolution

1063
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:39,729
lots of psychologists and cognitive
scientists or interested in

1064
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:40,659
consciousness

1065
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:42,889
but this interest unconsciousness

1066
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:46,879
leaves them to be uneasy about what
they're doing

1067
00:47:46,879 --> 00:47:50,499
on there is first and foremost is
positive istic reserve that's basically

1068
00:47:50,499 --> 00:47:53,139
all holdover from behavior as well

1069
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:54,839
consciousness is private

1070
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:58,199
consciousness is subjective how could we
have a science about something that's

1071
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:00,739
that's private and subjected

1072
00:48:00,739 --> 00:48:01,300
home

1073
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,820
there are lots of psychologists and
cognitive scientists who think we should

1074
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:08,140
kind of work for the bottom-up let's not
attack consciousness now

1075
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,660
let's figure out how perception works of
memory works something cute work and

1076
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,070
that will put it all together

1077
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,179
and will get consciousness

1078
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:17,759
are there are people who think that may
be consciousness

1079
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:18,999
we have it

1080
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:23,339
obviously we have a anybody here dot
your conscious

1081
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:24,679
everybody knows your conscious

1082
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:27,209
but maybe consciousness isn't essential

1083
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:29,139
for mental function maybe

1084
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:32,180
good old just go on the following in the
dark

1085
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,710
and then there's finally

1086
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:38,130
all what dog who all went flat again for
thr is called the apple for novelist

1087
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:38,769
suspicion

1088
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:40,500
is nagging feeling

1089
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,389
that although were conscious of things

1090
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:46,999
contest those plays no pausable role in
the world

1091
00:48:46,999 --> 00:48:48,589
that it doesn't matter

1092
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:51,000
without but whether we're conscious or
not

1093
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,759
because consciousness has no functional
significance is the kind of the

1094
00:48:54,759 --> 00:48:55,279
background

1095
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:56,489
after the scores

1096
00:48:56,489 --> 00:49:00,569
so what we're going to do got forty
seconds to tell you

1097
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:03,289
first thing we're going to is we're
going to talk about various aspects of

1098
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:04,779
the mind-body problem

1099
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:09,389
those of you have a philosophy course no
part of the mind-body problem

1100
00:49:09,389 --> 00:49:13,479
what's the relationship between body and
mind it turns out that there are four

1101
00:49:13,479 --> 00:49:17,089
different mind-body problems paula and
we'll talk about those in the beginning

1102
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:18,739
of the courts

1103
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:22,179
next problem of consciousness is the
problem of the knowledge of our own

1104
00:49:22,179 --> 00:49:23,099
mines

1105
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:24,159
we are

1106
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,709
to what extent can deal with a or b
aware of what were perceive even

1107
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:31,029
remembering and thinking and feeling

1108
00:49:31,029 --> 00:49:32,950
maybe introspection isn't

1109
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:35,109
valid after all

1110
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:37,160
and then there's a problem of

1111
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,809
knowledge about their minds how do we
know

1112
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:42,319
when somebody else's conscious

1113
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:46,109
on of the problem the comes up when we
try to describe arief altered states of

1114
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:47,949
consciousness like

1115
00:49:47,949 --> 00:49:51,049
anesthesia or drug affects or whatever

1116
00:49:51,049 --> 00:49:55,859
but also when we get back to a good for
the the the problem trying to clear out

1117
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,039
nonhuman animals

1118
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:00,719
or conscious or whether our mac book
really is

1119
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:02,249
squaw after all

1120
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,499
and then finally

1121
00:50:03,499 --> 00:50:06,890
questions about the origins of
consciousness where it is consciousness

1122
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:07,960
come from

1123
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,250
where does that fit in

1124
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:13,160
in both the evolutionary scheme of
things and in the development

1125
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,079
all the palm

1126
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:17,430
of the individual organist

1127
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:18,599
