1
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:06,469
the last couple times we've talked
mostly about the distinction between

2
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:09,459
automatic and controlled processing

3
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:11,120
and the reason i want to do that

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,009
is to introduce you to any

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,660
body of literature on the so-called
unconscious mental life

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,009
which we're going to continue distrust
for the next couple weeks

7
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:27,099
automatic process eased at least in
principle or unconscious processes

8
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:29,239
in the strict sense of the term

9
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,740
because in the first place

10
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,610
we're not aware of these goes on these
processes as they operate

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,790
and second

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,800
their automatic

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,969
we don't have any control over these
processes

14
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,860
as they operate

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,320
and for that reason

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,470
fun car cause automatic process he's has
sometimes been characterized as the new

17
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,010
one conscious

18
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,780
freudian unconscious is the old
unconscious automatic prophecies of the

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,020
new unconscious for which there's some
kind of scientific evidence

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,330
now that's true so far as it goes

21
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,499
but i want to make a distinction between

22
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:06,910
a process dean automatic

23
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,590
and

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,759
on mental state

25
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:11,540
i've done for a process being on
conscious

26
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,079
and a mental state being unconscious

27
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,560
it's one thing

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,750
not to know hollow you would construct
some per sector memory or whatever

29
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,710
it's another thing for you not to know
what that percept or memory is

30
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,200
and that's

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,540
the subject

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,920
the next couple of lectures

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,200
i put this up to specific founded in the
scientific american

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,060
this is the best description of the best
depiction of now i know of the so-called

35
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,820
iceberg a metaphor

36
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,749
for the mind

37
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:43,020
the general idea of being

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,540
there's only a small part of mental life
that is

39
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,039
on the surface

40
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,200
accessible a consciousness

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,340
and a large part

42
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,520
of mental life

43
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,380
that is below the surface

44
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,329
donald side of conscious awareness

45
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,380
now as i pointed out i think last time

46
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,299
iceberg metaphors sometimes attributed

47
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:04,470
freud in fact freud net did not use it

48
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,020
on at least we didn't use it in writing

49
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,659
palm

50
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:10,969
but there is actually a worldwide
scholarly search

51
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:14,919
to discover who would was who actually
introduce the iceberg report for the

52
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,649
unconscious

53
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:19,189
if you can ever find that it documented

54
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:23,219
you might actually get your name in
lights

55
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,039
so what's the fallout

56
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,540
all immanuel kant put a very nicely all
more than two hundred years ago

57
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,379
when he called and talked about this
contradictory aspect on fall all those

58
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,859
of consciousness

59
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:35,919
all because

60
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,009
it seemed to him

61
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:42,139
we had no idea is even though we were
unconscious all of them and he thought

62
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:44,349
there was some kind of contradiction of
that

63
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:47,120
to have ideas that we had not be
conscious of them

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,520
there seems to be some conduct on cutler
contradiction on that

65
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,879
for how can we know that we have them

66
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,979
if we're not conscious of them

67
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:57,839
and the goal for the next

68
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:01,430
all lectures is to show you how in fact
we do know

69
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,890
that we have a unconscious ideas

70
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,510
even though were not

71
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,040
conscious of them

72
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,040
got it right all we know this although
it would weaken our because identify

73
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,819
these unconscious ideas

74
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,659
by looking

75
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,689
at their indirect effects

76
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:18,589
on our experience

77
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:20,269
and action

78
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,519
been able to show we actually have
unconscious ideas even though we're not

79
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:25,499
conscious of them

80
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:30,569
is important because uh... james himself
pointed out one hundred years ago

81
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,059
the distinction between the unconscious
on the conscious been of the mental

82
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:39,579
state is the sovereign means for
believing what one likes in psychology

83
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:42,980
and perjury what might become a science
into a tumbling grown

84
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,959
uh... frequencies

85
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,339
james's beautiful writer

86
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:50,700
but you can see what the problem is

87
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,719
when you think about kind of boulder

88
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,719
freudian ism

89
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:56,969
where a patient comes into our to a
psychoanalyst

90
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:59,840
and says i'm depressed i'm anxious and
this time that

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,140
and if i could live with those wealthy
the problem is you have this one

92
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,570
resolved oedipus complex

93
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,500
you want to have sex with your father in
the hague your mother or u wanna have

94
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,610
sex with your mother you hate your
father or whatever it is to do so

95
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,049
and the patient says

96
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:14,059
no i don't

97
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:15,510
and the third this says

98
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,369
yes you do

99
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:20,239
i know you do because i'm a
psychoanalyst and i know how the

100
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,069
unconscious operates and let me explain
to the concept of repression

101
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:27,050
the sovereign means for believing what
one white

102
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,000
what one likes

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,999
if you can just simply say you don't
know what you know

104
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:32,290
you don't know what you feel

105
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,270
you don't know what you want

106
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,799
what you want is really unconscious and
i'm going to tell you what it is

107
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,220
so what we want to have

108
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,760
is some objective way of determining

109
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,430
whether a person has

110
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,960
one consciously beers

111
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,710
and what those unconscious ideas all are

112
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,900
and on-site though that suggested before

113
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,279
this scientific approach to the nature
of our unconscious mental life

114
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,110
balm

115
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,300
well its approach but it is not fully
satisfied

116
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,780
by the idea that automatic process he's
all run conscious in the strict sense of

117
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,310
deal

118
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,509
of the term let me just skip over this
because i don't need it

119
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:16,550
the general idea here is that mental
processes can be

120
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,079
unconscious

121
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:21,169
if they're performed automatically or
pre attentively because if you think

122
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:23,939
about the earlier of theories of the
unconscious

123
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:27,130
but the implication although voted on
one of the custody

124
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,469
is it at some point

125
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:34,249
the mental state constructed by the
automatic process becomes conscious

126
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:37,639
you may not know exactly how it comes to
be

127
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,370
that you perceive some objects as more
distant

128
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,059
all they did to you that bothers albee
now know that that's

129
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:47,279
that happens by virtue of the automatic
application

130
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,889
of these so-called size distance rule

131
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:54,610
but at least the mental states that are
created by these automatic processes

132
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,559
barroom principle

133
00:05:56,559 --> 00:06:00,589
that is their consciously accessible we
know what we see and what we remember

134
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:01,750
and all of that

135
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,610
even if we can know exactly how we see

136
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,710
all were exactly how we remember

137
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,269
alm

138
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:10,349
so what we want to know is now

139
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:11,360
trend these

140
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,580
mental states

141
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,389
the products of automatic processes

142
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,650
also

143
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,139
homes on the beat on

144
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,189
also be unconscious and that's the
question

145
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,679
all for the next couple of

146
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:23,729
or the lectures

147
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,539
can mental states the unconscious

148
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,650
those things like on talk about

149
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,419
uh... beliefs and knowledge and feelings
and desires and perception memories and

150
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,899
all of that

151
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:36,080
ten-day

152
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,520
influence

153
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,470
are ongoing experience thought and
action

154
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,560
in the absence

155
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,430
of conscious awareness

156
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,969
all these

157
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:44,870
and feelings

158
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,110
and desires

159
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,119
this is a controversy that's been in
psychology since before the time of

160
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,099
right

161
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:55,800
came to a head or when freud started
talking about unconscious mental life

162
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,229
and continues to be double its on today

163
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:01,650
so now just to set the rules here

164
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,869
what do we mean by mental states

165
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:06,909
we're not talking anymore about mental
processes

166
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:08,669
we're talking about

167
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,500
and feelings

168
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,789
desires and that's one of the reasons
why

169
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:15,430
a couple of lectures ago introduced

170
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,910
this term about intention ality

171
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:23,360
and brent autos idea that intention
elevate is the work of the mental james

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,009
talks about it to us a fortress had

173
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,069
and remember that in though

174
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:30,370
then the jargon on philosophers

175
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,569
intentionally doesn't really mean what
you intend to do or what you want to do

176
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:36,479
it means what the mental state is about

177
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,449
and the general idea of what that that
brent connell had

178
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:42,800
is ever or mental states or a boat

179
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,849
something else

180
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:45,129
we proceed

181
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,669
something in the world we remember
something that happened in the past

182
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,500
jane is put at the same way

183
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,510
mental states deal with objects
independent of themselves we don't just

184
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,059
have

185
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,479
we have thoughts about something

186
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,019
we don't just have

187
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:00,479
percept

188
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,289
we have percept about something that our
mental representations of something

189
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:08,810
and professor john searle says that
admit much the same way

190
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,639
that or mental states have content in
that they've referred us on the specific

191
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,759
feature of the world

192
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,970
if i have a memory

193
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,430
it's a memory that something happened

194
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,569
if i have a perception

195
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,509
on something that's off but that isn't
the perception

196
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:25,900
that something exists

197
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,690
all of them

198
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,599
the world

199
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,030
so now will be one analyst

200
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,199
you can have can you have

201
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:33,610
mental states

202
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,269
intent with intention now we that is
they represents something

203
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:39,720
all of the other than themselves

204
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,979
all of them that are themselves
unconscious

205
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:44,770
for all

206
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,870
inaccessible

207
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,720
conscious awareness

208
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,220
and of course the answer's going to be
yes

209
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,080
so let's start by looking at conscious
or unconscious mental states

210
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,760
in the cognitive domain

211
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,439
by which we mean

212
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:58,650
unconscious perceptions

213
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,700
on conscious memories

214
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,290
unconscious knowledge

215
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:02,540
unconscious

216
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,780
uh... thoughts

217
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,319
these are things that

218
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:09,689
when their conscience they clearly have
intention only if i say i know how to

219
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:13,470
try ones are not uh... ended in a
necktie

220
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,730
or i perceive that there's a podium over
there

221
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,400
or if i remember drivin off

222
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,030
to grow of two children park yesterday

223
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,359
those mental states all had intention
ality

224
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,460
and they're conscious mental states

225
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,750
and the challenge i think laid down

226
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,550
fall by uh... body a brent otto and
others is to try to figure out

227
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,040
whether we can have or unconscious
mental states

228
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,230
mental states that are perception
memories and four th

229
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,830
even though we're not consciously aware
of them

230
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,790
the earliest good evidence that this is
the case

231
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,440
comes from studies of the army's x
syndrome

232
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,010
of neurological syndrome sometimes

233
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,520
though incorrectly

234
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,179
that although uh...

235
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,100
labeled of course across syndrome

236
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,170
that occurs when people have bilateral
damage to one or the other

237
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,210
of to uh... of to bring structures

238
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,140
most commonly in the media llc from
medial portion of the temporal lobe

239
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,900
right about there

240
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,529
all affecting

241
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,510
structure that's right here in known as
the hippocampus

242
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,850
all four less commonly

243
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,480
all at the end of the uh... the sort of
co subcortical structures known as the

244
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,970
dyan stuff along

245
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,670
affecting especially the babbling bodies
battery positions here

246
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,770
uh... dear the you know new high
perfomance

247
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,970
and what happens is that

248
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,059
damage

249
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:37,590
bilateral damaged he got to with these
so if you're white gold both of them

250
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,599
all bilateral damage to

251
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:43,300
one or the other all of these
subcortical brain structures

252
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,389
are produces

253
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:47,300
what's known as a specific memory
deficit

254
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,529
which is to say

255
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,800
that the patience

256
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,129
problems with memory

257
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,500
but they don't have problems with
anything else

258
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,940
paid their language functions on
impaired their general intelligence is

259
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,830
on impaired they could perceive the
world they can think they can do all

260
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,090
sorts of things

261
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,730
they jospin remember

262
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,930
and the specific memory deficit what's
love the primary feature of the specific

263
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,300
memory deficit is what's known as a and
carol great amnesia

264
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,750
that covers memory for what our notes

265
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,749
host morbid a battle of the events
that's a medical term

266
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:21,470
that basically means events that occur

267
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,010
after an injury has occurred

268
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,740
so i don't wipe out the person's
hippocampus

269
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,309
fall bilaterally

270
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:30,309
on on both sides of the brain and what
happens is

271
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:34,030
the person can no longer remember

272
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,540
that have happened

273
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,050
more controversial e

274
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,930
the amazing syndrome can the sometimes
involve a retrograde amnesia as well

275
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,669
that is

276
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:45,750
it covers

277
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,950
pre morbid

278
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,290
events on vents that occurred

279
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:49,799
before

280
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,429
the injury occurred that parts
controversial i do want to get into it

281
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:55,020
that's for another course

282
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,399
all but we're going to do all the focus
on here

283
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,610
is he encouraged raid component of the
music syndrome

284
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,189
yet get the brain damage

285
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,710
and you could no longer remember new in

286
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,380
new information

287
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,009
news all things have happened

288
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:11,450
since the brain damage occurred

289
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,839
well beginning in the nineteen fifties

290
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,040
all carved some all of them

291
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,189
norrell psychologists

292
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:19,009
they'd weren't even call that badly

293
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:21,490
didn't have that label all began dust

294
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,750
began to use experimental techniques
drawn from the psychology laboratory

295
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:32,390
to study various patterns solve all of
the various effects or brain damage on

296
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,820
cognitive functioning

297
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,020
and among the earliest of these was
started by warrington whites crimes

298
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,660
elizabeth warrington and larry weiss
grounds

299
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,910
all published in the late nineteen
sixties

300
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,779
on memory in the air music syndrome and
they used up

301
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:48,390
fo familiar bramble learning procedure

302
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,670
to study what n_b_c_ patients couldn't
could not remember

303
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,440
so remember these are patients who have
documented brain damage

304
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,529
can remember

305
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:00,880
things and although that things have
happened to the recently

306
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,070
are and what more into the white scratch
that

307
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,520
bring these people into the laboratory
so that they could study they studied

308
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,330
worked on the world

309
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,490
more rigorously

310
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,120
okay so imagine what you do when one of
these standard verbal learning experince

311
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,450
is that you present the subject with
assault with a list of words the study

312
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,210
of that's why it's called verbal morning

313
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,389
all like these

314
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,980
and then after a while you take the list
away

315
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,750
and u_s_ the person what he or she

316
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,470
karen uh...

317
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,920
can remember

318
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,200
warrington away scratched did this with
a group called that music patients

319
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,639
and a group of controls

320
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,570
and if i mean was

321
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,430
the music patients remembered very
little

322
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,930
of this wordless sure variations third
gradations of amnesia

323
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,279
fault

324
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,410
whereas the control patients

325
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,560
home who didn't have this brain damage

326
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,030
we're able to but remember affair amount
of it this is the basic phenomenon

327
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,620
and her great amnesia

328
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,350
where these

329
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,670
uh... and music patience

330
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,370
perform very poorly on recall tests

331
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,340
of memory

332
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,720
are just a kind of off the ante a little
bit

333
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,360
or into the white scranton

334
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,980
sees all of the uh... subjects through
an area of the recognition test as well

335
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,190
they presented them with a long list of
words

336
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,700
fumble which

337
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,439
words from the study list

338
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:20,110
they're called targets

339
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,510
others were

340
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,809
costs of words

341
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:27,190
that word that did not appear in the
study list

342
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,019
alm and ask them something to say which
ones

343
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:34,820
all day of the recognized from the study
was

344
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,380
and

345
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,939
here you can see the performance

346
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:40,709
of the emusic patients they're they're
basically a chance to the two

347
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:43,070
alternative force choice recognition
fast

348
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,910
whereas

349
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,939
the our control on patients were doing
pretty well

350
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:51,169
on this test again the difference
between a nuisance and controls on this

351
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:52,560
recognition past

352
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,750
distros

353
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,360
onward even even more rigorous

354
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,090
uh... documentation

355
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,970
of their

356
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,720
memory deficit

357
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,840
as a general rule not always true but as
a general rule

358
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,160
performance on recognition persons
better than performance on reporters you

359
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,360
can see that

360
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,199
could see that here

361
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,159
so even if you give a pretty easy tess

362
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,129
they still

363
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,430
org remembering all very much

364
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:21,080
okay so experiments like this leading to
an initial characterization all of the

365
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,069
psychological deficit in the emusic
syndrome

366
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:27,240
as a kind some kind of learning all
failure

367
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,190
lots of memory or a waltz of new all
learning all leading neuro psychologist

368
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,279
to begin to ask a question as well

369
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,389
is there anything that these damn easy
patients come learn

370
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:40,550
thug that are they completely void of
the capacity to work

371
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,240
or is that there's something that

372
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,480
that they can learn

373
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,380
member how we define warning classically

374
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,480
alm and in order to study invest more
into the white scraps concoct are

375
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,160
concocted

376
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,830
on yet a third test which they presented
to the subjects as a guessing game

377
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,019
and discussing game

378
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:59,610
ka comes into basic forms

379
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,820
one is words stem completion

380
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,920
i'm thinking of the word that begins
with these three letters can you fill in

381
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,180
the blanks

382
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,870
and some pictures simply sposed to

383
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,629
the author with it and fill in the
blanks

384
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:12,800
with the first word all that comes to
mind

385
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,660
or edward fragment completion

386
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,370
you don't have a stem anymore you've got
a fragment

387
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,100
i'm thinking of a word that has these
letters and it

388
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,409
kenya filling the blanks

389
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:23,480
and star subjects were supposed to come
up

390
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,680
with the first word

391
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,470
that comes to mind

392
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,870
if you've been looking back

393
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,880
you noticed that these stems

394
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,100
actually are stems from words from the
study was

395
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,480
and these fragments

396
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,519
or fragments that can be completed

397
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,360
with words

398
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,550
from the study list

399
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,540
so the point of this guessing game

400
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,690
is to see

401
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,310
whether subjects will actually

402
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,050
although

403
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,239
uh... the about the complete

404
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:52,500
these these stems or fragments with
items from the study list

405
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,380
and the answer is

406
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,260
normal subjects

407
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,910
they tend to complete these were these
all of those stems and fragments with

408
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,310
items from the study list

409
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,170
they've been primed formal come back to
work

410
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,710
but the interesting thing was

411
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,669
that'd be amazing patients

412
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:11,320
performed in exactly the same way

413
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,130
they showed exactly the same tendency

414
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,650
as the control subjects

415
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,120
to complete the stems and fragments with
words from the study was

416
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,169
apparently

417
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:22,360
studyin the

418
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,010
although the words on the study list
being exposed to the words of the study

419
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,920
list

420
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,210
made those words come to mind were
easily on the stem

421
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,880
hall and uh... and and fragment
completion test

422
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,820
the avenues x

423
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,399
were able to perform

424
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:40,910
joseph as well as the control subjects

425
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,070
just opposed to control subjects that

426
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,080
this is all true dot reintroduce intern
we've talked about before

427
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,100
a phenomenon known as priming

428
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,929
priming his dog out of this is all a
defined

429
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:56,330
as they are job

430
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,580
and case where

431
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,910
the processing of one item

432
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,599
fault redeemed the word

433
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:07,300
ash can on the study list influences
processing of a rather write 'em

434
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,290
that is

435
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,429
completing the words stand a stage

436
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:13,820
with ash can as opposed to ashtray

437
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,080
and if you think about the conventional
definition of wording

438
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,760
has so much a relatively permanent
change in behavior that occurs as a

439
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,480
result of experience

440
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,299
this prime in effect

441
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,790
represents the morning and a very broad
a sense of the term

442
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,350
now just to tops allies in cross some
keys here

443
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,170
prime aim for a primary text take two
forms

444
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,080
positive priming affects

445
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,790
one task

446
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,710
facilitates

447
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,179
performance

448
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:42,870
on a subsequent ask

449
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,059
and there are negative priming effects

450
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,330
where the first test

451
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,100
in paris performance

452
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,800
on the subsequent tests

453
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,910
were not ever going to be talking about
negative priming effects or they're hard

454
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,970
to get

455
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,289
and they're not relevant for all for us
they're interesting

456
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,810
they're just not relevant in this
context

457
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,920
we're going to be talking exclusively

458
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,870
positive palm

459
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,990
posited prime in fact

460
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,100
and the point here is

461
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,630
and music's show the same amount of

462
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,240
priming as control subjects too

463
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,480
even though they can't consciously
remember the price

464
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,440
they don't recall the words list but it
was

465
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,930
they don't recognized

466
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,750
the words from the study was they have

467
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,130
as far as we can tell

468
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,570
no conscious recollection of the words
from the study was

469
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,929
yet they show these priming affects
there clearly influenced by of memory

470
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:34,250
that they're not

471
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,720
consciously aware of

472
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,149
there clearly influenced by something
that's been stored in memory

473
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:40,350
that they clamp

474
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,890
consciously

475
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,690
these kinds of affects which are now
pretty well documented lead band

476
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,860
schachter then a toronto now at harvard

477
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,149
ought to make a distinction between

478
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,700
all add up to expressions of memory

479
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,840
explicit memory and implicit memory

480
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,690
because identify explosive memory with
conscious recollection

481
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:07,600
as reflected for example in people's
performance on tests of recall

482
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
recognition

483
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,930
and we can define implicit memory

484
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,320
any aspect

485
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,590
followed of past experience

486
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,360
on the persons

487
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,290
subsequent

488
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:18,970
experience

489
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,980
thought or action

490
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,910
that's implicit memory because

491
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,680
if there is a fact of the past on
experience for action

492
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,520
there's a memory implied in their
something has to have been stored

493
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,750
paul and uh... filled memory is implicit
in the effect

494
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,940
so any effect on experience for
direction

495
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,380
that's attributable to a pass the bed

496
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,240
and the finding from studies like the
warrington aways cram study

497
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,180
was simply that all priming effects

498
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:52,029
can occur in in the absence of conscious
recollection they could be dissociated

499
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:56,400
from conscious recollection all if you
are or if you will

500
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,690
and only in this case

501
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,780
the fact the primary fax occur in the
absence of conscious recollection

502
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,490
is that these private effects

503
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,400
seemed to represent

504
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,070
memory

505
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,920
there a trace of some past experience
the study experience

506
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,730
but they're and unconscious

507
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,620
there are bad all their memory entrees

508
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,430
that people simply hard

509
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,170
all the people simply aren't aware of

510
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:25,420
that's the basic distinction between
explicit and implicit memory

511
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,340
it's going to store as the

512
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,110
model

513
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,639
jill doggone later discussions

514
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:35,650
of all unconscious mental life

515
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,940
and other domains like perception and
thinking and so and so on

516
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,020
but this

517
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,960
basic distinction

518
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,040
is the one we have to

519
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,780
we have to world

520
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,950
deal but

521
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,210
and all

522
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,289
priming effects of the sort that i just
showed you

523
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,809
exemplify implicit memory

524
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:57,330
that you can get them you don't have to
consciously remember anything

525
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,870
all you even get these primary facts
when you don't consciously remember

526
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,420
uh... anything

527
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:08,290
priming effects exemplified implicit or
unconscious

528
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,900
if you read this literature

529
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,000
you'll see lots of different hats

530
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,660
used to study

531
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,470
and all of the want to point out

532
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,999
i don't think i'll get to

533
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:22,550
i'll finish this dog

534
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,180
this part of

535
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,290
for this lecture today will see

536
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:25,980
all but

537
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,809
in all the cabinet rotate in the case i
just presented to you the warrington

538
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:31,320
aways krantz case

539
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,870
and in the basque majority of studies of
the implicit memory

540
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,080
dog investigators are studying

541
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,910
formal priming cold repetition priming

542
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,890
and it's all the defining feature of
repetition priming

543
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,220
that the item presented at the time of
testing

544
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,960
is

545
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,490
some kind of

546
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,090
re capitulation

547
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,740
all of the item that was presented at
the time of study

548
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,740
solo queria ask you to study the word
ashtray

549
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,610
a sage t_r_ a_w_ a good p_r_ a white

550
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,870
the item presented at the time of study

551
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,450
then i ask you to complete the words
stand a stage with the word

552
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,049
and you produce and trade supposed to
ask him

553
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:16,470
or something like that

554
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,779
item presented the pilot asked the stand
a sage

555
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:21,000
is a partial

556
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,480
recapitulate shin of the item presented

557
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,130
uh... at the time of study so here you
have

558
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,040
human sample of this or in terms of stem
completion

559
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,840
paul or ash can or whatever

560
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,150
a blank page point-blank

561
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,429
and that would also be a partial

562
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:39,630
we capitulation

563
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,450
of the word presented at the time of
study

564
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,070
in a perceptual identification procedure

565
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:49,100
you put the item up but the subject
studied but you make it difficult to

566
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,769
read

567
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:51,500
in one way or another

568
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,490
and you measure the amount of time it
takes a subject to identify the stimulus

569
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,230
and it turns out

570
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,700
by the subjects will identify

571
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,770
stimuli drawn from the study was

572
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:07,340
more rapidly more accurately then and
then they'll identified

573
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,410
stimuli that work

574
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,610
previously

575
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,150
and then finally

576
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,470
another good example of a repetition
priming or the test

577
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,400
is what's known as the lexical decision
task where you put the whole word

578
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,620
up there

579
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,230
and then what the subject has to do is
simply say

580
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,830
whether it's a legal english word

581
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,980
that's the old that's just the task

582
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,490
electrical decisions basketball you have
to do anna turns out that there are

583
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,870
prime interfax electrical decision

584
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,200
such that

585
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,730
all-star subjects will be global more
readily

586
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,559
identify

587
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,260
award from the study list as a legal
english word

588
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,530
then they will

589
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,690
or of the word that wasn't drawn

590
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,640
the study was

591
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,860
so they're all priming affects

592
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,950
presentation one item

593
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,399
on thought during the study phase of the
experiment

594
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:56,420
facilitates

595
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,740
processing of that item

596
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,680
uh... very various kinds of tests

597
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,360
so you can think about all these
examples of repetition priming

598
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,320
as represented a kind of

599
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,460
bias in information processing

600
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,810
your body s to complete the stem with
ash can

601
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:17,620
your bias to complete the fragment with
ash your bios to say ask them to word

602
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,940
all and all of that

603
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,480
is based on some kind of memory trace

604
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,100
so i was formed at the time of the study
session yes

605
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,030
in these kinds of experiments it's
usually a couple of minutes just because

606
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,220
we will want to do these experiments
fast

607
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,380
baat karna we're going with this

608
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,990
burmese let me say two things about that
as nixon would say

609
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,880
called the first thing is that

610
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,040
for a psychologist

611
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,720
anything

612
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,020
is at least thirty seconds ago counts as
long-term memory

613
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,870
that's the way we do it for a second the
distractions long-term memory

614
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:58,010
anything that's less than thirty seconds
of distractions probly short term memory

615
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,020
so it's always a role long-term memory
books

616
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,419
now we usually do these bug bees all
part of experiments

617
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:06,760
pretty much elect in

618
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,169
the prime spendable

619
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:10,580
of all laboratory our

620
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,809
but these kinds of private x have been
documented over days

621
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:16,630
months

622
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,190
and years

623
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,110
despite the fact that the subjects can
remember anything at all about them

624
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,460
also larry squire did the boast of halt
thumb

625
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,650
vote one car

626
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,140
longest term study

627
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,940
on he got significant priming and one of
his own music patients after a period of

628
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,630
two years

629
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,940
also anyway that's the basic goal

630
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,200
that's the basic goal of the phenomenon
here

631
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,900
and let me just say one more thing alba
about this that's kind of subtle

632
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,740
and all of this is a little bit
difficult to mess

633
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,010
in all of these studies

634
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,940
performance on the implicit test

635
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,910
priming performance

636
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,910
gore did

637
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:02,350
whereas performance on the test dog
recall or recognition

638
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,760
is with his vote is pretty bad

639
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,969
but if you think about it for a second

640
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:09,490
there's a kind of wierd kind file

641
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:14,310
if you're going to compare performance
on a priming test to performance on say

642
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,100
all free recall test

643
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,840
and that is

644
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,720
the price test provides the subjects
with a different kind of information

645
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,580
at the test

646
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,919
than the free recall test dot if i say
that if i give you a list of words to

647
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,720
study and i said what do you remember

648
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,900
not giving too much of the head about

649
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,620
what you're supposed to be remembering

650
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,560
if i didn't want to words the study and
i say is that she cannot word

651
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,620
well that's a lot of q information

652
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,340
and we know that memory is passed with
or what with all of it

653
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,330
memory improved

654
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,700
to the extent that we supply subject
with lots and lots of

655
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,170
q information at the time of retrieval

656
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,700
so you might argue

657
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,370
that what appears to be spirit priming

658
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,530
on off and on one of these past

659
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,740
is it really

660
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,720
something about

661
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,779
implicit a run conscious memory at all

662
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:06,120
but really has more to do with

663
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,100
well you just gave a more hands so they
perform better

664
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,220
for that reason

665
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:16,220
though a really good tests dissociation
between say implicit explicit memory

666
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,159
keep the q information the same as that
both

667
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,370
the explicit test and the implicit test

668
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,659
so for example

669
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,200
first m cued recall

670
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,669
it's a can you remember a word on the
list

671
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:30,770
that began with

672
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,860
the letters g_ all right

673
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,750
and for the stem completion press the
priming you'd say give me the first word

674
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,740
you can think of that begins with the
letters g_ r_ a_

675
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,960
you hold the cues constant

676
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,049
but you very what the subject has to do
with the q

677
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:50,200
whether they have to remember

678
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,520
consciously remember

679
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,520
something for the past or whether they
don't have to consciously remember of

680
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,660
something for the past

681
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,360
and when you do that

682
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,769
the same dissociation this is work by
peter graft maurice choir in george

683
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:07,680
mandarin u_c_ san diego

684
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,870
comparing stemmed cued recall

685
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,510
stem completion test

686
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,700
these around musics and controls and
what you can see is that the emmys

687
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,649
x_-two worse than the controls

688
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:20,950
stem cued recall

689
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,280
their rap music they can remember to
begin with

690
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,219
but in fact they do a little bit better

691
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:27,799
than the control subjects

692
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,810
on the pet on a test of stem completion

693
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,460
so here you have a nice demonstration

694
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,560
of the dissociation between explicit an
implicit memory

695
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,850
very tightly controlled experiment

696
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:44,400
or where the information presented to
the subjects at the time of test is held

697
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,130
constant

698
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,809
but what they have to do

699
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:51,780
what with that information or varies
between the explicit an implicit test

700
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,320
let me show you a couple more

701
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,820
all examples of this dissociation just
so you can see that

702
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,810
on its not confined to well

703
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,930
single kind of a brain damage

704
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,100
they're a bunch of studies in the
literature

705
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,950
all called balms called

706
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,430
priming the and cases of amnesia

707
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,010

compulsive terribly

709
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:17,450
yeah uncommon

710
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,850
for depression

711
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,800
and what happens in ec ten e

712
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,120
is that palm paid all of the whole day

713
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,969
gold electrical current is delivered
across the company for sometimes

714
00:30:27,969 --> 00:30:29,540
from the defects to the head

715
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,590
onto just one cumple

716
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,230
and that dog that induces like

717
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,260
time don't

718
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:42,130
soto epileptic uh... seizure that
results and a loss of consciousness

719
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,130
and one of the patient called the hog
recovered be begins to recover

720
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:47,890
consciousness

721
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:53,800
although their own that show amnesia for
events that occurred around the time

722
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,480
that the electric convulsive shock was
delivered

723
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,359
they will

724
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:59,580
show and and terror grade amnesia

725
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,600
for events that occur

726
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,090
for a period of time

727
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,630
after

728
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,070
dec ke was delivered

729
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,590
and they'll also show

730
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,660
they retrograde amnesia

731
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,389
for events that occurred

732
00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:13,740
in the period of time leading up to the
delivery

733
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,270
of the c_t_

734
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,030
on you get less of this with the
unilateral ec t where there is one

735
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,650
electrode on the temple of one electrode
the top of the head

736
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,070
you get more

737
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,730
of this and asia at the

738
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,630
you see people it would bilaterally

739
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,569
to be studies of bilateral

740
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:29,900
paul dot you see

741
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,530
but just to make a graphic

742
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,200
the point where

743
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,810

744
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,900
easy to use delivered

745
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,429
immediately after the patient is in
what's known as the post bechtel

746
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:45,980
confusion allstate that is posed seizure

hall above what's going on

749
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:54,600
on their and then they begin to recover
all consciousness

750
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,679
but the entire agreat unusual

751
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:58,380
covers this period

752
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:58,940
after

753
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,570
the shock is the delivered

754
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:04,130
and after the subjects come out of this
post iqbal confusion allstate

755
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,429
the retrograde amnesia covers a period
of time

756
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:12,360
well uh... immediately prior to the
delivery of org

761
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,539
did all of a study of bought explicit
and implicit memory

762
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:30,309
vcd induced and terror grade amnesia

763
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:31,470

but they are jolt of

ec t

768
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,319
and then

769
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:39,370
after they have recovered consciousness

770
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:44,950
all all squire is colleagues asked them
to study word list

771
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,929
and then after they were fully recovered

772
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:52,240
they donna did dog of the press of
memory and what you can see here is

773
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,740
the art of the patients who actually got
the e_c_ t

774
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,520
were densely and these are

775
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,550
for the items that they studied right
after they got the e_c_ p

776
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,440
compared to controls

777
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,669

recognition test

780
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,029
and they're doing pretty badly

781
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,090
on here

782
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:10,750
all but

783
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,700
the subjects are showing the n_b_a_ sick
patients are showing

784
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,689

at exactly the same rate

789
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,559
as the controls so here we have

790
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:24,639
explicit memory

791
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,640
severely impaired

792
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,170
implicit memory

793
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,460
completely spared

794
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,730
not imperative all another example all
of the home

795
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:38,450
uh... of the dissociation between
explicit an implicit memory

796
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,430
all here is a study by jennifer dorfman
and her friends

797
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,800
on all of them explicit in implicit
memory in the

798
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,460
club post bcp retrograde amnesia

799
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,590
what dorfman did was to have subjects
study a list of words

800
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,970
before

801
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,170
obesity

802
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,150
then she let the recover for a while

803
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,440
trust their memory

804
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,799
here is stem q performance on stem she
would recall

805
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,809
very bad performance on the part of the
and music patients

806
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:07,690
very densely and music

807
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,489
performance on stem cued completion at
least the equivalent

808
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,250
albee

809
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,599
non n_b_c_ patients and again

810
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,889
to some extent

811
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,699
if anything the mt sick patients

812
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,189
or performing

813
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:20,799
or performing better

814
00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:22,519
so here's another example

815
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,849
called form

816
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:24,389
on board

817
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:26,029
the dissociation

818
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:27,289
the split

819
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:29,490
between explicit an implicit memory

820
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:33,179
we have explicit memory grossly impaired

821
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,179
and

822
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,030
implicit memory

823
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:41,309
priming effects essentially on impaired
essentially spared

824
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:43,389
here's another example rebel pork

825
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:48,120
yeah anesthesiologist that i worked with
uh... ffa sometime ago

826
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,020
here we were looking at medical patients
undergoing an office procedure

827
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,499
wonder what's known as conscious
sedation

828
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:56,850
some of you have had this maybe for all
the

829
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,900
knee surgery or something like that

830
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,860
where it you'd they don't get a general
anesthesia

831
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,419
what you're dead as a drug

832
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:06,630
this case we used to

833
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,849
of the drug called proper fault

834
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:12,739
which is the drug that killed michael
jackson

835
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:13,460
called but

836
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:18,799
then again you don't take it in doses
like michael jackson talk at

837
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:22,980
on you take it in carefully controlled
doses and under carefully controlled

838
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,899
of circumstances

839
00:35:24,899 --> 00:35:27,500
hauled and uh... impact in these studies

840
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,790
all the patients were able to control
the delivery of the anesthesia called to

841
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,660
themselves they were given a little
button

842
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,880
and whenever they started feeling a
little bit of pain

843
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,540
they could give themselves

844
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,329
for all of the bullets

845
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:41,849
oval purple for make the pain go away

846
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:45,049
all but one of the consequences of this
is

847
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:47,970
you are rendered and music for

848
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,690
but time when you were

849
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,439
sedated by propyl probable

850
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:54,859
now what's interesting about this is you
are completely conscious during the

851
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:56,140
procedure

852
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,479
you're aware everything that's going on
you could talk to the medical team you

853
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:04,009
can watch tv you could read a book you
can job could you could do all sorts of

854
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:04,700
things

855
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,499
but you don't remember any of it
afterwards

856
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,910
okay just have been you'd just like of
anybody here is had this procedure notes

857
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,869
of that

858
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:15,109
on was about the case

859
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:18,010
so while they're conscious that or
anything better to do

860
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,390
so while these people were having
learned their procedure we gave them all

861
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,079
learning task

862
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,179
calm

863
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:26,920
chalte chalte the bug all paris o'shea
learning task

864
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,830
in which they simply studied pairs of
words like hello shouldn't water water

865
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,340
naive

866
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,069
and uh... and so on

867
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:37,170
and then after the uh... although the
anesthesia was terminated

868
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,510
the the conscious sedation was all

869
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,069
was terminated

870
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:42,779
palm

871
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:44,700
we what the recovery little bit

872
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,890
and that we don't prevent did some
memory test of the recovery room so here

873
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,609
we've got

874
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,420
fallen

875
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,880
and the other seizure

876
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,940
and it's a mentor great amnesia that
these

877
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,309
uh... the patients experience you don't
get you don't lose memory for anything

878
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:01,219
that happened in the past

879
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,959
on role but you do have

880
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:05,940
oh video and enter a great amnesia

881
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,369
for the events that occurred

882
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:12,749
while you're a sedated by proper fall

883
00:37:12,749 --> 00:37:13,789
palm

884
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:17,049
this is for or did you have just be a
music patients

885
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:19,719
on stem cued recall we asked him to
distinguish

886
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,449
with after the complete

887
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:23,340
stems from the study list

888
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,739
and from the from a control list they
did very badly

889
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:29,119
we ask you a recognize

890
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,559
words from the study a list

891
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:31,670
verses the controllers

892
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,259
they did very badly

893
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:34,150
point here

894
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:39,930
under free association test it turns out
that the alone theo sedated patients

895
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:42,559
perform just as well as the on sedated

896
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,160
of uh... controls

897
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,569
at producing the items from the of

898
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:47,859
this buddy list

899
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:48,849
song himself

900
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,399
as free associations

901
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:52,329
so again

902
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:53,719
very bad

903
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:56,319
explicit memory here

904
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:00,609
apartment that at the same time as we
see spear priming

905
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:02,650
so just to kind of some up here

906
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,179
you can see these

907
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:11,379
of the descent pattern of resulted in a
walk-in variety all twelve phenomenal of

908
00:38:11,379 --> 00:38:12,079
amnesia

909
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,739
i've shown you uh...

910
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:17,200
coupled examples from the n_b_a_'s x and
wrong

911
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,560
resulting from bilateral damage to the
at the campus and other structures in

912
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,249
the medial temporal lobe

913
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:26,309
show you two examples of patients who
are at music by virtue of electrical

914
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:28,589
book convulsive therapy

915
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:29,289
palm

916
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:33,869
uh... one example of both of this case
were uh... different music

917
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:35,870
by virtue of conscious sedation

918
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,519
and there are other examples

919
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,359
so for example that you can beer you can
do the same kind of experiment with

920
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,499
patients who are under general
anesthesia we did this to

921
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:48,680
uh... we went into the loaded into an
operating theater with patients who were

922
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,779
completely out

923
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:51,460
all because they were having major

924
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,229
of the major surgery

925
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:54,670
and all over earphones

926
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,049
read the more wordless

927
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:57,440
and then we're able to show

928
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,690
that they had priming

929
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,710
all four of those words later

930
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,160
even though they didn't remember
anything about it of show you that study

931
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,979
later

932
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:07,469
all you do the same thing with hypnosis

933
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:11,799
all hypnotized subjects can get a
suggestion for post about again major

934
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:15,260
when you come out of no since you will
remember the things you've done

935
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,489
also while you were at the time

936
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:21,259
on does not but all the time but highly
hypnotize will subjects will come out of

937
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,059
hypnosis

938
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,959
and they'll be on able to remember the
things they did while they worked with

939
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:27,489
the prize at these for a while

940
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:30,309
also in a bunch of experiments people
have

941
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:32,859
of given hypnotized subjects all

942
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:34,259
wordless to study

943
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:36,729
given given them in our nation
suggestion

944
00:39:36,729 --> 00:39:39,059
bring about of hypnosis

945
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:41,360
recall that all recognize the words

946
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,590
but they do show

947
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,259
all they do show priming effects

948
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:47,650
all there even a couple of cases

949
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:52,089
although the public sperm inside genuine
cases of multiple personality disorder

950
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:56,279
so-called isos have identity disorder
like the three faces aviv if you've ever

951
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:59,829
seen that movie which was based on a
real case

952
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:02,339
one personality studies a list

953
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:05,229
and then you test the other
personalities memory for that list that

954
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:06,500
they don't remember

955
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,090
all that saddam would look

956
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,709
features of multiple personally disorder

957
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:15,050
the black and white didn't know what he
black was doing and uh... and so on

958
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:18,229
yet eve white will show prime interfax

959
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:20,620
uh... all for poem

960
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,579
material that was studied by euphoric

961
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:26,869
and that's again or in genuine cases
which there aren't that many of but you

962
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:29,249
can get it and lots and lots of
different

963
00:40:29,249 --> 00:40:31,489
uh... kinds of cases

964
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:35,630
you can even get these kinds of
dissociation in

965
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:39,760
normal neurologically intact not
mentally ill

966
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,819
not hypnotized not sedated not
anesthetized of patients as well

967
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:45,930
all

968
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:50,470
here as well advice example using a
paradigm known as savings in relearning

969
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,859
uh... body all

970
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:55,680
like tom nelson university of washington

971
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,839
what nelson did was to have subjects
study modern honest paired associates

972
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,640
two words paired together

973
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,319
this case of two-digit number

974
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:06,059
and a familiar word like forty eight
book

975
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:08,079
and all thirty-six party

976
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,949
then to get to your question

977
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:10,630
after off

978
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,299
four-week retention interval

979
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:15,219
one month later he brought the subjects
back

980
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:17,220
for a series of memory tests

981
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,839
one of these was like you and recall
test

982
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,760
weary gave them these are big the q
forty-eight and ask them to recall the

983
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,769
associated word

984
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:31,420
another was a recognition test we redid
the majority's between forty eight book

985
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,559
and forty-eight party

986
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:37,239
and awsome to recognize which one they
have actually seen

987
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:42,769
all some subjects performed really badly
on both these tests old cued recall and

988
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,170
recognition they've really

989
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,910
did remember anything

990
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,130
and then what below what job nelson did

991
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,969
was to ask them to

992
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:52,479
perform mix permit all over again

993
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:57,130
to relearn on new although they did to
relearn north on the list of these

994
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,529
kurdistan tips

995
00:41:58,529 --> 00:41:59,739
somewhat which

996
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:01,429
contain the original pairing

997
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:03,230
that they had seen four weeks

998
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,089
earlier

999
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,539
forty-eight book

1000
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:11,250
father parrot associates involved the
repair evolved old stimuli and responses

1001
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,440
like forty eight party

1002
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,099
and what

1003
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:19,289
dharwad nelson dog discovered

1004
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:22,749
subjects showed savings in a real
warning

1005
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,800
for a benz that that will prepare it
were in paris

1006
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,989
that that they could neither consciously
a recall

1007
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:31,749
nor consciously recognize

1008
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,679
here we have calm

1009
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,709
this is for all recalled items

1010
00:42:36,709 --> 00:42:40,819
former cold items that were recognized
their savings have been in mel

1011
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:41,269
relearning

1012
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:43,420
that make sense

1013
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,570
but here our own recalled items

1014
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,680
there were also unrecognized and you
still get savings

1015
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,160
in relearning

1016
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,809
savings and relearning is based on the
presence of these

1017
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:58,839
memory trace of the old event i mean
that's what savings everybody knows it's

1018
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:00,409
a measure of memory

1019
00:43:00,409 --> 00:43:02,819
the fact that subject can show savings

1020
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:04,679
in relearning items

1021
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:10,259
that they neither recall nor recognize
isn't association between explicit an

1022
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:11,690
implicit memory

1023
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,549
memory is there

1024
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,489
affecting people's performance on the
rewarding task

1025
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:19,210
i think it's a it's doing that

1026
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,110
in the absence called ball

1027
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:25,639
in the absence of conscious recollection

1028
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:30,459
here's another example this is from lori
jacoby kaya problem talked about before

1029
00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:31,610
or here

1030
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,330
subjects were given a list of words to
deal with they weren't even have to

1031
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:37,780
remember the blue of the words all there
were asked to do was to make some

1032
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,930
judgments

1033
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,150
about the words

1034
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,359
on one case

1035
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,759
the judgment was a shallow

1036
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:47,509
so-called shallow judgment about the
physical features of the word

1037
00:43:47,509 --> 00:43:49,150
the second paintball

1038
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,460
uh... does it dot contained a letter he

1039
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,929
that's all the subjects were asked to do

1040
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:56,180
enough other caught all in other cases

1041
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,700
the subjects were asked to make a

1042
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,070
on judgment about the semantic
properties of the word

1043
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:06,119
does this word mean the same as this
word is that a synonym or whatever

1044
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:11,499
and then called jacoby in dallas of put
subjects through test of recognition

1045
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:13,499
upon pesto

1046
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:15,019
on explicit memory

1047
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:18,349
and a perceptual identification test
this if we put those up though those

1048
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:22,349
words up and that subjects all of them
behind a mask

1049
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:24,559
and subject simply to identify

1050
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:26,179
what the words work

1051
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:28,779
and the finding of the experiment

1052
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:30,549
this is a familiar

1053
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:31,470
all result

1054
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,079
hidden in the end of the memory
literature

1055
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:35,469
recognition

1056
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:38,799
is better for items that were processed
deeply

1057
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:42,379
as opposed to items that were subject to
shallow processing

1058
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,619
so if you make a judgment about the meat
of an item

1059
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:47,690
you're going to remember it better than
if you just make a judgment about the

1060
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:50,259
physical appearance all of the item

1061
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:51,349
but here

1062
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:54,759
what you see there's a promise of
significant russian effect here

1063
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:56,219
but priming

1064
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:59,859
is unaffected by level of processing

1065
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:03,169
explicit memory has affected by level of
processing

1066
00:45:03,169 --> 00:45:04,909
implicit memory is not affected

1067
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:06,490
by level of processing

1068
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:09,809
you're getting

1069
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:11,400
implicit memory

1070
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,839
independently called ball

1071
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:17,249
of explosives

1072
00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:18,799
forget their help

1073
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,369
so now we have two different kinds of
evidence

1074
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:27,839
for this dissociation between explicit
an implicit memory

1075
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,889
but the the cases i showed you jody
before

1076
00:45:30,889 --> 00:45:34,859
we have what's known as a population
dissociation

1077
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:38,630
where there is some population like
emusic patients

1078
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,709
don't have explicit memory

1079
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:43,739
but do have implicit memory

1080
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:48,839
and then all in the case of the college
sophomores studied by nelson or door

1081
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:55,839
door jacoby or whatever we have the what
are known as functional dissociation

1082
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,039
experimental variable

1083
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,929
like a level of processing or

1084
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:01,080
forgot about something else

1085
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:06,099
will affect performance on an explicit
memory task but won't affect the

1086
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:11,759
on implicit memory test

1087
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:14,179
experi no abhi implicit memory

1088
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:18,309
in the face of impaired explicit memory
isn't confined to just a particular kind

1089
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:19,479
of subject

1090
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:24,939
isn't confined to simply to order simply
to a particular experimental

1091
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:27,059
experimental paradigms

1092
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:28,549
i'm going to see

1093
00:46:28,549 --> 00:46:30,639
this is what i want to show you

1094
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:32,410
these dissociation

1095
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:35,300
between explicit an implicit memory

1096
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,749
call me in free

1097
00:46:38,749 --> 00:46:40,699
what you see mostly

1098
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:45,430
in this literature our water known as
singled associations

1099
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:50,069
where you've got some variable like
whether the patient is and music or not

1100
00:46:50,069 --> 00:46:54,430
or whether the item couple got deep
processing or not

1101
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:58,650
that affects performance on an explosive
memory test

1102
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,230
but doesn't affect

1103
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,239
performance

1104
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:03,440
the implicit memory test

1105
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,890
this is the most common pattern of
results

1106
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,829
in this literature and it's the one

1107
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,429
most important for us

1108
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:12,369
because what you're getting is

1109
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:15,439
no conscious memory

1110
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:16,459
but priming

1111
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:17,639
or some other

1112
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:21,859
paula evidence volvo of one conscious
mem

1113
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:25,060
you will from time to time if you read
deeply enough

1114
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:28,279
were broadly enough in the
neuropsychological literature

1115
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:32,719
c claims for what's known as a double
dissociation

1116
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:33,980
and in this context

1117
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:37,319
a double dissociation whitaker if us

1118
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:40,869
particular variable like whether you
read music were not

1119
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:44,559
whether you processed the items deeply

1120
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,659
would have opposite a fax

1121
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:48,329
on

1122
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:52,509
explicit and implicit memory so here you
have an example where you've got solved

1123
00:47:52,509 --> 00:47:56,140
independent variable doesn't matter what
it is

1124
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,349
improve explicit memory

1125
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:02,939
impair implicit memory

1126
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:07,349
the double dissociation is in some
respects the gold standard of

1127
00:48:07,349 --> 00:48:09,699
neuropsychological work because

1128
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:13,419
that tells you that explode that would
evidence like this would tell you that

1129
00:48:13,419 --> 00:48:18,329
for example that explicit in implicit
memory or mediated by very different

1130
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:22,269
mental modules are very different bring
systems

1131
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:26,019
it's the gold standard it's actually not
just the gold standard it is the holy

1132
00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:27,459
grail

1133
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:32,289
uh... gov neuropsychological research
and precisely because it's the holy

1134
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:34,799
grail these are very

1135
00:48:34,799 --> 00:48:37,159
rarely

1136
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:38,519
instead

1137
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:43,199
most investigators claim to have
discovered a double dissociation what

1138
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:47,599
they've really discovered is what i
prefer to call a twin dissociation

1139
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,559
where you've got true independent
variables eight and b

1140
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,519
one of these independent variables

1141
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:58,609
performance on explicit memory task

1142
00:48:58,609 --> 00:49:01,700
doesn't affect performance audit
implicit memory test

1143
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,309
and a second independent variable

1144
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:08,399
will affect performance on his implicit
memory test

1145
00:49:08,399 --> 00:49:13,829
of performance on an explicit memory
test as i say here beats beefed wind

1146
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:18,409
associations are sometimes claimed is a
double dissociation

1147
00:49:18,409 --> 00:49:23,029
on double dissociation really has to do
with the affects the opposite effects of

1148
00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:25,019
a single

1149
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:27,589
experimental variable on too

1150
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:32,589
thong two different tasks

1151
00:49:32,589 --> 00:49:35,979
now i don't want to do this now all due
this wednesday that sings this is pretty

1152
00:49:35,979 --> 00:49:38,969
much more i wanted to get us to today

1153
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:42,089
explicit memory is conscious
recollection

1154
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:47,519
when people recall or recognize or
previously studied word they consciously

1155
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,799
remember us dave retrieve that item from
memory of brought it in the conscious

1156
00:49:51,799 --> 00:49:53,429
awareness

1157
00:49:53,429 --> 00:49:57,329
priming effects and all other implicit
memory affects heart

1158
00:49:57,329 --> 00:49:58,700
fun conscious

1159
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:04,130
effects of unconscious memory they kind
of current even when the person has no

1160
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:05,440
conscious recollection

1161
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,849
all the priming event

1162
00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:12,739
these dissociation speaking explicit an
implicit memory argun announced serve as

1163
00:50:12,739 --> 00:50:13,830
the model

1164
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:15,149
for looking at

1165
00:50:15,149 --> 00:50:19,799
onto so see issues between conscious and
on conscious mental states in other

1166
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:23,179
domains like perception

1167
00:50:23,179 --> 00:50:27,089
demotion motivation and so on

1168
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:28,549
thanks very much for c_ one wednesday
