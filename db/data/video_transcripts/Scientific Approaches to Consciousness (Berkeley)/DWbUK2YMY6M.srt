1
00:00:01,739 --> 00:00:08,140
okay i'm assuming that clock is still
off by a minute

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,040
so what do i think you've all gotten
should what you what should have gotten

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,289
an email from you now about the all
midterm exam feedback

4
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:19,539
we identified a couple of items that
could have been better and restored them

5
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:21,859
and when we re scored them

6
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,239
they got my scores

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,879
all we also added two points everybody's
scored to compensate a little bit

8
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:28,539
further d

9
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,199
for the length of the exam

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,810
now that i can do about that

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:33,680
and

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,150
that's the distribution of course pretty
good distributions toward

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,230
median score forty four

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,710
use kore

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,240
forty-three

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,270
quite happy

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,230
so

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,810
if you have any questions we're going to
do arguably exams back in your

19
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,990
discussion section

20
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,750
so if you see something that seems
problematic

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,260
consulted yes i am willing going to be
give your restore

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,850
or remember to follow the rules first

23
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,019
donor threes go run

24
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:05,500
the chance that you might get an extra
pointer to

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,799
it's not worth it and you won't

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,500
palm and the reason you won't lose

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,650
just on chance

28
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,220
is at the g_s_ liza been instructed to
be very conservative every scoring

29
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,040
all but if you really think that's a
problem with how one of your questions

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,280
was evaluated

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,100
when a couple of senses

32
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,580
and present that to your g aside and
will take care of that as soon as

33
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,800
possible

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,570
assault let's talk about anesthesia and
komo

35
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,110
and today will talk about anesthesia on
wednesday we'll talk about karma

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,060
and the first thing to do is a little
bit of history here make the point that

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,960
anesthesia is a relatively recent
development in medical practice

38
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,319
introduced only in the mid middle of the

39
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,050
on making century

40
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,419
before that there wasn't anything like
anesthesia

41
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:57,489
people were simply ask to tolerate
surgical procedures whether was the

42
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:02,230
application of a leg gore part of the
word chest surgery or whatever

43
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,870
all sometimes they were given substances
to help them through that

44
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,979
alba alcohol

45
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:11,019
fall sometimes called the sometimes
opiates what warn them

46
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:15,209
all but mostly they were just acid
tolerated given a bite boarding clenched

47
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:16,169
thirty-five

48
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,150
and then restrained so they didn't
called start

49
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,679
fighting the surgeon

50
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:23,430
and the surgeon just went ahead and did
is uh...

51
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,679
and did his thing

52
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:29,509
towards the end of the eighteenth
century however people began getting

53
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:33,819
interested and the use of chemical
agents to relieve pain

54
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,699
and induce anesthesia

55
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:37,890
great british cameras humphry davy

56
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,040
all wasn't early experimenter with this
almost with a with nitrous oxide

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,939
argue from that dialog nitrous oxide
golden's headaches

58
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:50,799
why and also believe dental pain when he
had a uh...

59
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:51,809
infected through

60
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:55,579
but mostly humphrey davies onto humphry
davy found out the people really like to

61
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,679
take a nitrous oxide

62
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:00,980
all that it was not through him that the
home

63
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,149
georgian england

64
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:06,029
all develop this new social event komal
laughing gas party

65
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:10,319
where they'd ask humphry davy to concoct
some nitrous oxide for them and then all

66
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,339
these people would sit around and

67
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:14,099
home

68
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,109
michael faraday heartbreaking wish all

69
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:21,530
that physicist all began experimenting
with another substance of this error

70
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,939
discovered that it had analogies
occasioned

71
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,139
vodpod ideas friends were more
interested in theater parties

72
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,409
palm so let's is kind of never went
anywhere

73
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:34,189
all the even though out

74
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:35,520
brewed beer in the uh...

75
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,519
than the late

76
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,450
eighteenth early nineteenth centuries

77
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,659
people would be game to think that the
home

78
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,349
you could actually get rid of pain

79
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,919
all of this way

80
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,040
all of the problem

81
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,889
for the almost for most of the all

82
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,909
first part of the nineteenth century

83
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:56,089
the only all thing you could do besides
ask the patient to tolerate analgesia

84
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:58,339
was to hypnotize them

85
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,409
all and there were a couple of all
important scholarly monographs on the

86
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,040
use of hypnosis or as it was called them
asthma rhythm

87
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,629
are two while relieve pain and surgical
patients all talk about that a little

88
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,849
bit later in the semester when we talk
about the posters

89
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,639
all but all

90
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,359
florida gradually ether began to be
introduced first in dental practice

91
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,609
and then into medical practice home

92
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:24,309
uh... as they uh... as an anesthetic
agent

93
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:28,340
all and also people rediscovered the end
of static all of them qualities of

94
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,599
nitrous oxide

95
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:31,719
or was it raymond wells

96
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:33,280
volume eighteen forty four

97
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,780
all reported that nitrous oxide was
uh...

98
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,789
job was real good for or

99
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:43,449
does an anesthetic agent for dope for
dental extractions

100
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,359
all unfortunately dull after he was made
that initial report he was asked to

101
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,179
demonstrate the uh...

102
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:52,159
uh... thos technique publicly

103
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,889
and if the patient

104
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:58,310
all who was not under nitrous oxide but
still conscious

105
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,819
palm because that's what you are when
you're under nitrous oxide

106
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:02,380
fallen

107
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,860
of flinched

108
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,610
wind all buddha's tooth has been
extracted and all of the observer said

109
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,590
well he's not it's not a peep audits of
failure

110
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,699
he's not experiencing pain at all

111
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:15,840
and he is experiencing pain after all

112
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,190
and then finally in eighteen forty five
eighteen forty six

113
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,280
all you get the introduction of easter
him into surgery not dental

114
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,569
all of practice but actual medical
surgery

115
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:30,769
on first got to do this was actually a
southern all the of the position in

116
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:32,650
crawford long

117
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,259
after whom the emory university teaching
hospitals named in georgia could ever

118
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,559
been there

119
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:43,319
called base hospital unfortunately alm
while he never published his

120
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,349
observations and so credit for the
introduction of either as an anesthetic

121
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:54,419
agent in surgery goes to arm of the
world well you know another

122
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:55,680
actually a dentist

123
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,849
who introduced this

124
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:58,469
for medical surgery

125
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:59,989
hall at harvard

126
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:04,049
and this is a very famous painting if
you go to the hotel where library at

127
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:06,819
harvard medical school you see this
hanging on the wall

128
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,830
all of this is all of the introduction
of of of the surgery

129
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,390
here is the patient gilbert babbitt
who's having a big sis removed

130
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,930
uh... from his neck

131
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,580
and there's the surgeon uh... warren and
here is orbital

132
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,349
william morton

133
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:28,939
with his little speaker of either on
keeping on keeping gilbert ballot

134
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,349
added unconscious

135
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,450
during this whole procedure this of
course

136
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,830
as good as probably knows how surgery
was done though in those days

137
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,589
they call them operating theaters for a
reason the shift theater

138
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:43,599
ald where the uh... though that the
medical students were all crawled around

139
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,919
all to uh... to watch the procedure

140
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,399
and of course this was before antes
sepsis so

141
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,429
a lot of patients got infected

142
00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:53,379
was not a good thing

143
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,240
you there was a very good thing

144
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,180
and in anesthesiology departments and
hospitals worldwide now

145
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,210
october sixteenth

146
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,119
is celebrated as either day you may have
parties

147
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:07,110
nadi for parties but they do have
parties

148
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,090
alguna vez celebrating this thing

149
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:09,639
palm

150
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,540
mortenson headstone and mt auburn
cemetery in cambridge massachusetts

151
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,849
celebrates him as the man who abolished
pain forever

152
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,199
uh... really quite something

153
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,460
poem which had a picture of it

154
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,940
anybody ever goes to cambridge

155
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,930
if your jogging through mobile bird
cemetery watch out for the headstone

156
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,650
take a photograph and send it to me

157
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,289
anyway always be all that with the uh...
discover with with the documentation

158
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,539
at harvard of course

159
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:41,539
all qualities are analgesia of the
though you know that uh... the

160
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:44,830
anesthesia than no technique began to
take off

161
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,360
and there are a number of development
saw that neither substance chloroform

162
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,689
was introduced for anesthesia surgery

163
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:53,809
uh... just a couple years later

164
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:58,310
queen victoria famously had root eight
child the prince leopold

165
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,169
or with chloroform

166
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:03,830
liked it a lot recommended it to
everybody

167
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,200
coral colored austrian ophthalmologist
introduced cocaine as an anesthetic for

168
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,779
uh... ice surgery

169
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:14,919
all you need to maybe four sigmund freud
worked on this but mostly freud took

170
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:16,749
cocaine

171
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:17,899
bomb

172
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:18,440
then

173
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,479
all people got the idea that you've got
anesthesia would go better be more

174
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,969
reliable if you pre medicaid the patient
with morphine

175
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:26,550
ald

176
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,370
and then dot henri paul said called
introduce below of cocaine for the

177
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,599
purposes of local anesthesia

178
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,840
injecting cocaine right into a nerve

179
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,610
onto to delwip

180
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,919
same thing happened with corning

181
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,570
uh... with spinal out of the anesthesia

182
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,699
so why do you all of them by goldman mid
to late eighteen eighties

183
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,680
anesthesia chemical anesthesia was
everywhere

184
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,540
all but it wasn't always used
interestingly

185
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,009
on there were a lot of all of the on one
of our debates within the medical

186
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:59,749
community bellwether about when it was
appropriate to use on an anesthesia and

187
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:02,660
when it was inappropriate to use
anesthesia

188
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:02,950
home

189
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,140
a debate that's blood

190
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,610
summarize our wonderful book all by a
sociologist of historian of science

191
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,750
on call the calculus of suffering

192
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,500
bunch country road who should have their
pain relieved and who shouldn't they're

193
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,030
being relieved

194
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,860
and uh... to make a long story short

195
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,130
all of the mail positions of the
nineteenth century got the idea in their

196
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,750
heads that

197
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,210
it would be really good for women to
experienced pain during childbirth

198
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:33,290
all because that would uh... increase
their bonding with their infants

199
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,600
not sure exactly how that was supposed
to work but that's what that's what

200
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,870
that's anyway what they go

201
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,400
what they argued

202
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,370
okay in the twentieth century at all to
get new although for the further

203
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,189
developments are in anesthesia

204
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:49,850
on film people begin to use sedative are
drugs for the rapid induction of

205
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,340
anesthesia uterine chloroform take
awhile to put the patient under

206
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,579
with barbiturates like all the sodium
pentothal abetted by other things

207
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:03,089
newer drugs like propyl fault all you
can actually induce on the anesthesia

208
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,190
loss of consciousness very very very
quickly

209
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,779
alm and a bugaboo but though what one
problem remain

210
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,760
which wasn't even though the patient was
unconscious

211
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,050
still there were all of the reflexive
responses

212
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,960
almost all of the on the body

213
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,250
to what is used for mister quinn cold

214
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,800
surgical stimulation

215
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,500
and our people wanted to get rid of that
so they started introducing

216
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,260
archer rar redirect lives

217
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,020
all four muscle relaxation so the
patient as i said it is not just

218
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,690
unconscious

219
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,550
but also

220
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,120
of effectively paralyzed on the
operating alone

221
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,520
on the operating table

222
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,310
so it won't be any reflexive responses

223
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,600
wind on when the cutting

224
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,190
palm

225
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,529
then a whole bunch of new are inhalation
allegiance were introduced to supplant

226
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,360
the ether and chloroform which argues
very much anymore

227
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,160
substances like isoflurane and flooring

228
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:03,020
or people started using home or on
intravenous or opi lloyds for very rapid

229
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,679
called the analgesia

230
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,690
you'll see you know home

231
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,900
uh... references in the literature to
controlled substances like fennel and

232
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,260
some fat no

233
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,630
then regional anesthesia paralyzing
other than a surprising just one part of

234
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,680
the body of supposed to

235
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,100
or person

236
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,609
and a conscious sedation about which
i've talked

237
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:24,480
bangalore along

238
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,930
a couple weeks ago

239
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,839
where the patient is actually conscious

240
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,809
but sedated

241
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:31,040
feels no pain and has no memory

242
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,240
on personal memory afterwards

243
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,920
modern anesthetic and i dont technique
looks like this is what the positions

244
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,790
called balanced and have done that

245
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,520
although that anesthesia

246
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,870
and it doesn't involve just giving a
single drug to induce consciousness

247
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,190
but it involves giving the patient oval
cocktail of drugs that have all whole

248
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,500
host of different affects

249
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,950
so for example

250
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,500
patients will read all the bill while
routinely gava pre-operative dose of

251
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,330
laid off

252
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,180
all good

253
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,740
beds of as a team some kind of sedative
drug which is intended

254
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,730
are both to reduce the patient's
pre-operative anxiety

255
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,600
and also to facilitate the induction of
all

256
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,200
of anesthesia

257
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,969
then v all of the patients will be given
some anesthetic eight int

258
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:20,489
uh... and inhale a drug like home dot
like gold club

259
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,860
isoflow ring

260
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,190
or a dollar

261
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,870
all of the intravenous drug like san
fernando

262
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,039
to actually induce anesthesia

263
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,039
and cause laws orval

264
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,640
was awareness

265
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,080
patients are also given a muscle
relaxant again one of these uh... cure

266
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,950
rory

267
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,690
derived or the drugs

268
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,260
to alban calm the operative or area

269
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,549
because some of the patients effectively
paralyzed the patient that has to be

270
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:46,980
artificially breast berated

271
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,540
during the procedure so there's old

272
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,660
uh... you know

273
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,780
uh...

274
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,680
this good too

275
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,490
uh... it belongs

276
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,459
and then the boa patients will also get
towards the end of the procedure

277
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,149
on the day bobo list of some analgesic

278
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:05,870
on the agent that's intended to through
will ward off post-operative pain

279
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,960
because after recover from surgery of
course for those of you had surgery the

280
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,120
surgeries not over

281
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,100
on people the moderate pulling your ribs
apart to do it all sorts of things and

282
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,070
it hurts

283
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:20,120
uh... and it hurts while they're doing
it

284
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,250
anesthetized and it hurts

285
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,030
phone finished doing it as well

286
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,230
but in any event that's what we do now
all for apprentice the showed the hole

287
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,510
cocktail of drugs

288
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,270
and what will happen is that a typically
vienna the anesthesiologist would give

289
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,770
some will make a pre operative business

290
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,570
get informed consent for the procedure

291
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,260
administer all it was some kind of
sedative premeditation

292
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,530
palm song

293
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,330
of which i did it as i say again is
intended to

294
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,050
kind of help the anesthesia alcohol
along

295
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,930
and then there will be the induction of
anesthesia itself

296
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,430
that happens and wanted to basic ways

297
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,440
there's either what's known as rapid
sequence induction

298
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,350
which shall involves the intravenous
administration the obvious almost

299
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,560
synthetic or

300
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,630
synthetic opiates

301
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,030
or something like twelve the proper
fault

302
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,989
all four

303
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:10,970
on slower

304
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,100
all mass conduction with oprah dog

305
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,290
breathing mask

306
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,700
over the patients face

307
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,490
and administered things like nitrous
oxide you know at all the uh... in

308
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,790
oxygen or

309
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,160
so foreigner whatever

310
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,610
and it's at that point that they start
we are giving the muscle relaxant

311
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,110
to calm the operative roman coming up
with a area

312
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,260
and then once you've got the muscle
relaxant thing patient has to be

313
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,520
connected to a ventilator for artificial
respiration

314
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,270
then you maintain the general anesthesia
throughout the procedure

315
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,269
either by administering

316
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:47,930
albeit gun nitrous oxide and oxygen was
very common or solve all inhalants like

317
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,390
isoflurane

318
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,540
or by giving the home and intravenous
narcotics all-white complex internal

319
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,839
that goes on throughout the entire

320
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,520
opportu procedure as needed

321
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,539
and then at the end of the procedure

322
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:06,390
they give you all of the did you were
drug that'll reversal muscle relaxation

323
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,670
also that you could breathe on your own
again

324
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,569
all the

325
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:11,080
remove the ventilator

326
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,650
and then beyond

327
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:18,450
the anesthetic agents themselves either
the inhalants or the intravenous agent

328
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,839
they just wash out of the body

329
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,970
so you just recover from those naturally
they're not chemically weavers

330
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,170
and then as i say right at the end of
the procedure is very common

331
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,850
for a patient to receive some kind of
intravenous

332
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,090
on narcotic

333
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:35,640
that's intended to deal with
post-operative pain that's the procedure

334
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,260
all and it works pretty nicely

335
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,089
calm

336
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:43,380
and it will induces what the auger
positions now paul

337
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,370
at the very

338
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,150
nicest phrase of the world but uh...
what they call a controlled coma

339
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,350
as opposed to what uncontrolled komal
about which we'll talk on wednesday

340
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,020
that has these elements to it sedation

341
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,030
okay the patient is calm

342
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,310
all walks of consciousness

343
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,070
fault book talk about how we measure
loss of consciousness in a moment

344
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,709
and then immobility

345
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:09,290
that's uh... measured both by a lock of
voluntary motor behavior which actually

346
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,150
comes from the anesthetic agent

347
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,880
all four of reflexive responses

348
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,960
which our own

349
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,810
inhibited by diesel by these muscle
relaxant so that's what the procedure

350
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,410
looks like

351
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,990
and if you think about those combat
continue of consciousness that though

352
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,760
that we talked about all of our earlier

353
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,630
sorry can't get this done any further

354
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,210
wakefulness on one-dimensional awareness
on the other dimension

355
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,729
general anesthesia is commonly located

356
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:41,350
or were right about there

357
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,040
there's no wakefulness you or in some
sense and sleep you're not going for

358
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,110
your normal sleep cycles

359
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,390
or even up asians who are invested prize
for very long periods of time

360
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,360
don't go through anything like normal
sleep cycle and all the whole point of

361
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,080
this

362
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,860
is ought to run to the patient unaware

363
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,760
orble of what's going on

364
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,440
so we'll talk about komal

365
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,310
mark on them

366
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,400
on wednesday

367
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,030
now there are a whole bunch of
alternative procedures for general

368
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,170
anesthesia just wanted garb of the touch
base with those

369
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,119
we're not going to talk about those now

370
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,279
because they don't interested they don't
to all or that represent any kind of

371
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,699
loss or alteration of consciousness

372
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:25,079
as we usually uh... as you and as we
usually think about it the reason

373
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,670
anesthesia is of interest and of course
like this

374
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,070
is because

375
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,840
anesthesia is gottlieb is commonly used
by safe a la suffers

376
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,610
to artwork

377
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,920
what consciousness isn't

378
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,520
ka justices what you've got when you're
not anesthetized ka justices what you've

379
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,620
got when you're not asleep

380
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,010
also are what we want to do is talk
about

381
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,020
conscious although anesthesia as a laws
orval

382
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,040
the loss of consciousness

383
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,910
our couple although a point about

384
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,590
how it works

385
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,210
and the first thing to be said is

386
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,070
we don't have any clear idea

387
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,769
how anesthesia

388
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:03,770
homeworks

389
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:04,370
palm

390
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,870
when dad and that that anesthesia was
originally introduced in the all

391
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,750
mid-nineteenth century

392
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,020
or both of them

393
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,120
purely as what

394
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,170
the positions like to call an empirical
treatment

395
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,799
empirical treatments in medicine or
treatments that are known to work

396
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,890
what whose mechanism is not known

397
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,810
aspirin

398
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,070
is pretty much an empirical treatment we
know it gives pain relief but we don't

399
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,510
know

400
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,590
really know how aspirin works or
theories but

401
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,520
that's it

402
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,360
although

403
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,580
uh... but of course

404
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,830
they want to have some sense of what
uh... about of however seizure works

405
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,460
and there had the hub for a long time

406
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,030
been all some moralist informal theories
around

407
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,369
one of which is that

408
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:51,240
all of the analgesic agents alter the
dynamics of the are newer on membrane

409
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,520
so what's the interfere with the
polarization and all of that

410
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,270
there's another theory that says well b
l practice and that uh...

411
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,780
within is at the cell body it's on the
acts on a dog

412
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,309
that it interferes with the transmission

413
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:08,370
over what all the neural impulse down
the exxon

414
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:12,670
and then all of their theories of
anesthesia that hold that it interferes

415
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,440
with so that the transmission

416
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,200
either the release of neuro transmitters

417
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,010
into the syntax for the pre synoptic nor
on

418
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,200
or the uptake

419
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,310
barbara transmitter

420
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,860
all by the postsynaptic nora

421
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,800
now when you think about it

422
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,160
half a second

423
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,830
what else could it be

424
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,720
however dependencies or possibly work

425
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,190
something like that right

426
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,070
either you interfere with the
polarization or you oradour you

427
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,019
interfere with son after transmission

428
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:46,780
there isn't anything else that's going
on in the nervous system besides

429
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,970
people recession

430
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,710
and soon after transmission so it's
pretty obvious

431
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,520
that anesthesia interferes with one or
the other

432
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,950
what although above major topical
anesthesia research nowadays are lots of

433
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,940
people working on this

434
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,210
trying to figure out exactly are exactly
how it works

435
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:05,990
also

436
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,600
uh... they're a bunch of single pencil
called single process theories

437
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:16,600
one is that guardian helen battle geez x
like nitrous oxide and dong doens't fml

438
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:23,460
on dissolved in the fat cells all vet
that altman so that surround the uh...

439
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,679
the cell body of the door on

440
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,990
and basically of uh... screw up the ion
channel so that so you don't get the

441
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,270
polarization

442
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,059
and then there's another our civil
process period says not that's not right

443
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,090
has got nothing to do with fat cells

444
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,460
but rather that analgesic agents

445
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,880
all bind on to the proteins onto the nor
on

446
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,530
and in that way somehow interfere with
synaptic transmission

447
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,090
fairly standard theories now

448
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,639
but again on there's a lot of debate
about this in the literature and we

449
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:55,820
don't really have a good idea how these
things work

450
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,990
and then there are these are there is a
newer dual process period general

451
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,710
anesthesia

452
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,230
that says that

453
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,679
some analgesic agents

454
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,309
inhibit excitatory neurotransmitters

455
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,810
whereas

456
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,159
anna javel anesthetic agents

457
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:12,630
fault-tolerant

458
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,080
potentiated the activity of inhibitory
neurotransmitters

459
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,420
but again if you think about it for half
a second

460
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,650
got to be one of the dura transmitters
come in june for right

461
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,769
they come in

462
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:26,940
excitatory neurotransmitters an
inhibitory neurotransmitters

463
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,450
and if you're getting him hit in
addition of neural transmission

464
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,190
you're either going to get it by
inhibiting excitatory neuro transmitters

465
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,420
or buy

466
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,610
inhibiting

467
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,430
i don't bother all applaud the
potentiated vividly remember a

468
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,470
transmitter so

469
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:46,100
we have a very good idea of idea about
how the nervous system works the

470
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,350
mechanics of it the electrochemistry of
it

471
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,500
but exactly how

472
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,309
bill

473
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,429
exactly how org

474
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:55,029
analgesics work

475
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:58,549
is just something we don't yet no so
those of you were contemplating going on

476
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,170
the medical school

477
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,420
although palm

478
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,360
if you want to be famous

479
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,760
regardless

480
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,950
a really good

481
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,900
believed in the work on

482
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,370
alm

483
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,040
i'm gonna skip this this is just than
anybody is really interested in this

484
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,820
kind of uh... kendall

485
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,950
inflicted on yourself on your own time

486
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,250
hall but of roger penrose great barbara
british scientist has suggested on

487
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,750
uh... that though we can understand how
when assad anesthetics work in terms of

488
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,290
his quantum theory of consciousness

489
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,720
which is far as i can tell is just
basically a series of metaphors

490
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,680
for all

491
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,330
of unconsciousness

492
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,540
all but in any event

493
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,010
the idea here

494
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,440
worked out with

495
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,260
un-american anesthesiologists to work on
or off

496
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,340
is that

497
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,049
palm

498
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:48,990
there is

499
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,759
did this is a meron so there is your
cell body

500
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:53,110
here's your acts on

501
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,570
here's your dog terminal fiber

502
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,100
and there are called

503
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,280
uh... passageways applaud inside the
acts on

504
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,929
move chemical other chemicals up and
down

505
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:05,269
although the meron

506
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:06,710
and they suggested

507
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,409
that all of these micro tubules setter
inside the axe honor where the action is

508
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:15,600
for anesthesia but they don't have any
evidence for this either

509
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,760
ons just appalled this is an interesting
theory about about all this and what

510
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,370
makes it more interesting is that it's
couched in terms of quantum mechanics

511
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,059
home

512
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:29,290
leading of the church elan's of poland
patricia

513
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,059
to complain

514
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:35,460
what penrose and his friends are doing
is explaining one mystery the mystery of

515
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,040
consciousness with another mystery the
mystery of quantum mechanics

516
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,490
and that sounds about right to me

517
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,670
so okay

518
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,300
let's go back to consciousness here we
know who but don't think that uh... we

519
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,960
which bill discussed what amnesty at
adult the anesthesia does

520
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,370
how do you know

521
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,659
how do you know the truth

522
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:58,679
all of them that the patient is lying
out there upon the surgical table

523
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,180
really is on really is unconscious

524
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:07,940
for a long time all surgeons a land and
anesthesiologist really all the relied

525
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,390
on what you might call clinical or
behavioral assessment

526
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,800
of consciousness

527
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,440
one of which was a lack of response

528
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,230
deanna soup the end of the
anesthesiologist would say to the

529
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,809
patient

530
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:19,750
can you hear me

531
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,840
if you can hear me respond

532
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,470
which isn't easy to do when

533
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,640
you're paralyzed on the table

534
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,929
palm the but it

535
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:33,159
things are working well at least the
patient consent advice i can hear you

536
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:34,640
something's not working

537
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,810
or or they look at lack of response to
surgical stimulation went the first

538
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,690
incision if there's

539
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,520
some kind of movement from the patient
if they follow

540
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,040
not completely anesthetized

541
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,559
followed

542
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,730
then fog interestingly the other clinic
the other aspects of clinical assessment

543
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,900
of out of beneficial occur after the
surgeries over

544
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:00,180
it's very common either for the
anesthesiologist or for a l nurse in the

545
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,470
recovery room to ask patients

546
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,110
if they were aware of anything during
the procedure

547
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,820
did they feel any pain during the
procedure

548
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,100
paula and if the remembered anything
happening

549
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,290
during the procedure

550
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,450
so on

551
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,340
it's through this kind of

552
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,020
all posteriori lie order

553
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,640
uh... kind of barbara retrospective

554
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,620
of report

555
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,370
that they understand really bad things
on things are working

556
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:29,350
all recently however there have been of
annulled broke more faultless both

557
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,380
scientifically based all the way is a
monitoring surgical

558
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,970
or surgical awareness

559
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,890
but even so it's important to point out
that although we don't have a very good

560
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,550
idea about how

561
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,820
anesthesia o works in terms of his

562
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,950
on them terms of his neural mechanisms

563
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,710
it's very clear that it does work

564
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,530
almost everybody who goes above the
huard who has had a seizure

565
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,940
uh... for surgery

566
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,440
all reports

567
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,789
didn't hear anything didn't experience
anything don't remember anything more

568
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:03,320
laws and in pain or whatever

569
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,130
all far fewer than one percent of
surgical patients report

570
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,360
any awareness

571
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,460
of the procedure

572
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,100
are during surgery

573
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,220
all maybe point uh... look good

574
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,730
uh... point two percent of general
surgical cases

575
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,040
even if you look at medical malpractice
claims

576
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,460
fewer than two percent of all

577
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,450
all resolved medical malpractice claims

578
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,699
involved i think that any claim of
surgical where so

579
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:31,380
surgical overdoses

580
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,950
we could do very very very well

581
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,630
or in madison

582
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,950
alva

583
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,250
that that's probably as good a nap of
the there's good evidence that you can

584
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,470
imagine

585
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,320
there are some cases where you do get
some surgical workers

586
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,940
and that is when the positions have used
have deliberately employed

587
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,500
are very light

588
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,850
plane of surgical anesthesia for various
reasons

589
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:02,420
on softened on in obstetrics personal
caesarean section for example

590
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,950
because although that will put about
ascetic

591
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,540
drugs well they're their drugs right

592
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,350
and you want to keep them up away from
the broke from the uh... developing

593
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,440
fetus if you can

594
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,179
all

595
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:18,070
all of the white plains that the seizure
are often used in trauma surgery and

596
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,390
that's because

597
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,120
many

598
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,289
thoughts on that anesthetic agents

599
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:24,960
require that the patient have a song

600
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,930
minimum level of blood pressure

601
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,280
and if the person's bleeding profusely
from say a gunshot wound

602
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,139
nor or something like that

603
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:33,700
that's not going to happen

604
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:39,190
in the same outlook for the same reason
a lot of draws a cardiac surgery

605
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,540
wised up with a very white plate of
anesthesia because you just can't

606
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,340
deliver enough of the stuff

607
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,059
under those circumstances

608
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,539
and in rural surgery

609
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:51,220
very often neuro surgery that's done
with the patient wide awake

610
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,560
also that the uh... positions karen

611
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,220
kind of probe of the brain and

612
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:00,330
get the patient to talk about what's
going on

613
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,740
all of those uh... surgeons

614
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,280
use

615
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,269
general anesthesia

616
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:11,260
it seems to work on really really really
well

617
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,250
fall one or index and kind of indirect
index of consciousness

618
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,720
that all of that issue dot

619
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,180
anesthesiologists used quite a bit

620
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,490
is known as the p_r_ s cheese score

621
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,690
and that's based on our understanding of
how the order nomic nervous system

622
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,500
responds to stress

623
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,429
also

624
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:33,309
what's interesting here is that the
automatic nervous system

625
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:36,779
which we usually don't think of having
anything to do with consciousness

626
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,950
is actually being used as a indirect
measure

627
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,980
of consciousness

628
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,280
on positions will monitor the patient's
blood pressure that's the p

629
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,540
and heart rate that's the art

630
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,700
they'll look for signs of sweating
either on the brawl or of the in their

631
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,410
hands

632
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:57,490
or the secretion of cheers that's the
t_v_

633
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:02,070
all glad to have patient shows any of
those polled signs of auto nomic nervous

634
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,660
system response

635
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,050
surgical stimulation

636
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,070
then they'll jack up

637
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,370
the the the anesthesia

638
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,240
all but this again is very clear that
the very indirect measure

639
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,239
called for the help of consciousness

640
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:16,970
the basic idea being that

641
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,920
if the patient

642
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,669
was in pain if the patient were
distressed in any way

643
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:25,399
the sympathetic branch of the or a
number of nervous system would kick in

644
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,610
and create arby's r

645
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,850
these p_r_ resting

646
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,330
uh... sign

647
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,080
so if you look at their own doug if you
look at surgical records for example you

648
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,570
will often see a reference

649
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:40,169
to the patient's p_r_ rescue score from
time to time during the uh...

650
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:42,300
during the procedure

651
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,210
but of course it's an indirect measure
of consciousness right which would

652
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,010
really like to have is a direct measure
of consciousness

653
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:50,780
that at all

654
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,930
that uh... monitor something closer to
the central nervous system and we've got

655
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,320
a couple of those

656
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,399
all here is old one

657
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:03,070
based on the event related potential
sometimes known as the evoked potential

658
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,059
talked about this a little bit before

659
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:07,850
this is a bit of a system a signal

660
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,520
algunas or basically a reflexive
response

661
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:15,520
to any kind of any kind of stimulus they
can be an auditory stimulus

662
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,919
the sort of the anesthesiologist will
put your phones over the patient's head

663
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:20,910
and all

664
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,920
play yard

665
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,039
traynor beeps

666
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,100
uh... into uh... into the ear it can be
visual stimulus or not usually in

667
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,149
surgery because patient's eyes are
closed

668
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:34,780
are very good very commonly it's a
cement a sensory stimulus

669
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,880
attach a little cough

670
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,809
to the patient's wrist and deliver

671
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:40,860
very very very brief electrical shocks

672
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,549
and looking at the uh...

673
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,520
and theo

674
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,740
central nervous system response onto
these this is what uh... that related

675
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,870
potential looks like kind of a typical
dot related potential

676
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,710
we're out here's what the stimulus

677
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,950
is applied

678
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:00,800
i thought was a milliseconds just one
second later and you see this bunch of

679
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,600
positive and negative of the deflections

680
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,240
we basically all break-up we ought not
have been related potential of the three

681
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,889
components

682
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:10,680
there is a early component

683
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,080
all representing about

684
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,299
ten milliseconds first ten milliseconds
after

685
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,220
all of the after the stimulus

686
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,309
which reflects brainstem

687
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:19,980
responses

688
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,789
to the stimulus

689
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:24,630
and then there's a mid latency component

690
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:29,110
out to about a hundred milliseconds a
tenth of a second that represents all

691
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:33,090
the sub subcortical responses like
responsible for all of us

692
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,230
to the of

693
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,460
to the stimulus

694
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,679
and then bs

695
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:40,210
late components after about a hundred
milliseconds out to a thousand

696
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:46,070
uh... milliseconds represent god organ
cortical processing of the stimulus

697
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,630
and what cause surgeons will do is ma
continually maku what anesthesiologist

698
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,320
will do

699
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,289
is continually monitor the patients

700
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:56,790
they're related potential to

701
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,360
odd to this tenuous

702
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,169
and they'll try to apply

703
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:00,769
all of that

704
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:03,320
uh... and uh... anesthesia

705
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,019
the to adapt to a degree

706
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:07,200
that will abolish

707
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,840
entirely

708
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,299
the late components of the abed related
potential

709
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:15,310
so essentially abolishing cortical
processing of the stimulus

710
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,660
and also

711
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,960
delayed amid lakeview components of the

712
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,929
these waves

713
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:22,340
or displays way out here

714
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,670
that's a very very very common

715
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,900
lol all of them all the technique for
monitoring responsible anesthesia

716
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,989
the general ideas if you're not getting
these late cortical responses

717
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:35,529
the patient really is unconscious you
can see

718
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:37,120
uh... you can see the largest

719
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,480
uh... of that

720
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,270
here is another technique

721
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,070
that anesthesiologists used to

722
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,169
to monitor the success of our of
analgesia

723
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:49,919
based on

724
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,320
on of another

725
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,770
all reading from the g known as the jeep
power spectrum

726
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,740
beall

727
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,880
dot the person the electrical activity
of the brain can be broken up into a

728
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,950
number of different bands all talk about
this

729
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,520
next week at in more detail will be talk
about sleep

730
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,490
here is a so-called delta

731
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,610
which is just a couple of cycles per
second

732
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,300
and update a rhythm about five to seven

733
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,080
uh... of those cycles of them cycles per
second

734
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,330
here's an alpha rhythm

735
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,110
about eight to twelve cycles per second

736
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,490
and debate a rhythm

737
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,660
eighteen to thirty

738
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,260
cycles per second

739
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:29,970
called

740
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:35,320
alpha you've the wiki nije basically is
a mix all of the alpha and beta activity

741
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,780
as you fall asleep you begin to show
things like delta

742
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,670
and uh... and theta activity

743
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,600
so whatever physiologist will sometimes
do

744
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,950
is continually monitor the patient
c_j_d_

745
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,180
and don't administer aesthetic agents

746
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,040
so as to

747
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,249
the median

748
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:57,779
all frequency of the persons e_g_ five
down two oh two or three cycles per

749
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:58,980
second

750
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,890
something looks more like this

751
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,739
and a lot

752
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,020
less than this

753
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,490
and they'll never let

754
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,440
the patient to eugene

755
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,250
fallback creep up into

756
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,110
into the althorp

757
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,819
uh... the ban just endured

758
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:14,319
that's that's pretty clear the air kind
of

759
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:14,940
lapsing into

760
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,200
uh...

761
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,129
deal awake so basically what they do is
they monitor the g

762
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:20,809
randall

763
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,279
and keep it looking more like this

764
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:25,019
not flat

765
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:28,499
goes that's bad

766
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,560
very low level

767
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,020
on that very low level of activity and
again the idea here is

768
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,609
the closer you are diverse

769
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:36,859
the more unconscious

770
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:43,859
more unconscious you are

771
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,549
yeah i would be one of these

772
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:01,289
appear id

773
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:01,890
yes

774
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,099
in principle you could do that

775
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:10,650
whether you can actually do it in fact
or not is another question entirely

776
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,640
beginning and then late nineteen sixties
there was although a lot of interest in

777
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,959
all of the association between

778
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:21,230
alf activity in the g_m_ certain
meditative

779
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,339
although met meditative states will talk
about this when we talk about meditation

780
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:26,709
all you know

781
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:28,300
how do you know

782
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,070
embarrassing

783
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,430
of the pleasure of chasing a very famous
zen

784
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,970
across my college campus

785
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,259
trying to slap

786
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,349
electrodes on into

787
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:39,029
look at his e_g_

788
00:35:39,029 --> 00:35:39,480
home

789
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,089
he kept saying you know with a very
charming way he had

790
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:48,619
but in any event yallop said the
principle you could do that

791
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:52,659
whether you can actually trained people
to increase the amount of alf activity

792
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:53,710
in the region

793
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,659
that's highly debatable

794
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:56,989
highly debatable

795
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,130
on whether you can actually trained
people to generate

796
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:04,089
just fade activity or or or or delta
activity

797
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:06,529
i don't know how good that literature is
either

798
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:10,109
to be really honest with you because we
think about per second your training

799
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:13,890
some way to do something deliberately

800
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,709
that they're supposed to show when
they're asleep

801
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:19,079
so that's not going to be easy

802
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,079
alms so all of the did there there to
set a separate things have to keep the

803
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:23,559
the

804
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:25,869
two things have to keep separate here

805
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:27,129
can people do it

806
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:28,309
to begin with

807
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:31,090
and the second uh... is home

808
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,369
if they can do it

809
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:33,119
we old

810
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,720
that pattern of the g

811
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,920
really induce an altered state of
consciousness as it's sometimes

812
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,949
expected

813
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:41,899
it was a rhetorical question

814
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,290
and they have not gotten

815
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,670
a lot of

816
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,630
actual systematic research

817
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,199
attention

818
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:49,369
there are claims out there

819
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:55,079
or you know if you would do so delta
state your be about

820
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,699
feel like you're now rafe type dance
party or something like that

821
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:00,320
candomble o

822
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,920
are just don't know

823
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,119
where the laboratory research is

824
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,730
but anyway that's the idea so what what
they will do is

825
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,450
bill monitor this they'll try to make
the with the patient c_j_ look more like

826
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,439
this

827
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:15,299
must like this

828
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:16,159
palm

829
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,219
here's another technique that bug dubbed
that we see a lot now even now in

830
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:21,130
medical use

831
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:25,279
this is a proprietary technique known as
by spectral analysis

832
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:27,999
all and what happens here is that

833
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,499
there's this little machine

834
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:34,739
that monitors a bunch of all volunteer
from parameters of the g and there's a

835
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:36,969
proprietary algorithm

836
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:41,660
that this format aspect medical systems
has generated through their all you've

837
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,569
done through their industrial research

838
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:47,449
that tells the that tells the
anesthesiologist

839
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:50,739
or whether the patient actually is on
conscious or not

840
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:55,299
because this is proprietary and based on
industrial research we don't know

841
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:59,819
exactly how the by spectral analysis
works rocket

842
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,100
here's how we think it works here's how
it advertising were the the board

843
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:09,019
there's this thing called the biggest
algorithm flights pectoral algorithm

844
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:09,719
tracks

845
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,100
how much high-frequency activity there
is in the g

846
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,849
say beta activity

847
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:17,319
it looks at

848
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:20,880
all low-frequency activity and
especially the synchronization of

849
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,679
low-frequency activity across

850
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:26,839
parts caldwell above the bottom parts of
the cortex

851
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:27,970
their tracks

852
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,390
how long and how often

853
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,390
the g appears to be

854
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:36,869
nearly suppressed again not flat line
but merely are suppressed

855
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:41,039
and the based on these kinds of
parameters calculates

856
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,759
what's known as a barista factor all
index

857
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:46,589
which goes all uh... basically a zero

858
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:48,140
to one hundred scale

859
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,999
one hundred means your as a way cuz you
are now

860
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:52,879
or maybe even more awake

861
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:56,589
on zero armies you are not awake and all

862
00:38:56,589 --> 00:38:58,170
your brain dead

863
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,269
all

864
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:00,790
and what they want to do

865
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,259
is to basically

866
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:05,769
keep the persons by spectral index

867
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:09,659
however it's calculated based on these
parameters

868
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:11,900
down below around sixty

869
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,229
on old zero to one hundred scaling

870
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:21,229
gambar nih

871
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,680
old don't do that

872
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,519
also

873
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:30,900
dawes studies with almond with or
research volunteers

874
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,609
have shown that all of

875
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:36,240
if you can reduce a person's by spectral
index two eighty six

876
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,499
on this one hundred-point scale

877
00:39:38,499 --> 00:39:42,049
all you get about fifty percent
reduction in recall yet

878
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,480
applied the anesthetic agent

879
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,840
get there by spectral index down to
about eighty six min chocolates the

880
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,929
words

881
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:51,129
get a fifty percent reduction of recall

882
00:39:51,129 --> 00:39:54,220
ninety five percent reduction in recall
with radio on

883
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,439
uh...

884
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:57,599
by spectral index of sixty four

885
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,390
so the standard of care

886
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,880
is to keep the patients

887
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,150
all but all the by spectral index

888
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,619
below sixty

889
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,699
not too far below sixty

890
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:10,109
below sixty so again that's how

891
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:12,090
uh... anesthesia is monitored

892
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,519
and again

893
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,909
it makes sense

894
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:16,919
that uh... but that that this would work

895
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:19,240
the only problem with this and this is
used

896
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,930
all over the place i can tell you how
many surgeries are done using the by

897
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,829
spectral index

898
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:29,989
it so it is a proprietary algorithms and
dong do you know but research that's

899
00:40:29,989 --> 00:40:33,959
based on it is also a largely
proprietary so you've got a trust your

900
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:37,489
equipment manufacturer

901
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:41,509
speaking of trusting your equipment
manufacturer group of anesthesiology

902
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:46,349
researchers at mcgill university have
now introduce that anesthesia robot

903
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:49,210
home which they call mix sleepy

904
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,569
nick for mcgill

905
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:53,259
and sleepy for

906
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:55,869
and what makes weepy does is

907
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:58,759
completely automate the delivery of
anesthesia

908
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:02,619
uh... this is done with all of the depth
typically with

909
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:03,809
phone

910
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:05,599
that intravenous on it

911
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,219
analgesics

912
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:09,529
but what will happen is this is the
machine this is one week sleepy looks

913
00:41:09,529 --> 00:41:10,470
like

914
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:15,720
on and it's basically a computer program
that monitors various aspects of

915
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,989
although or that monitors the patient's
consciousness

916
00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:21,859
based on the kinds of things that i've
just go on that

917
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:23,389
that i've just discussed

918
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:26,390
and if the patient's consciousness
begins to come up a little bit

919
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,549
it'll administer

920
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:30,880
so more anesthetic agent until the
patient goes back down

921
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,189
and when the patient comes up a little
bit it doesn't do the ministers were to

922
00:41:34,189 --> 00:41:35,579
pick the patient backed out

923
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,469
and does the whole thing

924
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:38,289
automatically

925
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:39,689
so what does it do

926
00:41:39,689 --> 00:41:43,660
are good measures consciousness of all
in terms of by spectral index

927
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,409
but i just discussed

928
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:50,599
it though looks of muscle relax ation by
monitoring a variant obviate g_m_ g the

929
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:52,150
electoral myo graph

930
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:55,949
on sexually photo not electro but it's
the same kind of thing

931
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:59,530
and then uses are two aspects of the
p_r_ rescue score

932
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:02,839
as proxies all four all for pain

933
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:04,989
and as i say the whole thing now

934
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,039
our business is done

935
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:11,999
with automation there's still an
anesthesiologist or nurse-anesthetist

936
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:14,039
there to monitor the whole thing

937
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:16,699
but the claim is that you don't really
need

938
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:17,349
abadi

939
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:20,859
in there anymore that the machine will
do it

940
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:22,099
automatically

941
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:24,580
sleepy was introduced in two thousand
eight at macdill

942
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,409
in two thousand ten

943
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:31,959
onto participated along with a surgical
robot known as the veggie

944
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:34,520
in a uh... article about the
transatlantic

945
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,719
of prostate surgery

946
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,219
like them case of love

947
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:40,949
as she was operated on in italy

948
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:42,280
for all the

949
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,989
montreal

950
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:45,449
completely

951
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:49,479
analyses are robot and the surgical
robot

952
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:51,099
well that's cool

953
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:54,579
what can you say it's kind of
interesting

954
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:56,400
soviet that the other guy

955
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,839
monitoring a good news in a couple of
joy sticks

956
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:00,380
montreal

957
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,939
to actually do the prospect of me

958
00:43:02,939 --> 00:43:06,230
uh... all big sleepy also sitting in
montreal

959
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,379
was monitoring the patients

960
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:12,959
level of consciousness patient was in
italy

961
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:16,949
i'd was kind of a stone but it was kind
of interesting parting uh... for people

962
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:20,019
who do

963
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:25,099
also that's basically the story about
all of the bod anesthesia and how

964
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:28,430
consciousness is monitored i got one
more thing to say about all of this

965
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,210
but ordering questions about

966
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:35,729
monitoring of consciousness

967
00:43:35,729 --> 00:43:38,719
of this whole thing would go a lot
better perhaps if we had neither had a

968
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:41,559
good neural correlates consciousness

969
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:42,630
which we don't

970
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:46,289
or if we had a really good theory about
how anesthesia worked

971
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:47,799
which we don't

972
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:49,249
palm

973
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:51,209
what people do

974
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:55,999
seems to make sense and we definitely no

975
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:57,940
okay so

976
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,789
adequately anaesthetized patients are
out of it they are not aware of what's

977
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:03,729
going on or around them

978
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:07,419
which raises all sorts of interesting
questions about well just hulond aware

979
00:44:07,419 --> 00:44:08,999
or are they

980
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:11,469
palm my laboratory ulm

981
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:14,210
the estes question in terms of bulk

982
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:17,200
implicit memory

983
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,000
arrange some surgical events

984
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,590
of four patients

985
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:24,310
called what would they show the back of
a show explicit memory for those

986
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:25,239
surgical of ends

987
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:26,279
by definition

988
00:44:26,279 --> 00:44:29,969
because we've got explicit memory you're
not adequately anesthetized

989
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:31,130
the question is

990
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:35,340
if the adequate anesthesia abolish is
explicit memory doesn't abolish implicit

991
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,879
memory as well

992
00:44:36,879 --> 00:44:40,240
so of when i was a diverse array result
no

993
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,479
we got a hold of

994
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:43,730
once patients and all of the word

995
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:48,280
coming in for elective surgery are
getting isoflurane all further

996
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,339
anesthetic

997
00:44:49,339 --> 00:44:51,100
and while they were in surgery

998
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,809
we put your phones on them

999
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:54,109
and played to a bunch of

1000
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:58,410
or paris or suits of the former host of
water overnight and so on

1001
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:01,820
we're just play them over and over and
over again for the duration of the

1002
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,539
surgery

1003
00:45:02,539 --> 00:45:05,379
average of about of garbage about
fifteen minutes

1004
00:45:05,379 --> 00:45:09,209
and then although i have to they out
came out of surgery after they woke up

1005
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:10,420
on the recovery room

1006
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,309
we gave them a bunch of memory tests

1007
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:17,329
and or first was a cube recall test
present them with all shins at what was

1008
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:20,389
the word paired with

1009
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:22,559
tell us that

1010
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,369
palm

1011
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:24,749
for recognition

1012
00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:28,709
we asked me to go to the performed
recognition tested before very poorly on

1013
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:30,669
the recognition test as well

1014
00:45:30,669 --> 00:45:33,180
but what we give them a free association
test

1015
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,190
while presenting them with the word like
oceana say what's the first were the

1016
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,519
comes to mind

1017
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:38,510
lo and behold

1018
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,560
they were more likely to give

1019
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,930
the word that that

1020
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,589
q had been paired with

1021
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:45,720
all of the during surgery

1022
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,739
or that they were

1023
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:50,439
on neutral paris it had not been
presented to them

1024
00:45:50,439 --> 00:45:53,379
so there's a prime in effect there it's
about ten percent prime minister act

1025
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:56,399
which is about what you get on in the
use of uh...

1026
00:45:56,399 --> 00:45:58,229
in these circumstances

1027
00:45:58,229 --> 00:45:59,910
on suggesting that

1028
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:06,469
anesthesia by definition abolish is
explicit memory for surgical of ends

1029
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:10,279
calm or under some of the under some
circumstances of these

1030
00:46:10,279 --> 00:46:14,089
on seems not to had the same effect on
implicit memory

1031
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:15,419
so something

1032
00:46:15,419 --> 00:46:17,349
can percolate

1033
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:19,630
or even though the patient is all

1034
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:23,950
is adequately uh... is adequately
anesthetized final clinical

1035
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,679
and on and monitoring criteria

1036
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:29,099
skip over this one

1037
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:31,019
here is a review

1038
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:35,079
of the slurs your group our laboratory
was the first

1039
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:38,550
convincingly demonstrate spirited was
the memory of general anesthesia

1040
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,170
they've been a lot of these studies
since then

1041
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:41,569
alm

1042
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:45,489
this is from a review by miracle and
damon showing that

1043
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:47,369
on average you get out

1044
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:48,929
small affect

1045
00:46:48,929 --> 00:46:51,919
on implicit memory

1046
00:46:51,919 --> 00:46:55,779
that you know general anesthesia it's
preserved but fully preserved a little

1047
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:56,309
bit

1048
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:59,309
so mason has preserved role

1049
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:01,559
the patient is a mess supplies

1050
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:05,319
of the affects our strongest if you test
within twelve hours of the surgery and

1051
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:06,989
get progressively

1052
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:09,529
and uh... and get progressively weaker

1053
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:11,170
now this is all something that

1054
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:14,700
uh... the raise some very interesting
questions here

1055
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:19,099
but what we've got is argues that
implicit memory test

1056
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:24,109
all what i'd prefer to think of this as
solve at that is an instance of implicit

1057
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:24,809
perception

1058
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:28,539
not of implicit

1059
00:47:28,539 --> 00:47:33,389
because you may remember although mir
talk about explicitly implicit memory

1060
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:34,759
we'd thought

1061
00:47:34,759 --> 00:47:39,319
constrain the definition of explicit
above on implicit memory

1062
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:43,769
to those cases where the event was
consciously perceived at the time it

1063
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:44,400
occurred

1064
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,440
and then subsequently lost the explicit
memory

1065
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,019
but preserved in implicit memory

1066
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:52,769
by all accounts

1067
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:56,109
anaesthetized patients added adequately
anaesthetized patients are not aware of

1068
00:47:56,109 --> 00:48:00,420
what's going on at the time of at the
time the event occurred

1069
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,129
are because there's no conscious
perception involved

1070
00:48:03,129 --> 00:48:07,000
i really think that what we've got in
anesthesia is case

1071
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,439
uh... ball

1072
00:48:08,439 --> 00:48:09,950
of the implicit perception

1073
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,400
but in any event

1074
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,070
it appears to be the case that at least
under some circumstances

1075
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:16,849
in anesthesia

1076
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:20,379
something can percolate through
something can get through

1077
00:48:20,379 --> 00:48:24,299
on it's not enough to give rise to
conscious recollection it's not enough

1078
00:48:24,299 --> 00:48:27,979
to give rise to any kind of conscious
experience of all

1079
00:48:27,979 --> 00:48:31,719
bubbly conceived by subjects responses
to these priming tests

1080
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:34,809
that's something did

1081
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:37,859
did in fact get through

1082
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:38,440
alm

1083
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,599
which leaves

1084
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,959
the question called

1085
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:44,919
maybe subjects are aware of everything
that's going on

1086
00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:46,369
during surgery

1087
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:49,259
and they're just bay just don't remember
it later on

1088
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,970
this is a very common uh...

1089
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:57,130
the question about its reminds me of the
harlan ellison

1090
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,569
where it might actually be the case

1091
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:02,719
that the events of that anaesthetized
patients are aware of what's going on

1092
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,569
during surgery

1093
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:07,929
but unable to respond by virtue of the
muscle relaxant

1094
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:09,460
and what they experiences

1095
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,239
a kind of

1096
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,249
amnesia

1097
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,380
for something that they were conscious
of

1098
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,089
it turns out that's not the case

1099
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:19,220
okay patients are not aware

1100
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,659
during anesthesia

1101
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:22,119
called we know that

1102
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:24,810
alva through on some very interesting
experiments

1103
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:28,719
that actually allow patients to respond
voluntarily

1104
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,449
if they could if they would think that
they heard of the stimulus

1105
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:35,499
why all their all boulder anesthetized

1106
00:49:35,499 --> 00:49:36,719
i can do this i think

1107
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:37,939
pretty quickly

1108
00:49:37,939 --> 00:49:41,469
the isolated look at what's known as the
iceland fore arm technique

1109
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:43,229
where the arm

1110
00:49:43,229 --> 00:49:44,139
the uh...

1111
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:49,059
the a muscle relaxant spine two
receptors really really really fast

1112
00:49:49,059 --> 00:49:50,970
so if you put a blood pressure cough

1113
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:53,660
on patients are

1114
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,300
while the muscle relaxant or being
delivered

1115
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,909
you can actually

1116
00:49:57,909 --> 00:49:58,649
faulty eliminate

1117
00:49:58,649 --> 00:50:01,439
the paralysis

1118
00:50:01,439 --> 00:50:05,799
so that you can then ask the patient if
you can hear me squeeze my hand

1119
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:07,160
right cassia connection

1120
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,499
make the response in the storm to
doesn't have the most we'll accept it

1121
00:50:11,499 --> 00:50:12,309
ald

1122
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:16,639
and here's a very nice study are here

1123
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,349
early on in the procedure bata
hundred-percent to patients respond

1124
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:23,990
just one or two minutes after the
delivery of anesthesia there's no

1125
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,619
responsible to the patient these
patients are not aware

1126
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:30,889
during the procedure

1127
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:33,769
nevertheless despite their lack of
awareness

1128
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:35,339
somethings can percolate thru

1129
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:37,349
to give rise to priming effects

1130
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:41,749
uh... in the recovery room

1131
00:50:41,749 --> 00:50:45,810
okay that's controlled call mark on
surgical anesthesia

1132
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:50,180
on wednesday will look at the
uncontrolled coma of karma and the

1133
