1
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:04,470
ok but see if we can wrap things up
today

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:04,980
are

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,380
just a reminder we got a final exam

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,869
scheduled for tuesday the ten th of a
three to six p m

5
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,749
gymnasium

6
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:16,619
d_s_p_ students

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,270
volume should have heard from me by now
that they sent us

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,769
sent to reach a deal and email

9
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:25,759
along belcher accommodations to puke if
you get an accommodation

10
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:30,570
mall if you haven't heard from the heart
send me an email

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,359
what's going on

12
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:37,260
anyway the examiners formatted as until
exams which you've got three hours

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,680
first hours not cumulative total

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,240
covered material since

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,800
c_e_o_

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,900
since the midterm

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,230
the second hour is to know that they
will cover some material from

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,230
from the midterm

19
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,450
but also give you a chance to put some
things together

20
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,150
on next wednesday here

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,940
a regular class time

22
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,490
will have a q and a session if you've
got any questions at all

23
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,309
or bring them to the

24
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:05,840
flynn of the class

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,900
deal with my won't do any formal review
at that time

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,620
and the reason i won't do that

27
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,260
is that

28
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,470
the ought never to review that's all i
have to say about it

29
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,330
so you can get that kind of there was
some

30
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,880
people questions there

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,979
although previous exams are up and there
is now one newbies face forum dedicated

32
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,960
to the final exam if you've got
questions of the run-up to the final

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,940
on just fill

34
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:40,470
right here let me know

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,490
and again just a reminder than on killer
portions of the cover all the material

36
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,560
since the midterm

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,560
the to an abortion is going to cover

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,500
okay

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,950
last time we talked about the cause of
the hog to a different empirical

40
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,500
definitions of consciousness

41
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,360
that allow us to investigate the
question of

42
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,330
weather

43
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,780
non adults

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,820
nonverbal humans

45
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,249
don humans have something resembling
consciousness hello or not

46
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:13,089
the so-called

47
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:15,279
mirror self recognition test

48
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,719
pioneered by home

49
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,289
pioneered by with gordon gallup

50
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:22,379
and the so-called forcefully expressed

51
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,369
all of them

52
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:26,799
that is very popular developmental
psychology

53
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:30,119
and that you've noticed that there is an
apparent contradiction between the

54
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:31,699
findings of the saudis

55
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:36,579
if you define consciousness in terms of
behaviorally and terms of the ability to

56
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,009
pass of

57
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:40,209
the mirror self recognition test

58
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:43,589
then all normal human infants to this
pretty much all normal human infants to

59
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:45,540
this point needs to

60
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,720
but yet to define consciousness

61
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,230
in terms of the ability to pass the
forcefully stress

62
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,870
that doesn't happen for most kids until
bulb

63
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,049
until about the

64
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:58,769
hard so they resolved there's a gap
there

65
00:02:58,769 --> 00:02:59,969
well what other reasons

66
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:02,279
why there's a gap there is that

67
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:06,349
little kids very little kids are very
verbal they don't have their they don't

68
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:07,030
have

69
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,319
property for the good linguistic skills
yet

70
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,209
and it's been suggested that the
operable nature of the standard false

71
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:15,370
belief task

72
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,540
gets in the way of young children

73
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,049
responding appropriately or the properly
into it

74
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:24,539
so for example clement supporter all but
all of them

75
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:26,979
on his noticed a small early on

76
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,710
putting two and three year-old kids

77
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,139
three of the through the uh...

78
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:31,739
through the forcefully expressed

79
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,899
they'd say that u_s_ ticket to see where
the popped it will work

80
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:39,639
state usually make a mistake they
identify the wrong location

81
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,550
but if you were asked the child to look

82
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,239
where the puppet will work

83
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,769
but the child will often do is to work
in the right place that is what where

84
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,679
the puppet believes called the yelling

85
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,879
georg so that the toys the bed

86
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,899
so it's possible

87
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:59,439
very young infants younger than age four
or five

88
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,110
have some understanding of the theory of
mine

89
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,399
but it's just not an understanding that
can be expressed holiday verbally

90
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:09,410
all for those of you who goes and what
developmental psychology

91
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,599
this is a wall problem developmental
psychology

92
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,130
the distinction between

93
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,199
on the child's competence of the child's
performance

94
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,630
if you work for example lead

95
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,499
so uh... children's song little rustic

96
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:22,680
of behavior

97
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,050
it's very clear that should that little
kids can all understand

98
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,710
a lot more language that they can
produce

99
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,169
because they have linguistic competence
that just doesn't necessarily translate

100
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:36,360
into home

101
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,400
one way to deal with this problem of
course

102
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,240
sister concoct

103
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,219
a non-verbal version called the force
police task

104
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:47,590
and this is what it would be she and
boulder here on

105
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,409
psychologist at the university of
illinois on did

106
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:54,499
all you know study pioneering study
really truly wonderful study

107
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:57,479
on involving fifteen on mon bold infants

108
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,739
all who were put into a totally
nonverbal version

109
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:03,819
called the forcefully fast

110
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:08,370
all of tested which

111
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,539
expectancies were set up

112
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:11,129
all for the children

113
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:11,830
and then

114
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,689
all of these are logs

115
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,329
targets behavior violates those
expectancies

116
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:19,629
as you look at philips yet at the
infants reaction to it

117
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:23,999
and there's a general idea in
developmental psychology let's go no

118
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:25,219
controversial

119
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:26,250
philosophic factions

120
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,660
but there is a general idea which is
that

121
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,110
infants even infants

122
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,080
will pay more attention two events that
violate their expectancies they'll look

123
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,669
at the law burger

124
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,720
so what you could do is you can measure

125
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,520
the amount of time the child looks at
some of them

126
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,479
or not

127
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,359
or two

128
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:47,250
should determine whether it's been
surprised by that or not

129
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,349
taken to the experiment because it is
the thing of beauty

130
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,029
partly because it's such a filter
something also want to do later uh...

131
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:55,399
leader of the lecture

132
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:00,090
the experiment begins with three
so-called the militarization trials

133
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,900
that are simply intended to

134
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,580
well a quake the infant missus these are
fifteen-month old parkinson's or justo

135
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,310
people bid over a year old

136
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,710
wild with this procedure

137
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,499
and what happens on trial one is that
there's this actor here

138
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:18,750
theirs is the old boxes there is a green
box so there's hope

139
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,259
all plastic watermelons whitefield

140
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:22,919
and there's a little stage

141
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,349
and what happens is that the doors on
the stage open kinda blindfolded actor

142
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:28,919
appears

143
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,279
all piled up on the stage

144
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:31,930
itself

145
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,640
well na playful discover

146
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,939
got a you know

147
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:36,430
vice around so you can see

148
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,900
or arise

149
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,650
she picks up

150
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,519
the law of the watermelon

151
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,940
and puts it into the green box

152
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,789
that's all it happens on on trial

153
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:48,250
and what happens then is that there are
two

154
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,969
on uh... or other familiar recession
trials

155
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:55,150
there's a yellow box and every box in
the actor appears

156
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,449
and she wishes

157
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,210
into the green box

158
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,460
and then she goes away

159
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,580
and then she comes back and she reaches
into the quickbooks argument goes away

160
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,970
again that's all the fifteen-month old
debts

161
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,030
five-way ultimately resumption

162
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,489
are with this large

163
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:13,530
with this experimental environment

164
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,420
then there are some trials

165
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,740
that are that would be sheehan violation
on call

166
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,680
all believe production trials there

167
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,620
four different conditions of this
experiment

168
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,199
the whole bunch of fifteen month old

169
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,389
urbana-champaign has a lot of infants

170
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:33,069
and so on they were able to do two types
while relatively large number of kids in

171
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,389
each of these conditions

172
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,460
so let me to disarm very briefly

173
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,370
there we've got the yellow box at the
green box of the actor again

174
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,689
and on and one condition which they call

175
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:45,020
true belief green

176
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,860
all of the all the new york

177
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,809
the actor

178
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:50,039
as by

179
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,029
result folsom strings of police

180
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:53,300
the yellow box

181
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,759
just moves toward reeboks

182
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,300
and then moves away

183
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,970
nothing happens about the location of
the watermelon

184
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,289
all that happens is that there's some
action

185
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:03,669
yellow box moves toward

186
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:04,840
three boxes

187
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,159
obviously a control condition

188
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:10,550
and then there is a real

189
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,760
second condition called true belief
yellow

190
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,800
in which the actor is here

191
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,289
the actor watches

192
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:21,139
as the watermelon again by virtue of
some strings and police moves

193
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:22,529
from the green box

194
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:25,830
into the yellow box

195
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,590
then there it is although doctor
condition known as forcefully grave

196
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,270
where there is no waktu present

197
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,290
at all

198
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,820
for what the infant that's to watch

199
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,180
the watermelon movin

200
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,120
between box

201
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
to began talks

202
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,810
and then there is a poor condition are
very complicated condition known as the

203
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,460
reportedly yellow condition where the
actor is present

204
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,210
as and watches as the watermelon moves
from the green box to the yellow box

205
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,980
then the actor goes away

206
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,319
the doors are closed

207
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:02,130
and by means of the school system

208
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,079
the watermelon slice moves back

209
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:08,710
from the yellow box with remarks but
uh... this is very cool

210
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,350
and uh...

211
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,630
and of obviously all these conditions
were done and thought that was a were

212
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,559
assigned randomly the subjects of all
that kind of stuff in

213
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,749
yes they cover balance the yellow in the
green boxes they did everything they

214
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:20,420
were supposed to do

215
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,810
and the question is

216
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,279
what now happens

217
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,730
on the test trial

218
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,790
the actor appears

219
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:32,370
and either reaches into the green box

220
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,070
yellow box

221
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,700
does the infant respond differently to
this

222
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,660
depending on

223
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,070
what do you know understands

224
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:45,370
the actor notes and uh... and hoa what
the bosnian serb understands about where

225
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,459
the watermelon

226
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,620
called is

227
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,259
obviously

228
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,780
if the actor is all

229
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,900
artful

230
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,740
reaching into a prickly into a
particular box which i was going to be

231
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,930
surprised

232
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,620
and in fact that's exactly what happened

233
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,860
so we're looking at looking times here

234
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,150
and we're looking at the amount of time

235
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,979
all of the the infant looks

236
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:09,300
when the halt when when the actor

237
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,019
reaches into the yellow box

238
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:13,880
where the watermelon

239
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,110
or reaches into the green box where the
actor thinks the watermelon is and here

240
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,699
in the true believe grain

241
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:20,730
when the actor

242
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,990
reaches into the yellow box

243
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,010
the infant surprised by that and spends
a lot of time looking

244
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,250
where the all

245
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,000
when the true belief is that the
watermelon is in the yellow box

246
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,060
the child is surprised

247
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,790
the actor vault gold

248
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,820
inspects

249
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,160
inspects the green box

250
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,999
now when

251
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:41,770
the forcefully the actor as the false
belief

252
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,470
that it soon

253
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,210
the green box

254
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,230
child a surprise when the actor reaches
into the autobots

255
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,259
the child is is that the child to say
epidemic

256
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:54,019
you don't think the watermelons of
yellow box right why are you doing this

257
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:54,690
right

258
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,369
and when

259
00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:57,720
the hard the actor has the false belief

260
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,550
that the home

261
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,339
at the altered watermelons and yellow
box

262
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,610
the child appears to be surprised

263
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,190
when the actor regions of the green box

264
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,250
again these fifteen month old infants

265
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,050
seem to understand

266
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,500
what there is that the actor who knows

267
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,149
and they seem to have the expectation

268
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:22,829
that the actor will behave in accordance
with what he or she knows

269
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:25,010
or believes to be the case

270
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,750
even when that knowledge or belief is
faults

271
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,470
that's the theory of mind

272
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,200
and by the evidence of this sat down
several of the several other studies

273
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,830
have been done since then

274
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,970
or it appears

275
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,699
that mobile home

276
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,299
fifteen-month old kids have it

277
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,749
that's about as early as you can post
these kids though some experiments with

278
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:46,240
eight month old

279
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,920
vishal results

280
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,050
roughly the same collection

281
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,210
both apparent contradiction

282
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,450
between the results of the may result
recognition case

283
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,920
which suggests that

284
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,770
our kids

285
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,910
all i have

286
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,730
something like

287
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,150
all all

288
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,450
part art part over consciousness of self
by the by the time that the lord

289
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,550
community-based

290
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,630
doesn't contradict

291
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,280
all of the performance of the polls with
gus so long as you're giving the child

292
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,780
and honorable version all the polls
we've passed

293
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:21,840
one that doesn't tax his or her on his
or her cognitive

294
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,820
so the general idea here is that even
infants aged fifteen months

295
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,420
not quite fresh out of the wall but

296
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,870
but it's still pretty young

297
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,510
all have these are some some rudimentary
theory of mine

298
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,790
they have some sense of what other
people believe

299
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,790
they have some sense of what other
people believe might be incorrect

300
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,130
or at least at what other people believe
they differ from what they believe

301
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:46,899
and

302
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,290
infants expect other people to blame

303
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,679
the trip to behave

304
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,359
in accordance with their beliefs

305
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:55,019
and when they're surprised when paul

306
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,390
went off dot other people behave
accordance with something that they

307
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,980
don't believe where they're not supposed
to believe

308
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,610
so here you can see

309
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,230
that even relatively young kids fifteen
month old

310
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,290
victims

311
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,210
what we would up now wonder staff

312
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,430
as theory of mine

313
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,630
you can see where we're going with this

314
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:21,040
now that we've got nonverbal test or the
theory of mine

315
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,189
that's something that could be
administered

316
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:25,970
dogs and cats and of course chimpanzees

317
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,319
our closest or

318
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,820
or closely primate of relative

319
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,470
all we know that should pansies pastor
marisol recognition does

320
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,670
on board that that scallops explode
research

321
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,259
and we have a very clear sense that own
she could do that

322
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:42,720
the question is

323
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,420
do chimpanzees had anything remotely
resembling

324
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,020
you're in the body

325
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,870
do they have a sense that

326
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,630
creatures beliefs

327
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,690
that those beliefs might differ from
there's do they have the expectation

328
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,680
that other creature

329
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,400
martin recordings along with the police

330
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,360
are there are

331
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,340
other chimpanzee experiments dealing
with other aspects of the theory of mine

332
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,070
all but i don't

333
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,730
someone spent part of that today let's
just look

334
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,660
part of the question of whether
chimpanzees

335

00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,170
about other peoples

339
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,580

quite a bit

346
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,550
or what happens in these experiments but
sorry i don't have a picture of a thug

347
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,030
looking all over for on

348
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,000
have one once i just can't

an event

350
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,489
follow what happens here

351
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:55,690
is that there is a hotter old a lot of
the human

352
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,970
who's been working with the chimpanzees
add to this august this sort of that

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,800

most brightly colored plastic buckets
all on yup

357
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,199
and at the at the high gear

358
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,340
hikes this treat fruit loops or
something like that

359
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,200
all in full view of another bom

360
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,780
pics for better known as the
communicator

361
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,630
and the communicator has

362
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,059
previously been shown to be

363
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:25,190
all reliable

364
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,740
source all the information about where
treats and food and other things art the

365
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,939
way the slope

366
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:31,950
waited so long

367
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,920
on expert is usually done is that the
communique will come out

368
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,260
to be two buckets

369
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,700
one on either side

370
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,390
and the fighter will point to the one
bucket

371
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,330
or the other bucket

372
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,950
chimpanzee will go

373
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,210
turn over the bucket and fight between
headed that way

374
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:48,530
previously

375
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,620
the communicator has been shown to be a
reliable source of inspiration

376
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,360
as to where

377
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,710
the treats or

378
00:15:54,710 --> 00:16:01,240
so the higher hides a reward view of the
communicator

379
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,780
and them palm

380
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,879
the communicator

381
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,190
all leaves the room

382
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,810
and then the hiker comes back

383
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,449
and switches the pockets

384
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:09,850
case which is the reward

385
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,580
from one pocket farther to the other

386
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,540
full on

387
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,210
in full view orbited of the subject

388
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,330
and the communicator that comes back
into the room

389
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,149
and points

390
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:22,230
took one of the two

391
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,360
in fact if unit leader does

392
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,220
is to work

393
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,840
the all the box

394
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,260
as the correct bucket

395
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,500
the place where

396
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,190
the where the where the troops going to
be found

397
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,100
communicator things

398
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,060
the tree his over here

399
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,120
the chimpanzee

400
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,840
that the trees but moved

401
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,599
the other

402
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:45,780
all of the the other container

403
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,209
and the question is which box

404
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:50,430
was the chimpanzee shoot

405
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,770
does the chimpanzee have the idea that

406
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,600
but communicator

407
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,660
he treated someplace

408
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,220
the chimpanzee knows

409
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,259
but the treaties

410
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:02,900
someplace on someplace else

411
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,459
make a long story short

412
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,829
what calling thomas l a good was to test

413
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,530
four and five year old children

414
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,549
on this task

415
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:12,649
and it turned out

416
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:14,470
that typical four-year-old

417
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,100
didn't pass the theory of what that this
nonverbal theory of mine

418
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,470
all of the past

419
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,650
all but the typical five-year-old did
that's in line with the original results

420
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,180
we talked about

421
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,340
so at least by the standards of the five
year olds

422
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,440
they can kind of get this house

423
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,090
question is

424
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,570
what are the apes do

425
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,340
deviates

426
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,230
fail this

427
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,630
miserably

428
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,480
day they don't have though that they
don't have some sense

429
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,190
that the home that the communicator by
pure warned that the

430
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,300
communicators believes

431
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,769
by people's they don't seem to have

432
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,370
the same kind of theory of mine

433
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,290
five-year-old

434
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,659
that his five-year-old infants

435
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:03,370
now were recently there has been who's
been on this could calling thomas solo

436
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,480
studies stimulated a lot of interest to
work

437
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,600
part of a number of installed of
investigators at all

438
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,110
at no time spent a lot of time looking
at various aspects of primate cognition

439
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,340
especially alot especially chimpanzee
cognition

440
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,150
permanent his colleagues following up on
the colin thomas ella studies

441
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,180
or developed

442
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,940
what's known as the primate cognition
test battery it's like an i_q_ test for

443
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,200
checked baggage

444
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,330
got a whole bunch of subclass on at
looking at

445
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,060
you know that chimpanzees ability to
deal with physical objects

446
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:41,280
i want to deal with quantities relative
walk were relatively

447
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,450
on through all of them

448
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:48,210
who will be differences about causality
on and also or the toast of various

449
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,650
social skills

450
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,740
whether rome

451
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,190
logy pansies

452
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,940
or other project learn

453
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,780
by observing each other

454
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,650
all how good they are at

455
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,540
rather than communication

456
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,309
finally

457
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:04,380
permanent his colleagues employed me
home

458
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,510
or two-thirds of the theory of mine

459
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,399
the animals can in fact

460
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,760
follow somebody else's gays sola fide
point to something

461
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,620
out there

462
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,620
in the presence of a chimpanzee

463
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,020
if i do that to you

464
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,340
so for the fact that there would be
slight or look over there

465
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,740
you're going to turn your eyes

466
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,620
and follow

467
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,160
all the love of apollo by david because
you cannot i'm looking at something

468
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,710
and you want to see what i see okay

469
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,370
and you turn your gays in the direction
of mine or that or or or the direction

470
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,590
by pointing

471
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,979
because you have some sense

472
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:39,039
that if you look we're all i'm looking

473
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,260
you'll see what on c

474
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,059
that's the whole point

475
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,050
days following

476
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,380
and then there was alot of but were less
than truthful

477
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,040
moralist and ripples leave

478
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,730
why does show you this because i think
huge study

479
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,690
they press the board or a hundred
chimpanzees

480
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,710
it s a whole bunch of a rang at times
and of course they put a bunch of cuban

481
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,350
children through these tasks is exactly
the same tasks

482
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,860
kids who were pretty on

483
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,999
on average age

484
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,170
of two-and-a-half years old

485
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,810
skipping

486
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,060
lightly through most of the uh...

487
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,240
real results of this

488
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,870
the apes were asked to deal with special
problems

489
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:26,039
they did pretty well not quite as well
as the kids but they did pretty well

490
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,200
when they were asked to deal with
questions of quantity

491
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,940
all of the chance of your ranks again
did relatively well

492
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,690
are when they were even asked to make of
the causal inferences

493
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,990
or do you know nate seemed to do or
relatively shipment is horrendous acts

494
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,650
are pretty smart

495
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,330
in the laboratory

496
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,010
when they were appalled when they were
asked to learn from each other engage in

497
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,879
some social learning past their children
did this very reveille

498
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,190
but neither the chimpanzees

499
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,440
the all

500
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,580
nor the iran depends on did

501
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,610
kidded somewhat better on tasks are
involving over

502
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:05,890
communication

503
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,320
uh... we see each other

504
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,280
but again when we get to the critical
theory of mine passed

505
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,100
these children your average age
two-and-a-half years old years of age

506
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,090
manage to parents

507
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,880
alone yarn

508
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,640
nonverbal theory of mine passed

509
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,059
all but the chimpanzees

510
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:24,289
the around that time

511
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:26,060
mostly did

512
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,950
these three by mta zero into possible
answers

513
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,559
so you'd expect fifty percent by chance

514
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,460
and they're performing basically

515
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,940
so again based on this kind of

516
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,309
very systematic comparison

517
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:41,600
between the park

518
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,430
between barbara chimpanzees ragtime

519
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,960
very young children

520
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,489
chimpanzees

521
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:51,930
do pretty well as long as they're doing
with non social kinds of things

522
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,590
but as soon as you get into all of the
social aspects of cognition

523
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,650
especially when you get to the theory of
mine

524
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:03,900
or the chimpanzees and moran seemed to

525
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,240
pretty poorly

526
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,760
on here again this is just a little of
the breakdown of those three of my best

527
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,290
or they're not very good at following
the kiddies

528
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,960
over the experimenter

529
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,900
on and they're not

530
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,299
very good about it before

531
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:19,910
experiment

532
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,760
volumes

533
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,190
as the children

534
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,809
now there are some problems with all
these studies and it's important before

535
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:29,150
we go much further

536
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,600
that we kind of talk about the vocal

537
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,780
for a second

538
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,470
our first there were a bunch of on
public on phones here

539
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,799
on makes a difference it turns out

540
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,669
whether on the animals are tested these
are usually young of a fairly or gavel

541
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:46,720
makes a difference of the weather's
animals were kids

542
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,510
or whether they're tested with their
parents aware that the touch the below

543
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,440
system social context

544
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,149
pyramid

545
00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:00,799
probably the most critical one i think
the bulls so no problem with all of

546
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,430
these or the chimpanzee theory of mind
on studies

547
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,130
is it it makes a difference

548
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,520
who the experimenter it

549
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,269
when the subject is or human

550
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:11,659
infant

551
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:12,890
or a child

552
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:18,130
the experimental there's another human
being

553
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,040
but when the subject as a chimpanzee

554
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,830
the experimenter is

555
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,350
not another chimpanzee

556
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,590
but another human being

557
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:32,020
so it kind of asking a chimpanzee to do
something that you're not asking the

558
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,929
children to do

559
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:37,640
you're asking the inference to reason
about what's going on in a con specifics

560
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,330
head

561
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:39,940
reasonable what they are

562
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,509
big brothers and sisters or their
parents at all

563
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:43,940
are trying to think about

564
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,160
but in these tests

565
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,710
were always asking

566
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:53,080
chimpanzees to reason about what's going
on in and other species

567
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,650
and that's different task entirely

568
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,040
uh... what you'd really like to do

569
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,860
is that train up a chimpanzee research
assistant

570
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,910
also that you could get a chimpanzee the
v_ the indicators

571
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,759
reliable reliably pointing

572
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:12,770
at one forty four of the or the or the
other and then see what happens

573
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,270
to my knowledge no bodies dot

574
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,330
but if any of you ever get into a
position where you've got a hundred and

575
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,040
sixteen pansies and contest

576
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,950
really encourage her to think about this

577
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,300
of moreover

578
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,300
frogs the wall and other all that and
other investigators who look at your

579
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,050
pansies in the wild have found plenty of
evidence for social learning

580
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,010
all oblong chimpanzee

581
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,179
on chimpanzees are

582
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:41,120
very good at warning from other
chimpanzees

583
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,350
provided that this morning takes place

584
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,320
wondered naturalistic conditions in the
wild

585
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,750
if they're not so good about so-called
learning from each other in the yard

586
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,059
in the laboratory

587
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:54,800
that may be a problem with the
laboratory projects

588
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,100
so again

589
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,890
context seems to matter here

590
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,409
and wall his organs

591
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:02,320
but you get plenty of evidence

592
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,530
intelligence and consciousness and
chimpanzees

593
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:09,890
so long as you look at their behavior on
the more or less natural

594
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,750
it may very well be

595
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,149
that chimpanzees veranda tags

596
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:16,580
have a theory of the chimpanzee mine

597
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,930
or the or or the around it and mine

598
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,670
it something else and firewood

599
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,050
to ask them that they have

600
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,560
of theory all blown

601
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,560
of the eight mark

602
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,029
seven this at all

603
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:30,700
of the bps

604
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,850
critical part of the father of the
comments aside

605
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,880
calling thomas l have remarkably that
you know

606
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,080
their chimpanzees don't password

607
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,309
the old

608
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,910
the various versions nonverbal

609
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,330
the forcefully expressed

610
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,290
shut there is a lot going on inside the
head of a chimpanzee

611
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:55,460
on chimpanzee cognition go way beyond
simple stimulus response were

612
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,980
goes way beyond

613
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:02,350
bindle kind of repetitive mindless
acquisition hopeful of various gender

614
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,190
roles

615
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,550
and they suggested that

616
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,660
in fact there is a psychology the
chimpanzees have

617
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,040
it's just not quite the same psychology
we've got

618
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,800
they suggested that

619
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,470
junction packages have papers what they
call a perception goal

620
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,279
all psychology

621
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,780
chimpanzees have the ability

622
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,779
to wonder stand orders

623
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:24,360
including other species

624
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,720
knowledge and beliefs or they have some
sense for example mister

625
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,310
or that their traders concede things of
bill clinton's about that

626
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,800
that they don't

627
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,110
and also chimpanzees have some although
some of the lease wonders there

628
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,690
other people's goals

629
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,930
and intentions

630
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,999
when the when they are with a keeper
comes then around on the hood

631
00:26:44,999 --> 00:26:46,030
around food time

632
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,570
the apple start asking for food stuff

633
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,480
pointing towards habitat for the food is
kept of all that kind

634
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,070
add seem to have some sense

635
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,840
of what the art of what the

636
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,410
t principles do

637
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,550
what callin thomas l o

638
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,120
or argue chimpanzees don't have

639
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,930
is what we typically mean by kanda bug
bite by consciousness

640
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,299
but no which is

641
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:09,280
that they work

642
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:09,930
what he called

643
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,640
they call believed

644
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,350
desire psychology

645
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,400
that is they seem to be unable to
appreciate

646
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,730
therefore there are people have beliefs
about the world

647
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,900
that may differ

648
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,290
from bearers

649
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,290
and they seem not to have the ability to
appreciate

650
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,600
people's beliefs

651
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,760
determine what their behaviors satellite
that could be like

652
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,680
even when their beliefs are wrong

653
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,600
this is the companies are the kinds of
believes buttercup

654
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,970
by the so-called forcefully expressed

655
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,700
either and it's verbal

656
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,940
boards nonverbal manifestations

657
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,880
chimpanzees just don't seem to get

658
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,430
don't seem to get that for

659
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,809
so it's not the case

660
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:50,100
the chimpanzees

661
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,320
dot akansh

662
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,650
it's not the case that jim clancy's
don't have alone

663
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,080
don't have that kind of psychology

664
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,490
it's just not arts it's about the same
as lord

665
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,880
forms with dot

666
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,510
sort of info

667
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,780
so let's try to review the bidding here
for a second

668
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,920
we're going to define consciousness in
terms of having a theory of the mind

669
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,109
the idea that

670
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:20,980
or mental states represent objects that
her independent of themselves

671
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,640
at other people may have mental
representations of the world that differ

672
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,049
from ors

673
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:30,429
and that people are expected to be paid
in accordance with bare all

674
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:34,110
mental representations of the world

675
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,470
intention ality

676
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,960
the love that that it's pretty clear

677
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,770
but we've got a people in this room
we've all got it with old humans have it

678
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,510
turns out the children have a true even
very young children

679
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,029
or fifteen months old

680
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:54,120
or with the press their belief desire
psychology they seem

681
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,910
they seem to have it

682
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,920
or at least they have the beginnings of
a as manifested like young issued

683
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,309
dollars joon

684
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:06,370
although i don't have time to talk about
this talk about this more the social

685
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,120
cognition class for those of you who

686
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,700
stayed around long enough to take a
former offer a tax

687
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,260
there's also the doors quite a bit of
evidence around now that i love the

688
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,100
classically autistic children

689
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,150
all of the do very poorly on

690
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,300
or both verbal and honorable

691
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,570
all versions of the theory of mind

692
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,780
which suggests

693
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,490
that there's some kind of limitation

694
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,330
consciousness their but certainly for on
chimpanzees around the kinds of other

695
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,540
off of others of our primate relatives

696
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,560
they just don't seem to have it at all

697
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,320
part of these

698
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,340
as for as we could go so we've got a

699
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,280
human infants have

700
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,630
uh... it's don't seem to have it all

701
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,960
now let's turn

702
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,000
but very briefly

703
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,720
for the last question

704
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,250
have we always have it

705
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,309
when you think about

706
00:29:58,309 --> 00:29:58,970
consciousness

707
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,840
or any other

708
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,579
human

709
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:03,450
mental characteristic

710
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,190
from a fight with all of the home from a
file a genetic

711
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,520
the figure well

712
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,930
some species have it

713
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,190
we don't have it

714
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,960
ordered ordered all the other species do
have a

715
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,570
we've got it we've always had it

716
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,259
if you think about the development of
salt

717
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:21,490
mental trade my consciousness from it

718
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,429
auto genetic

719
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:27,179
you said well you know we call them
become one of the wall that we might

720
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:28,820
have it then but we

721
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,710
you'd get it pretty quickly by fifteen
months of two years of three years

722
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,730
alike and we just kind of keep it

723
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,280
from our cultural point of view however

724
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,180
from a historical point of view

725
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,290
it seems reasonable or at least

726
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,720
provocative

727
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,340
whether human beings as a species

728
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,660
have always been conscious

729
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,289
in the way that we

730
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:54,990
today in or

731
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,350
society and culture

732
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,679
have been conscious

733
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,550
and the reasons for thinking that this
isn't a completely stupid question

734
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,919
this is a question about

735
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:08,429
but historical on or or or the cultural
development

736
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:10,850
of of the whole of consciousness

737
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,710
all and the question of whether

738
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,630
somehow

739
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,090
human consciousness

740
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:18,290
which seems to be unique to us

741
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,880
is something that develop

742
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,480
in the human species

743
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,880
not just as a product of evolution

744
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,240
but rather

745
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,909
forwarding cultural history

746
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:29,010
of our species

747
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:32,100
guy don't try to answer this question

748
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,460
all was well of of the princeton
psychologist named julian james his now

749
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,090
deceased

750
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:41,570
also wrote in nineteen seventy six and
cst railway provocative book

751
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:46,419
all which i recommend to all of you for
your summer reading this is really

752
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:48,900
beach reading money combined

753
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,799
the origins of consciousness in the
breakdown of the bicameral mine

754
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:56,320
uh... and i did it in this book

755
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,740
while james tries to make the case

756
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,710
human consciousness is not just and

757
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,830
pro byproduct of our own of our
revolution

758
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,490
something that came with us what we
became humans as a species

759
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:16,520
but rather the human consciousness that
is our cultural achievement

760
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,059
and that there was a point

761
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:23,060
in historical time where we didn't have
the same human consciousness

762
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,940
that we have kit

763
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,790
and james follow the rights very
movingly about law about the source of

764
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:32,059
this it's like he was sitting in one day
we homer's iliad

765
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:35,809
he was really a bit in greek

766
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:36,340
avijit

767
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,850
i did in the product of a classical
education and they're all such a lot on

768
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,429
him

769
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:43,549
then hollywood's iliad

770
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:46,809
nobody

771
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:49,700
nobody makes decisions

772
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,330
nobody interest faxed nobody looks into
his minded but don't try to figure out

773
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,830
what he's feeling

774
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,330
nobody talks about the past there's just
no

775
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,669
no i'm not all that interior mental life

776
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:04,210
in the characters all of the iliad

777
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:07,489
that we expect all of these days to find

778
00:33:07,489 --> 00:33:10,250
ought in anything that anybody rights

779
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,210
rather what happens in the iliad

780
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:17,740
is a god's helm and what to do and them
and go out to do it

781
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,399
the only people who think immediately

782
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,790
so james argues

783
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,700
fall apart

784
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,760
that their gods

785
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,210
all but uh... love your morals just
don't do it at all

786
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,890
james his argument is

787
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,599
this very clear

788
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:35,770
from from the literary structure of the
iliad

789
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,920
and he argues that this is not merely a
poetic device

790
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,190
by the rather

791
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,590
that the way things goal

792
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,070
mentally

793
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,910
don't go mentally immediately

794
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,730
is kind of characteristic of

795
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,879
what we were wiped out a particular
point in our historical

796
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:56,820
and cultural evolution

797
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,100
and this is kind of a evident from the
very first lines all quality

798
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,200
i'll be away

799
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,850
hog here we have a good adopting all
support the translation of his love rage

800
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:07,510
products

801
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,399
saying the rage of pelli assad achilles

802
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,970
and blah blah blah blah blah blah

803
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:15,649
and the will of the worst was moving
towards its and

804
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:20,859
the whole propel portly it begins with
the will of the woods

805
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:21,780
our handout

806
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,530
and the other gods begin news when the
two nd first broken clashed our demand

807
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,219
on board of men and the brilliant
achilles

808
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,620
and the aliya picks up

809
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,559
or midway through the trojan war on it's
been going on for taking pictures

810
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:40,449
and dot and then some of the uh... and
that goes on to the to retail

811
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:43,109
various incidents of the uh... in the
trojan war

812
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:46,919
but what's interesting about them is
that when you look at those those

813
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:47,739
incidents

814
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:51,699
they don't send to stem from people's
desire

815
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,809
they don't uh... what goes on in the
elite does nothing to do with what

816
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:59,440
people believe what they wont or even or
even what they feel

817
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,190
think about the start of the trojan war
where parents kidnaps helen widest paris

818
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,160
kidnap helen

819
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,069
well course helen is the most beautiful
woman in the world the face the wards of

820
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:10,919
march two thousand shift

821
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:14,849
paris doesn't want

822
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:19,809
cially goddesses came to paris and said
which one of us is the most beautiful

823
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:23,619
and after a died he says if you say i
love the most beautiful person a little

824
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:27,939
although although you have a good barry
helen

825
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:31,180
the comparison all okay

826

she is married a man always right that's
why the trojan war starts okay

829
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,899
paris doesn't know what to do about hell
is this guy is a very shepherd living on

830
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:47,269
the hills all doesn't had any idea
what's going on

831
00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:49,319
funds all grilled patrolling

832
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:52,599
on pandemic occurring

833
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,559
let later on in the trojan war

834
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,059
there's a door between mandalay else
who's

835
00:35:58,059 --> 00:35:58,580
husband

836
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,679
and paris who was helen's kidnapper

837
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:05,870
just about the metal as his throttling
paris

838
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:10,039
and just about the time middle ace is
about to kill paris what happens

839
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,940
one of god's comes down

840
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,919
text paris hoping dump some back behind
the walls of choice

841
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:18,819
so they've got to do when the stock

842
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:23,400
is logon standing on the walls of troy
looking down on the thousand ships of

843
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,340
the tens of thousands of men

844
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,719
and she feels and

845
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,549
absolutely no responsibility for what's
but what what what what's been going on

846
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:34,300
the move gee that's really pple

847
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,859
this is really something

848
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:41,349
although antibodies later chiles would
run kills factor because the sort of

849
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:42,440
king pre-order

850
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,910
and preempt comes out of the asks off of
that families for for actors bodies look

851
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,690
at the above the burial

852
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,759

854
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,579
mario

855
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,229
my friend and achilles

856

00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:00,240
hector is body to preempt

858
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,769
but not because he feels any kind of
sympathy for prayer

859
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:10,719
i tell his mother wrote pearson occurs
through agreements has given party

860
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:14,089
parts or did you think that will turn on
they're not loaded just kind of goes off

861
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:14,780
and

862
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,759
doesn't he doesn't

863
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:17,499
think about anything

864
00:37:17,499 --> 00:37:21,479
nobody in the iliad

865
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:25,699
there's a judge in a paris there's
another one

866
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:29,479
depart james points out that all of the
whole language of the iliad which seems

867
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:33,369
at first glance to be suffused with
mentalist construct

868
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:36,139
doesn't really have the middle slightly

869
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:38,339
doesn't mean solar mind of the iliad

870
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,979
it means something close to the breath
or or blood

871
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:44,720
toward most which would not only visa
motion

872
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,189
doesn't mean emotion in the alluded
means motion

873
00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:49,999
volvo

874
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:53,959
although the the the distinction between
buying the body doesn't seem to exist

875
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:57,400
uh... in the yard deal with it

876
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,279
or contrast that

877
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,189
the odyssey

878
00:38:01,189 --> 00:38:05,359
the story although justice is returned
to ethical and his wife

879
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,459
developing

880
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:10,090
again here's how it began saying to me
if a man news

881
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,919
dumb and up twists and turns

882
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:16,569
many cities of men who fought and
learned their minds

883
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:17,799
odysseus is

884
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:19,139
always

885
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:21,669
he's always trying to figure stuff out

886
00:38:21,669 --> 00:38:25,070
he's always plotting he's always
tricking people

887
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:29,149
he's always trying to figure out what's
going on in somebody else's life

888
00:38:29,149 --> 00:38:31,180
he's with the calypso when the silence

889
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,929
right what is what what what what is a
disgusting

890
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:35,479
he has his men

891
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,849
taught him

892
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:40,069
the mast so he can hear the sirens call

893
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:43,679
but he feels his meds here's with work
so they won't

894
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:46,700
he has some sense

895
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,830
if they hear what he hears

896
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,959
that they'll do what he wants to do

897
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:54,839
he has some sense of what he'll want to
do with the sirens call so we have some

898
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,079
self tied to the ship's mast

899
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:01,210
thinking ahead he's planning he's a
badge name what's going to go on

900
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,509
on max

901
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:07,619
alderdice aerosol go out with a truck by
this like lots of policy-wise

902
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,469
argued with the people lines for cyclops

903
00:39:10,469 --> 00:39:13,410
that so that the cyclops won't be able
to see him

904
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,449
on cycle of the policy was asks song

905
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:20,420
uh... what this is his name and he says
i have no body

906
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,999
imo

907
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:23,009
uh... united greek

908
00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:24,360
then bulb

909
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,869
part of it as i would look a little
justices has his men escape

910
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,240
holding on to the bottoms

911
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,859
bellies are both or polity position so
that went on with the mist

912
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:39,440
tries to see if the better writing
although the sheep out of the cape

913
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,079
he won't dog

914
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,099
odd people dog all of them

915
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:44,180
the discover them

916
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:49,130
and then when they get out there kind of
justice has been a right to skate

917
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,450
apology was calls to insult cyclops
friends

918
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,839

welcome nobody is hurting him sober dot

921
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:04,390
going to come to your rescue right

922
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,789
that's what goes on all the way through
the odyssey

923
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:10,809
home ought to do you think he's always

924
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,159
conscious of the way you were conscious

925
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:17,519
he's thinking he's thinking about what
other people are thinking he's trying to

926
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,010
plan arquivo around that

927
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,259
nothing like that happens in the phone

928
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:24,660
immediately

929
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:29,249
kalin there's not if you read the story
of jason the oregon dot so did you get

930
00:40:29,249 --> 00:40:29,890
jason

931
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,909
very much like a business is somebody
who's thinking for himself

932
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:38,329
jason sat silent wary wants his eyes
fixed on the ground beef or is he

933
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:42,369
at a loss as to what to do with his
wretched situation

934
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:45,960
strong for a long time he turned over
and over what issues

935
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,800
thinking and await that

936
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,839
that uh...

937
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,579
the uh... than the characters in the
iliad

938
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,570
while you can see this in the hebrew
bible

939
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,919
the the said said the same distinction

940
00:40:57,919 --> 00:41:00,390
the provoked a story about a minivan

941
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,859
the expulsion from the garden of eden

942
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:06,540
have been able to plop down the garden
of eden and god says

943
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,390
though eat the tree of the fruit of the
heart of the though the fruit of the

944
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,019
tree of knowledge of good we will miss
her okay

945
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:15,690
than the supper comes along and says to
you

946
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,629
etc might have the sample

947
00:41:17,629 --> 00:41:18,660
okay

948
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,550
and so she hates the apple and then she
gives up a bit to uh... to uh...

949
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:28,209
they're going to welcome back to the
sentences to describe the okay

950
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:29,710
automatons that just

951
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:33,270
responding to whatever the last thing
was that happened to them

952
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,030
until they eat from that

953
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,569
the fruit of the tree of knowledge of
god evil

954
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:39,300
then there are teas are open

955
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,890
and there should be as gods they knew
that they were naked they had self

956
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:47,499
recognition that the ferry make about
never thought of that before

957
00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:49,939
on but the birth they got consciousness

958
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:53,459
head up at that point it was a time in
the garden when they were conscious

959
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:55,679
and there's a time at the garden

960
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,549
they were conscious

961
00:41:57,549 --> 00:42:01,729
look at some of the hebrew prophets this
is from the book of a mississippi of the

962
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:03,579
book of the starts

963
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:06,309
famous is a profit

964
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:09,710
what they've been critical of of the you
know

965
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,260
uh... opinion

966
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,539
israel right

967
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:14,440
he doesn't speak for himself

968
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,829
here all who care always rule but with
all of the what the lord says the lord

969
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,060
warrants from his lion

970
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,389
and orders invoices were beautiful

971
00:42:23,389 --> 00:42:26,390
but says the lord and then it goes on
and on and on and on

972
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,310
and then the next at the next verses
boss says the lord that i got up

973
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,889
answers and walked in here

974
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:33,410
amos has just come out

975
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,079
piece for a full bore

976
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,090
docent

977
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,299
doesn't seem to have ideas

978
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:40,039
of his own

979
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:44,119
quite different from what you see in the
book of a clean csd is also part of the

980
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:46,469
orbiaz orbited revival

981
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:49,710
by the preacher had been came over
israel in jerusalem

982
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:54,540
and i applauded my mind to seek and the
search out by wisdom all that is going

983
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,769
on her heaven

984
00:42:55,769 --> 00:43:01,079
and i said to myself i've acquired great
wisdom surprising or whatever

985
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,639
all all the world for two rooms for so
wonderful

986
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:07,949
the the right over clearview wesleyan

987
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:09,829
in a way that the writer

988
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:11,499
the book of business

989
00:43:11,499 --> 00:43:15,469
on fiscal just doesn't seem to be

990
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:18,109
always what what what changes argued

991
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:19,579
go back here for a second

992
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:24,459
what changes argues that early creatures
were essentially creatures of

993
00:43:24,459 --> 00:43:26,920
they were descends

994
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,299
automatons basically responding whatever
was going on

995
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:33,579
om on dot around them

996
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:35,299
all quality

997
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:36,989
whatever thoughts they had

998
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:41,559
were interpreted as instructions from
the gods

999
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:45,279
early early humans according to james

1000
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:49,119
they just been realized that their
thoughts were their own

1001
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,679
they thought that those thoughts

1002
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:55,139
were essentially coming from the gods
who were actually on

1003
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:57,479
actually controlling

1004
00:43:57,479 --> 00:44:02,109
james dates the origin of consciousness

1005
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:06,420
roughly third century he's on the
millennium bc

1006
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,260
fault that the beginnings of it

1007
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,820
as human beings

1008
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,780
shifted from their or the perform their
original hunter gathering mode

1009
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,309
on into our agriculture and large cities

1010
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:21,150
and what happened over what happened
then according to james

1011
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,439
as soon as you begin to develop
civilization

1012
00:44:24,439 --> 00:44:25,490
fabric all true

1013
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,180
city life and so on

1014
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,820
or what you need all

1015
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:32,659
is all in some way of controlling these
large groups of people

1016
00:44:32,659 --> 00:44:34,909
and at some point that at some point

1017
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,999
or what happened was that

1018
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:38,790
came to be constructed this kind of

1019
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:42,249
are fairly rigid social hierarchy or
where

1020
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:43,599
thank god

1021
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,119
speaks to the tape

1022
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,950
the king does when he's told

1023
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,310
and the kings speaks of the people under
him

1024
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,469
and date

1025
00:44:50,469 --> 00:44:51,619
what they're told

1026
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:53,419
white concept comes from the tape

1027
00:44:53,419 --> 00:44:55,579
who was told to do what he does

1028
00:44:55,579 --> 00:44:58,420
called by god again

1029
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,190
order following that goes

1030
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,579
uh... goes from the top down

1031
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:04,890
on you can see this again in the hebrew
bible

1032
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,349
think about moses

1033
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:08,959
on rather than on mount sinai

1034
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:12,539
bozo sees all those horrible stuff going
on with the along with the with the

1035
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:13,100
israel lights

1036
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,130
but most as doesn't come down and say
hey you guys

1037
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,890
i think that we shall not buying
neighbor not kill and don't covet your

1038
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:24,039
wife of your neighbor's wife and all the
stuff

1039
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:27,079
gets the ten commandments from god

1040
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:30,890
all deep this was a blow sis's idea

1041
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:35,209
there was something that was given him

1042
00:45:35,209 --> 00:45:36,519
what happens then

1043
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:41,959
the beginning roughly in the first
millennium bc somewhere around on it

1044
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:42,530
around there

1045
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:47,700
you've got lots of people together
hearing lots of different voices lots of

1046
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,779
disagreement about these voices and what
happens is

1047
00:45:50,779 --> 00:45:56,829
all of the band of the heart of the
begin people human beings

1048
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:57,769
definitely are

1049
00:45:57,769 --> 00:46:01,000
they're actually thinking part for the
other for themselves

1050
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,070
that the gods of no longer telling them
what to do the oracle's begin to

1051
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,469
disappear of or around this time

1052
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:09,719
and the whole thing

1053
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:11,300
is consolidated

1054
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,419
onto watching what was called the golden
age of grace

1055
00:46:14,419 --> 00:46:16,359
around six hundred b_c_

1056
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:23,180
gets solon of with his prescription gold
i sell forget paris tunnel and

1057
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,859
plato and socrates encouraging people
think for themselves

1058
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:29,319
if you go elsewhere

1059
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:30,940
targeted in india and china

1060
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,589
you get the buddha

1061
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:33,420
encouraging people to

1062
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,650
think for themselves and to attribute
their problems to their

1063
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,189
not gods

1064
00:46:39,189 --> 00:46:40,299
and you get

1065
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:41,640
confucius and china

1066
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,689
on both of them celebrating people's
capacity to think for themselves as well

1067
00:46:46,689 --> 00:46:47,619
james's arguing

1068
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:48,759
that there was this

1069
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:50,040
she huge

1070
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,529
cognitive shift

1071
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:52,530
that occurred

1072
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,979
in historical time

1073
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:59,299
from a cognitive stance in which people
experience themselves as more or less

1074
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:01,809
what caught my plans to do in what they
were

1075
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:02,789
holden

1076
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:04,799
operating as creatures of habit

1077
00:47:04,799 --> 00:47:06,480
to point where

1078
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,769
human beings experienced themselves

1079
00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:12,130
for themselves

1080
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,550
and soon as

1081
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:14,969
i'll blog

1082
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:17,429
though that cubans experience themselves

1083
00:47:17,429 --> 00:47:20,169
get view themselves as thinking for
themselves

1084
00:47:20,169 --> 00:47:22,649
that is what james coles

1085
00:47:22,649 --> 00:47:25,159
jan's question origins of consciousness

1086
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:29,479
and he sums us up at a later paper the
swarm of modern beautiful politics

1087
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:33,049
all that is most human about us this
consciousness

1088
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:37,079
this artificial space we have najib and
other people within ourselves

1089
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:40,609
this living within our reminiscences
plans of imagining

1090
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:42,420
all of this is indeed

1091
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,809
only about three thousand years old

1092
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:46,150
told me something

1093
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:48,839
really merchants on the human singing

1094
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:51,029
roughly one thousand

1095
00:47:51,029 --> 00:47:52,739
one thousand nancy

1096
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:56,209
that ladies and gentlemen is less than
one hundred generations

1097
00:47:56,209 --> 00:48:02,380
and from that i think we can conclude
that we are all

1098
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,489
only a hundred generations

1099
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:05,729
james's view

1100
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:07,999
separate us

1101
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:09,519
separate or

1102
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:10,739
consciousness

1103
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:13,989
creatures who work joyce like rust
genetically

1104
00:48:13,989 --> 00:48:16,639
just like us in terms of brain structure

1105
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,009
just like most in terms of having
language

1106
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:20,539
but somehow

1107
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:22,349
appears to have

1108
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:26,969
the same kind of consciousness

1109
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:28,829
james may or may not be right

1110
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:32,359
there's a lot of that there's still a
lot of dispute about this it's kind of a

1111
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:34,459
really

1112
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:37,919
boggles the mind of think that human
consciousness was not something that he

1113
00:48:37,919 --> 00:48:39,109
was always had

1114
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:41,889
but that's the whole point of writing a
provocative book

1115
00:48:41,889 --> 00:48:43,709
want to get people thinking

1116
00:48:43,709 --> 00:48:44,870
one thing we know

1117
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:47,359
is that consciousness is a great gift

1118
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,969
called pollution

1119
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:49,480
we've got

1120
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,789
a level of consciousness that the
weather creature has

1121
00:48:53,789 --> 00:48:56,539
consciousness is a great gift of human
development

1122
00:48:56,539 --> 00:48:59,289
the consciousness of adult humans

1123
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:02,939
for the consciousness all or of human
infants

1124
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:06,569
the changes right consciousness

1125
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,809
and achievement of civilization

1126
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:10,919
it's something

1127
00:49:10,919 --> 00:49:12,579
that we have choir over

1128
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:16,059
the course of cultural time

1129
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:17,790
slumping white an aspect

1130
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:18,569
pop culture

1131
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:20,499
or society

1132
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,679
which means i guess

1133
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:26,479
for all we sell about consciousness that
such arable thing to waste

1134
00:49:26,479 --> 00:49:28,069
ought to go to scotland

1135
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:30,579
and you go visit the castle although i
don't

1136

the airport

1138
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:38,989

1141
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:47,229
bottle up here

1142
00:49:47,229 --> 00:49:50,859
the mindful

1143
00:49:50,859 --> 00:49:52,420
never was there any

1144
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,749
better advice that anybody could give
talk to us

1145
00:49:55,749 --> 00:49:57,809
we've got consciousness

1146
00:49:57,809 --> 00:50:02,489
there was a time when either we didn't
have consciousness or bigger no we have

1147
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:03,589
consciousness

1148
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:05,880
now we have consciousness it's good

1149
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,999
to behave as if we did

1150
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:10,719
so

1151
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:13,019
be mindful
