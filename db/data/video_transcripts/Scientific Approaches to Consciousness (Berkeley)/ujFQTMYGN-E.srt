1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,770
okay what do we begin

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,990
and off

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,510
if there's anybody who was not here last
week in any of the syllabus there are

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,949
somewhat here you can pick them up

5
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:13,519
hector clouds

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,369
cornell

7
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:19,699
or you can download it from the course
website

8
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:21,159
again this week

9
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:25,229
although last week you should have gone
to your discussion section

10
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:28,939
and you should do that again this week
not just because discussions section of

11
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:30,100
the good thing

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,970
but because we might want need to make
sure that we know who's in the class

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,120
we apologize for the are confusions
about

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,100
those phantom discussion sections that's
what happens when you saw for

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,320
staffing cuts through the budget

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,860
fall bob will do our best to get all of
those

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,960
or all of you who registered for one of
those

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,280
phantom sections

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,320
onto the chorus

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,060
we'll do our best with that

21
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,580
okay

22
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,600
problem of consciousness was set

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,840
for fall off the field by rene descartes

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,760
who's trying to figure out what he could
believe what he couldn't believe all and

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,070
he dog discovered that the one thing he
couldn't on dot which was that he was

26
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,820
thinking

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,020
that he was doubting

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,470
and all point i'll make a little bit
later is set for descartes think he was

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,200
just a kind of umbrella term that
covered

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,190
all mental state solve all of all sorts

31
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:32,450
and consciousness was picked up as a
problem for psychology by william james

32
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:38,130
of who wrote in his pioneering solid
introductory psychology of the textbook

33
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,570
that the psychology was the science of
mental life

34
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,770
by which he meant

35
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,350
the science to takes it upon himself to
describe consciousness arms and to uh...

36
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,240
and to explain consciousness

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,659
in the principles of allah james alm
open

38
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:55,399
referred to

39
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,539
the relatively small experimental
literature on dan in psychology that was

40
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:01,860
available to him at the time

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,409
but janusz piano plus a for first time

42
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,259
foremost

43
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:10,060
all apart that dogged looked the best
place to start first look for oprah

44
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,419
scientific psychology

45
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:16,159
was with a technique that floss for
student had made famous for couple

46
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,299
thousand years which was so which was
introspection

47
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:22,700
and he argued that have all the methods
in psychology

48
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,270
introspection is what we have to rely on
first and foremost of all week

49
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,329
james is a wonderful writer

50
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,350
and that when we look into our minds

51
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,549
what we discovered there are states of
consciousness

52
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:39,139
yes echoing day cards as i thought one
thing you cannot doubt

53
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:42,209
you can doubt that those states of
consciousness mean anything

54
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,129
if you want

55
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,120
but you can't doubt that you have

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,220
these of uh...

57
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,590
the use of these states of consciousness

58
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,120
and then james goes on in a famous
chapter of the on on on the stream of

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,229
thought to analyze the characteristics
of consciousness

60
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:00,010
that he finds when he intro specs

61
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,150
when he turns his attention inward and
tries to analyze his own

62
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,379
on them to light

63
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:06,680
here are the five

64
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,389
our characters of consciousness of james
discovered all talk about each of the

65
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,879
briefly arm you know

66
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,139
in a second

67
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:15,629
first of these areas

68
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,580
although it

69
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,910
that consciousness is personal or is
james put it fought tends to personal

70
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,809
forum

71
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:23,189
and he says

72
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:25,309
when you think about

73
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:28,859
what you'll find when you introspective
don't just find thoughts

74
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:33,509
what you'll find our your own thoughts
you don't find somebody else's sports

75
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:37,679
you don't find thoughts that somebody
for a couple years ago or anything like

76
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:38,309
that

77
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:41,099
you find on you find your own thoughts

78
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,419
and then he goes on to our to assert

79
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:46,829
that the universal consciousness act is
not that

80
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,439
gov thoughts and feelings exist

81
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,959
but rather

82
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,259
is thinking or heat is feeling something
that's what james means

83
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:59,659
by thought tending to personal form

84
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:03,569
the second characteristic as i thought
is in constant change

85
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,049
alva

86
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:08,389
the general idea here is that

87
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:10,399
you can have a conscious mental state
because

88
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:11,670
think of something

89
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,799
and end on think of something else and
then think of that first thing again

90
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:17,110
and even that

91
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,220
second thought of the first thing again

92
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,520
is a different for the entirely

93
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,810
not least because

94
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,700
when you think of something the second
time

95
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,170
you're aware of having fought it part of
the first time there's no bottling

96
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,830
sensation or thought no feel we know
desired no nothing

97
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,020
all that you ever have to be exactly

98
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,349
the same way twice

99
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:40,680
is in constant change

100
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,159
and then fought is also sensibly
continuous

101
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,810
palm he argued that we don't just have
little pieces of consciousness to know

102
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,270
that there is a while when we're not
conscious of them all others while when

103
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,800
we're conscious again

104
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,079
but rather and this is what gives him

105
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:58,870
the the metaphor of the stream of
consciousness

106
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,410
called bed that there's a constant flow
of continuous flow of consciousness

107
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,270
yes it's true that consciousness appears
to be interrupted when were asleep

108
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,869
for what we've been hit on the head and
rendered unconscious

109
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:15,979
or when we've been given some kind of
anesthetic agent that renders us on

110
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:16,520
conscious

111
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,980
but when we wake up

112
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,710
james argued

113
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,769
we pick up where we left off

114
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:22,560
in that sense

115
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,860
consciousness is still altman sensibly
continuous

116
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,110
on your don't wake up this at all would
you you know you kind of wonder who i a

117
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,849
m er what i was thinking nor all import
duties are

118
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:35,420
on entirely hold new batch of fought so
i've got

119
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,710
we don't have that kind of experience

120
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,110
when we wake up in the morning

121
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,120
we experience ourselves as the same
person

122
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,050
as we

123
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,789
alone as we experienced when we went to
bed

124
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:49,029
on the night before

125
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:52,589
park here of one of the point that will
pick up on a couple of minutes

126
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:56,559
cuban flawed appears to deal with
objects independent of itself

127
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,209
which is to say

128
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:02,319
fought is always on bumps something you
don't just have a few

129
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,330
right like a cartoon character with are
kinda bubble over your head

130
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,749
called the hog attendees

131
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:11,770
oh or just that is thinking or whatever
and it you're always

132
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,010
the longer always thinking about
something

133
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:20,589
this is what he calls the cognitive
function on the line

134
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,280
the mind knows the things that appear
before it

135
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,150
and it knowles that it knows that

136
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,029
it's physical wearing those all

137
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,610
awareness of perceiving

138
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,700
uh... or or whatever

139
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,090
that's important

140
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,659
one piece of consciousness

141
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:40,029
and then

142
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:41,550
consciousness is always interested in

143
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,310
more in one part of its object

144
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,479
then in another

145
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,770
this is james is all a part of their own

146
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,199
but i think it is interested in the
phenomenon of attention

147
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,619
on the world out there is all good
things he characterized it

148
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:55,260
elsewhere

149
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,730
is a blue mean baatein confusion

150
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,790
until we begin to sort things out

151
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,069
by paying attention to some things

152
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:07,990
or saw aspects of things more that we
pay attention to other kinds of things

153
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,539
accentuate shannan emphasis or present
and every perception we have

154
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:14,599
we look at some things will calm or the
new work of others

155
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:17,729
look at some aspects of those things
more than the book

156
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:23,539
brothers yep

157
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:27,020
this is exactly about selective
attention the fact that i'm not aware of

158
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,080
everything going on in this room right
now i'm looking at you

159
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,150
and paid attention to u_n_ everybody
else kind of fades into the background

160
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,709
that's exactly right

161
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:40,490
ahir james's although the setting the
stage for some people talk about him

162
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,340
three weeks

163
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,379
which is the relationship between
consciousness

164
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,789
and uh... attention

165
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,060
consciousness welcomes and rejects or
chooses

166
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,129
all the while it

167
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:55,110
so that's kind of what

168
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,910
james talked about uncut consciousness
at the most abstract level

169
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,130
the next question is what kinds of
thoughts or their what kinds of mental

170
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,020
states all org are there

171
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,089
all that we find when we

172
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,300
looking into already

173
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,060
all of the most succinctly

174
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,340
answer to this question was actually
given to us not by a psychologist papaya

175
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,740
philosopher immanuel kant or writing in
the critique of judgement towards the

176
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,419
end of the eighteenth century

177
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,229
where cult simply a starts

178
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:26,030
forbearers

179
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,529
three

180
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:30,710
absolutely irreducible faculties of mine

181
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,559
knowledge

182
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:32,180
feeling

183
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,590
and desire

184
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,620
on this gives us the classical so-called
trilogy of mind what psychology is all

185
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,750
about cognitive states

186
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,540
that have to do with

187
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,750
on knowing and believing things

188
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,940
affect in-state for abortion will state
we have to do

189
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,170
feeling things

190
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,080
and the cognitive states are
motivational states

191
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,870
that have to do with desire read or
wanting things

192
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,800
and when khan says that

193
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
there are these three stalled

194
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,410
faculties knowledge

195
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,709
feeling and desire our absolutely
irreducible

196
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:09,410
what he says if you can't get one from
the other

197
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,330
are that there is something

198
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,450
qualitatively different

199
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,800
then there is about

200
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,350
wanting something or feeling something
they call it was a very good about

201
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,430
expressing exactly what those
qualitative differences are you simply

202
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,859
asserted uh... that they are uh...

203
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:30,120
that they're qualitatively different but
i think if you think

204
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,399
wanted to just kind of

205
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,220
reflect on your own mental states for a
moment

206
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,910
on think about when you were

207
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,560
feelings of a motion allstate door

208
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,590
desiring all hamburger or a snickers bar
or whatever it is to be divider

209
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,520
homework thinking about some of our
problem in calculus or whatever

210
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,500
that those

211
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,240
three different kinds of states knowing
feeling the desiring

212
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,040
have some qualitative differences all
about them

213
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,980
and we'll come back

214
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,779
to arkansas idea that these are your
reducible faculties of mine

215
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:04,150
column for the compliment

216
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,880
so now let's just kind of focus for a
moment

217
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,420
on various kinds of cognitive states

218
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,900
of which perhaps most of what bob dole

219
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,310
states home sensation on and perception

220
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,389
the force of a risk for developing

221
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:21,129
in terms of

222
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:24,790
palm harbor what what are known as
sensory quality out

223
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,889
one-for-one floss first talk about
quality of the refer to

224
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:33,070
the subjective qualities of various are
conscious experiences

225
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:37,590
and we can think about these subjective
qualities as differing in uh... in a

226
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,340
variety of ways

227
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,410
first with respect to the sensory
modalities

228
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,160
seen something

229
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,340
is that qualitatively different
experience than hearing something

230
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:52,390
smelling something as a qualitatively
different experience than tasting

231
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,049
something

232
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:53,960
on and and

233
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,190
and and so on

234
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,529
now maybe we can kind of

235
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:58,340
reduce

236
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,360
pasting them vision or something like
that

237
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,610
but that's not what the way we
experience things of at all

238
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,030
there are qualitatively different

239
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,960
states of consciousness associated with
these various instrumentality

240
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,249
and also within each sensory modality

241
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:17,970
there are qualitatively

242
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,740
qualities ok retrieved by the way of
thinking about quali up

243
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,949
or within vision

244
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:27,010
those are the difference between seen
red and seeing blue

245
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,519
within got station

246
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,890
the difference between peace team suite

247
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,509
and pasting sour this something that's
like

248
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:37,850
to see something that's red that's
different from what it's like to see

249
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,790
something

250
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,460
to see something that's flu

251
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,760
so has been a lot of interest in
promoting the flossie of mind especially

252
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,150
since descartes

253
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:52,340
in the nature of these all of these
quali abuse at the zone subjective

254
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,850
qualities of conscious experience

255
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,130
and although general philosophical
approach to quali a

256
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,810
is nicely summarized by loss for daniel
bennett actually doesn't policeman

257
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,970
quality

258
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,540
albany says what your believing quali
episode what you believe in

259
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,090
that the whole goal quali i have these
four properties

260
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,400
the first of which is the most important
for our purposes

261
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,630
which is that

262
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,629
followed by the quality are art
ineffable

263
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:22,530
all somehow that is

264
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,690
that it's difficult

265
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,600
it's impossible

266
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,830
to describe hall what

267
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,600
sensory experience is like

268
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,399
onto dot

269
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,650
to somebody else

270
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,890
if you think about it for a moment what
is that exactly is it like to

271
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,820
see something

272
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,180
well you know what it's like to see
something and you know that it's not

273
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,350
that different to see something

274
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,039
called on her that it that it is the
care something

275
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,770
but try to convey that

276
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,509
goes to different experiences to
somebody else

277
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,869
and you find yourself

278
00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:55,880
quite literally apple loss for words

279
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,129
same thing goes when you tried to convey
to somebody else

280
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:02,329
what it's like to see red as opposed to
blue

281
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:06,500
how do you describe blue

282
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,590
ads not so easy act

283
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,120
art that's what we mean by quality of
our ineffable

284
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,630
the second property of quality of

285
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:19,400
is that they are intrinsic to various
kinds of states which is to say

286
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,750
that you can't really analyzed them into
something more basic you can reduce

287
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,779
these all

288
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:29,270
these qualitative song

289
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,520
that sent three states

290
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,890
to something else

291
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,509
if i put up walden

292
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:35,660
uh... if i put a whole

293
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,410
northwst waffle orange for example you
know i said

294
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,260
all you know that thing of our image
there that looks kinda or red and it

295
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,190
looks kind of yellow

296
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,390
alternate that's fine

297
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:52,320
it looks kind of red looks kind of
yelling out tell me what red looks like

298
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,770
alright there we go

299
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,470
orange maybe isn't

300
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,430
of of one of these basic sensory quali a

301
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,050
but red and yellow apparently are

302
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,920
for mug and that there comes a point
where you just can't have a lights and

303
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,000
the uh... any longer

304
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,840
quali are are held to be private

305
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,580
that is to say

306
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,440
i have an experience of bread

307
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,840
and you interview has an experience of
bread

308
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,170
but it's not going to be possible for me
to compare by experience of red to your

309
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,310
experience ret

310
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,900
there's some there's a barrier there

311
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,190
all uh... that prevents us from making
any kinds of comparisons

312
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,660
between one person's mental state

313
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,170
and another person's mental state

314
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,040
and the final property subclause first
talk about

315
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,700
when they talk about quality

316
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,659
the basically all qualities of sensory
experience

317
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,589
or directly apprehended

318
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,070
that is there not

319
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,980
mediated by anything else you don't say

320
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,170
all wat do u hav that's that must be
read

321
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,430
are you available speedo some words
raised his head back to us are tearing

322
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,769
straight

323
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:04,519
you're just experience it as what it is
you don't you're not making any kind of

324
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,169
judgment

325
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,010
all about it so

326
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,229
although when they believe in quality or
not

327
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:10,889
all of these are the properties

328
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:13,400
that quality of are supposed to happen

329
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,419
now let's illustrate this a little bit

330
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:21,380
are beginning with of with old problem
posed by another floss for frank jackson

331
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,930
all who focused on this quality of the
adaptability aryan is thought experiment

332
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,820
concerning marry the color blind
scientists to spot expert goes by

333
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,850
number of names

334
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,390
but they all have meri

335
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,380
colour blinded scientists

336
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,660
all in them

337
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,740
anne r dot jackson asks us to imagine

338
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,590
of all the problem in meri who's a are

339
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,090
visual neuroscientist

340
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:49,410
who has been raised her entire life in
eight chromatic chamber

341
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,090
all

342
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:51,340
gold

343
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,720
uh... the uh... what was to be a lawyer
or in shades of gray black and white

344
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,520
and uh... and shades of gray

345
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,320
so that she's had no experience of red
and green in all of that

346
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,160
nevertheless mary knows all there is
about the nervous system analyst in

347
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,800
particular she knows all there is to
know

348
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
about hong

349
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,010
about uh... of the visual science and
hong kong revision works and all that

350
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,310
kind of stuff

351
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,020
and jackson asks us to what magid

352
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,880
all-white

353
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,479
happens

354
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:25,510
when mary for the first time walks out
of this

355
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,160
fault though the a chromatic world that
you've been living in for her entire

356
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,260
life

357
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,810
into a world

358
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,220
room of the room like this

359
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,270
harbo she have any kind of new
experience

360
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,180
i'll

361
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,860
something i've never thought of before

362
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,610
so that i've never experienced before or
does she say that's right by knew all

363
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,820
along that that's what red looked like
because i know everything there is to

364
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,709
know

365
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:54,610
about the nervous system

366
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,340
jackson's intuition and most people's
intuition is that mary will have a new

367
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,250
experience

368
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,360
when she moves into this world

369
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,760
and uh... yet the ideas did she knows
all there is to know about coloring

370
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,130
color vision

371
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,640
madam eaters and odd lateral geniculate
nucleus and all that stuff

372
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,350
all but it's not enough

373
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:16,790
to give her another on or experience

374
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,150
all jackson also

375
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,870
of poses of pose a problem of

376
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,140
all which were will call the slightest
with supervision

377
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,410
or fred's a colleague of mary's home was
also a visual neuroscientist knows

378
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,210
everything there is to know

379
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,400
about home of them about the uh...

380
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,590
visual system

381
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,640
and in fact jackson s are stupid this
role

382
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,510
role so visual neuroscientist we know
everything there is general about the

383
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,520
visual system

384
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,600
but it turns out fred's kind of
interesting

385
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,690
he's got abou arrange on boggled a
vision that extends into the infrared or

386
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,640
into the oprah wire it verbal violence

387
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,990
home all wavelengths that most of us
park and see

388
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,470
and the jackson says what you've got an
observer here

389
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,139
who knows all the rest of the above the
river system

390
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:07,350
and then u_s_ good

391
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:14,350
well when fred looks at all true violet
light or infrared light one is ec

392
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,780
well if you knew everything that there
was no but the nervous system

393
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,580
well maybe you want to be able to answer
that question

394
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,900
and you really can't

395
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,480
answer that question

396
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,280
home

397
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,190
salarpuria again this is kind of inept
ability you can't

398
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,550
third-person description of salam
sensory system

399
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,260
to a first-person description of what

400
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,420
the hong

401
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,779
of what the experiences

402
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:42,960
now this is all lights these are the
kinds of things philosophers to us

403
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,520
right they make a living

404
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,820
on part of the hog

405
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,690
the conjuring up these kinds of things

406
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,870
what's interesting is

407
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,370
there's somebody like this

408
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,790
not nordiques

409
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,080
all who is a art of the food is in fact
a color scientist

410
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,790
who is in fact colorblind

411
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,240
arm

412
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,700
and he's written about his experiences
as what i got to know everything there

413
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,840
is the bowel about color vision

414
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,000
i know all the physics i know that all
the physiology of the colors system i

415
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,360
know all about receptors on

416
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,660
opponent prophecies of all that the
other kind of stuff

417
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,740
no by deal what these colors look like

418
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,200
on

419
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,940
and he knows all about golf

420
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,860
colour mixture and the metaphorical of
the implications of color and all that

421
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,880
kind of stuff

422
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,330
but he still has no idea what these
colors

423
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,350
so the point of this story is first

424
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,380
there is a philosophical challenge of
philosophical conundrum in wicker argue

425
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,820
about it all we want okay

426
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,790
but as we move towards the science of
consciousness

427
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,750
weekend actually begin to collect some
impure kal evidence

428
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,190
about various kinds of things there's
this one guy out there on god's green

429
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,240
earth

430
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,220
who happens to be

431
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,680
called the hoboken colors scientist who
knows everything there is to know about

432
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,370
color and whose nonetheless has no
experience

433
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,830
all ball of color

434
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,039
which suggests that jackson's intuition

435
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,330
uh... right

436
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,340
here's another case to case odd
described by oliver sacks

437
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,030
of the patient jayada

438
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,250
who was an artist of visual artist

439
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:26,250
who sustained a traumatic up all but the
injury to a part of his brain review for

440
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,750
right there

441
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,480
palm which all it would be now we know
is important for processing or color

442
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,160
experiences before is basically been
wiped out

443
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,880
on inpatient uh... jaaye

444
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,940
all and what's interesting is that

445
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,740
r_j_ ait no longer concede color at all

446
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,870
and he can't

447
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,370
imagine

448
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,750
what colors looked like he can do he
does a dream in color email dreams and

449
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,940
grayscale

450
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,980
all but he's retained

451
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,610
everything that

452
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:59,280
a trained artist knows about color the
color mixture of what color things are

453
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,820
and all that kind of business so we can
still do his work

454
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,500
but he joins

455
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,070
any longer have the experience of color

456
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,420
so here again is an empirical case

457
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,000
with more beat

458
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,430
which suggests that no wind

459
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,169
knowing all the wrist a dull

460
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:20,369
about the physics of the physiology of
color vision

461
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:22,960
isn't enough to give us the bong

462
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,130
give us the experience of color

463
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,220
we're going to take say more about quali
o a little bit later on

464
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,640
but let's take up on the other property
called bob consciousness that gets a lot

465
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,840
of attention in the philosophical
literature

466
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,250
and that is intention ality

467
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,020
a philosophical terms and this is
another thing the philosopher is due to

468
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,280
us with some are regularity they take a
permit has perfectly clear armenian and

469
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,470
english and they

470
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,840
turn it into something else

471
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,800
all when i say i intend to do something
like i am tend to feed my cat or uh...

472
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,690
or whatever

473
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,190
by declaring that i'm gonna love

474
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,090
engage in some kind of behavior

475
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,530
but that's not what intentionally means
and

476
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,300
philosophy

477
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,070
or rather of the

478
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,279
difficult philosophical term
intentionally comes from this latin term

479
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,510
in anzio

480
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,400
which refers to ideas

481
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,070
and the general ideas that intention
ality

482
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,800
has to do

483
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,080
palm

484
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,149
representations

485
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:24,640
of various kinds of objects

486
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,400
and this is for us for viennese
philosopher

487
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,020
german alternate

488
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,779
volvo prawns brent auto

489
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:32,529
who had this idea

490
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:35,010
that all of mental life

491
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,460
was characterized

492
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,710
by intention ality

493
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,679
as brent i don't put it

494
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,590
intention now will be is the more called
the mental

495
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,400
or by which he meant that all mental
states are intentional in nature

496
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,830
and all only mental states

497
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:53,170
are intentional inmates

498
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,629
and when he says intentionally as the
work of the mental what he says it

499
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:59,700
all mental states or about something

500
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,139
remember that character of consciousness
that james talked about

501
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:08,830
that all mental states are about
something or other than themselves

502
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,909
they represent something else

503
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:14,060
that's what friends connell uh... was
uh... was getting at

504
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,399
so the i did for the general idea here

505
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:19,799
is that consciousness is
representational or conscious mental

506
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:26,799
states or always about something else

507
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,740
yeah there's a connection between your
mental state and something in the

508
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,470
outside world

509
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,720
that's right for mental state

510
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,730
isn't just about itself it's about

511
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,570
display i'm

512
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,940
not know governmental stateful of you

513
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,470
palms and in a moment it's going to be

514
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,870
so now that's an interesting problem

515
00:23:53,870 --> 00:24:00,300
alm bertrand russell english forsberg
kind of bald of

516
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,510
and added to our understanding of this

517
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,340
all by arguing that intention albee
really comes in the form of what russell

518
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,550
called

519
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,270
propositional additives

520
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:13,510
all which takes a formal or mental
states take the form of

521
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,559
john believes that it's raining outside

522
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,980
and russell argued

523
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,950
that intention alley

524
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,699
includes

525
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:24,140
some proposition about the world

526
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,950
that's the thing that my mental state is
about

527
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,950
solomon attitude which represents the
nature

528
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,260
my mental state

529
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,790
all propositions are statements that
have truth value it's either raining

530
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,440
outside or it's not raining outside

531
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,179
and then the added to

532
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,580
all it is equivalent to some state like

533
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,720
believe e north eighteen or no way

534
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,429
whatever

535
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:49,300
home

536
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,980
it's not the if somebody says it's
raining outside

537
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,950
fact that it's raining outside is not my
mental state that's a state of the world

538
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,100
my mental state is my belief that it's
raining outside or my perception that

539
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,990
it's raining outside or my knowledge
that it's raining outside

540
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,230
so all these mental states

541
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,960
actually take uh... victims for

542
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,190
now that take you a long way towards
thinking about intention ality and uh...

543
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,680
in consciousness

544
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,370
ust especially if you think about
consciousness in terms of so-called

545
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,650
cognitive states

546
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,190
states of knowledge or all or uh... or
believe

547
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,210
but when you start thinking about nam
cognitive states

548
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,170
you begin to get into a little bit of
trouble

549
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,770
ice right now have a mental state

550
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,550
on one sheet

551
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,980
not a serious mental state like to live

552
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,770
are by far the third level so that i
want to pizza

553
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:50,350
home and that is why emotional say on
light on it like pizza

554
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,330
on and i'd like to have a pizza sometime
soon

555
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,850
all of that so that so that's an
emotional state but if you think about

556
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,129
it for a second that is might

557
00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:03,600
mental state at the moment the i could
tell you right now i'd like to use its

558
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,830
about the fact that i

559
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,850
dislike pizza

560
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,310
all i want to pizza it's not the fact
that i don't want a piece of but there

561
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:13,950
really isn't any propositional content
here where's the proposition

562
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,370
there is an attitude

563
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,260
an attitude of lighting or an attitude
of wanting

564
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,730
but there is a dead heat

565
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,880
uh... but there isn't any propositional
content

566
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,669
so there's a challenge here

567
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:27,179
which is if we're going to say

568
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:32,000
state some knowledge feeling then desire
our here we are doing some bull

569
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,430
faculties of mine

570
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:38,050
we know how to describe cognitive states
states of knowledge in terms of

571
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,290
propositional attitudes

572
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:44,450
but it's not entirely clear how we
should characterize or emotional or only

573
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,159
be emotional motivational states

574
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,250
now one

575
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,180
solution to this

576
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:54,150
that's been offered by psychologists
especially stanley schachter and his

577
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,700
colleagues were on the center

578
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,240
and a famous paper

579
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,980
all about uh... love them

580
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,690
or the by the motion published in
nineteen sixty two

581
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,889
brush actor and singer basically argued

582
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,830
that emotional and motivational states

583
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,720
really can be reduced a cognitive states

584
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,760
that is that kant was wrong

585
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,080
that states of fielding and desire are
irreducible this to uh...

586
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,509
two states of knowledge

587
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:20,809
they took the position that in fact

588
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:24,820
when you say that who'd web when john
says that he likes pizza

589
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,030
what john

590
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,060
really

591
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,120
means

592
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,240
john believes that he likes pizza
doesn't really like pizza he just thinks

593
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,090
he does

594
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:34,799
all

595
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,279
and when john once a pizza

596
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,090
what he reeled off his mental state
really is

597
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,770
although that the state of belief that
he believes he wants pizza

598
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,460
all but he doesn't uh... but

599
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,360
stop the case of the actually once that
he just thinks it does

600
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,000
and by this kind of gambit

601
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,070
you can add propositional content

602
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:59,000
he wants pizza if you like speed so
that's a perfectly fine proposition

603
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,229
and then you add the added to

604
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:02,890
volvo all believe to it

605
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,250
to get the emotion

606
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,250
schachter and server really quite
serious about this

607
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,549
all of

608
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:09,809
of the the bills

609
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:14,350
famous songs our theory of a motion
lasted for a good thirty forty years of

610
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,270
still around

611
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,320
those who took it provoked a recent
college e read about this theory in your

612
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,950
hard with a textbook part no

613
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,260
on emotion

614
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,160
and it's something that still with us
today there's a group of for new

615
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,789
philosophers

616
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:30,890
part of the new atheists

617
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:34,210
small who owns argue the people who
don't actually believe in god

618
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:39,090
they just believe they do

619
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,360
uh... an

620
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,840
had that struck the same kind of quality
to it

621
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,710
but what's going on here is that shocked
arresting or are in fact

622
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,260
dead body

623
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,150
and say look

624
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,950
we can always reduced

625
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,309
an emotional state to a cognitive state

626
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:56,840
we can always reduced motivational state

627
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,260
to some kind of car the state and there
are no fistfights

628
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,980
on professional meetings o about whether
this is the case

629
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:10,980
yep quick question

630
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,049
yahoo arguably be what you like or wont
but you don't really

631
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:22,879
or one

632
00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:26,280
yet about your notice actor and singer
experiment

633
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,300
okay much actress ever did to make a
really brief i wasnt to do this but all

634
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,410
do it anyway

635
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:36,260
all what schachter a singer did was to
uh... take subjects and on

636
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,380
surreptitiously

637
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,490
inject them with a drug epitaph trend
that the audience that induces a state

638
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:46,360
of physiological arousal never mind how
they did this located at

639
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,780
palm and uh... o

640
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,840
heartburn

641
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,980
all later on in the experiment

642
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,830
are they put the person who was now in
the state of physiological arousal with

643
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,180
a

644
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,590
schachter actually characterizes the
person is ours

645
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,520
of school gym

646
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,330
ordered the confederate of the
experimenter

647
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:07,740
who within one condition was behaving in
a very dat happy matter

648
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,130
and another condition of the experiment
was behaved in a very hostile angry

649
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,180
manner

650
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,030
all and that's the important is

651
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,220
environment with this person you're
feeling physiologically aroused and then

652
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,560
schachter and singer asked you what you
were

653
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,230
okay and it turned out that subjects who
were

654
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,979
fought with the who were tested

655
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:29,029
in the presence of a happy confederate

656
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,419
said that they were happy

657
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:31,830
and subjects were tested

658
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,160
in the presence of

659
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,460
an angry confederate said that they were
angry

660
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,290
and what schachter answer your concluded
from this is that we interpret our state

661
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:45,450
official physiological arousal with
almost all states have in common

662
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,710
by looking to the environment and to
trying to determine

663
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,280
all broke from the environment accusers
to that that basically explains why were

664
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,120
around

665
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,850
so if i morale is in the context of a
happy person so i must be happy

666
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,890
and if i'm around in the context of an
angry person i'd say must be angry

667
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,440
that's the general idea here

668
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,309
visited exactly this way

669
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:09,429
you're reducing an emotional state

670
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:11,470
to will belief

671
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,139
emotional state

672
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:14,160
you're reducing an emotional state

673
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,320
to apartment

674
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,799
shell that's

675
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,480
really aleman osama

676
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,289
that

677
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:24,330
let's go to the forward their willingham
discussed three

678
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:29,540
the third all aspect all called the
consciousness of the force routes or

679
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,060
talk about allot

680
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,590
which is all which is the the

681
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,100
the aspect of subjectivity

682
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,510
alm which is

683
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,610
nowhere

684
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:45,200
federer at all of the decks preston by
of berkeley zone home

685
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,770
or flow through drugs for all

686
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,440
conscious states exist

687
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,580
all lee as they are experienced by like
human or animal subject

688
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,690
remember from last time wouldn't makes
is really interesting distinction

689
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,840
between

690
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,309
physics

691
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:03,570
and psychology that physics is the
science of experience without an

692
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,600
experience in subject

693
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,850
and psychology is the size of experience
with an experience in subject sorrel is

694
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,989
trying to get at

695
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:11,580
part of that at the

696
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,660
the same kind of thing

697
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,950
and all basically says the pope

698
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,060
conscious mental states

699
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,320
have a subjective mode of existence
flip-flops principle

700
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,050
hong kong on call on college e they
exist or waived by virtue of having

701
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,520
someone who actually experiences

702
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,469
if there's no one to experience some

703
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:32,289
that they don't exist at all

704
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:36,740
which is different from all other island
features of the world

705
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,819
in general

706
00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:41,299
have existence is independent of the
observer

707
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:42,509
this table

708
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:47,200
on that wall the clouds and the skye
outside the trees and all that stuff

709
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,909
they exist whether the experience them
or not

710
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:51,480
but conscious states

711
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,779
only exist in so far

712
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:56,990
as of that as as they were experienced
by someone

713
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,430
and that gives harm

714
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:03,659
all unconscious mental states a spurt
come interesting quality hard for them

715
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:06,119
and also opposes the challenge for

716
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:11,410
a scientific approach to consciousness
which is

717
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,550
of the level from last time

718
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:17,730
science is supposed to be talking about
the objective and the public

719
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:21,690
consciousness is subjective in private
how can you possibly have

720
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,740
say they are

721
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,920
the about science of consciousness

722
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,330
kind of signed posters for you a little
bit sir also qual that's problem repeat

723
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:37,320
uh... that did if you want to do science
you gotta figure out haha do this and he

724
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,719
simply points out

725
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:40,090
that the fact

726
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:44,120
the subject matter is onto logically
subjective

727
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,990
doesn't necessarily preclude plus from
had been epistemic lee object to the

728
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,860
sites that has passed

729
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,049
objective knowledge

730
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:53,750
about uh... all of these kinds of things

731
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,980
an old chin trying on

732
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,490
towards the end of this what your
certainly on one st

733
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,289
to show you how really psychologist
tried to do just that

734
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:03,540
which was to have

735
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,590
and epistemic lee

736
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,730
objective science

737
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,929
all of them onto logically

738
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,999
subject re

739
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:13,739
but just to keep a couple of suffers
right now

740
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:18,329
this subjectivity ald part of the aspect
of consciousness

741
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:22,769
how was i think nowhere better hog tie
the character done by for another plus

742
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,509
for thomas naval at n_y_u_

743
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:29,359
all did a famous essay that you're going
to see references to

744
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,569
of the later on

745
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,499
what is it like to be a batch

746
00:34:33,499 --> 00:34:36,429
and what naples point here is

747
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:39,079
if you have a consciousness perry mrs

748
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,189
then there is something that's like

749
00:34:41,189 --> 00:34:42,259
to have them

750
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:44,330
if you have conscious experiences

751
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:48,400
there's something it's like to be an
organism that can have are conscious

752
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,539
spirit

753
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:53,979
fundamentally an organism has conscious
mental states if in oriya

754
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:56,869
there's something that it's like to be
that organism

755
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:58,630
something that it's like

756
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,430
that organism so it's something that's
very there's something it's like

757
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,049
for me to have the experience of red

758
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:09,509
all but when you hold a you already
object up in front of your cellphone

759
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:11,910
camera

760
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,880
completely obviously

761
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,769
there's something it's like for your
cellphone camera

762
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:18,190
you know that there's something it's
like for you

763
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,379
and what it's like is different from
what it's like when you see green

764
00:35:22,379 --> 00:35:23,440
what it's like

765
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,619
when you smell bob woodward but when you
taste sweet

766
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:28,489
is different from what it's like

767
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:29,809
or when the parliament

768
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:31,519
when you can start work

769
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:32,959
hong and for that matter

770
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:35,069
since that you have

771
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:35,780
ultrasonic area

772
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,940
they could hear frequencies weekend here

773
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,020
there is something that's like to be a
bad

774
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,070
that's not what it's like to be arts
uh... they have different kinds of uh...

775
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,969
sensory

776
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:48,259
censored capacity

777
00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:52,239
um... they steeple

778
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:55,210
sold now let's just try to take this the

779
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,850
philosophical background which is

780
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:01,050
aside from next monday just about all
the philosophy you're gonna get out of

781
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,929
me

782
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:06,889
cassettes just about all the force be
i'd have to give

783
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:11,520
let's take some of these questions and
use them to with some of these debates

784
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,749
and use them to re frames hobart

785
00:36:14,749 --> 00:36:16,959
questions about conscious

786
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:20,819
first as we think we have conscious
mental states we we experience ourselves

787
00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:22,999
as had been conscious mental state

788
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:25,140
but some psychologists have argued

789
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,940
that we also have off one conscious
mental states

790
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,899
that is states of knowledge

791
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:32,370
feeling that desire

792
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:37,349
that we have been that dog uh... that
influence or behavior

793
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:41,519
but which were not aware of having we
don't have time to six p reinstalled

794
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:47,119
so now we have a question about whether
things like waali up the redness of read

795
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,459
the saw weirdness of slower

796
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:52,530
or home argued would order for it

797
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,569
intentional states wanting the peace or
like in the pizza

798
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:57,789
can in any sense beyond conscious

799
00:36:57,789 --> 00:36:59,849
this is a question mark hall

800
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:00,950
come up against

801
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,179
home later

802
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,849
the semester

803
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:04,340
harsh

804
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,519
another question

805
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:06,749
kenneth is a true

806
00:37:06,749 --> 00:37:08,220
for example

807
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,440
that palm

808
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,060
whole conscious mental states are
qualitative states or all conscious

809
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,039
mental states are intentional states

810
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,640
ten-year have consciousness

811
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,800
without

812
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,209
intention ality

813
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:21,779
rent auto said no

814
00:37:21,779 --> 00:37:24,469
that intention only is the work of the
mental

815
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:28,430
all mental states or intentional in
nature any statements intentional is

816
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,809
mental in nature

817
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:30,770
that swine

818
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,690
but there are quite people like

819
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,599
zen

820
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,579
meditate urs

821
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:36,609
who argued

822
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:39,239
that they have conscious mental states

823
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:39,979
once a year

824
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:42,869
get the santori for whatever it's called

825
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,069
hongkong

826
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:45,469
all of that they have

827
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:47,589
or conscious mental states

828
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:49,180
part about anything at all

829
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,829
europe you work

830
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:54,099
now that's an interesting point

831
00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:57,979
haha we would know this is not
completely clear

832
00:37:57,979 --> 00:38:01,449
it's at least a question about whether
you can actually have a conscious mental

833
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:01,900
state

834
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,589
that doesn't have any qualitative on
characteristics to it

835
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:06,699
or better yet

836
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:09,770
a conscious mental state that isn't
above which

837
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,270
anything

838
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,089
at all

839
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:14,560
trend nonhuman animals

840
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,909
have are going to have bob have
intentional states

841
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:20,519
all we know we can

842
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:25,209
our budget tenured auger my character or
somebody's chimpanzee or somebody's

843
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:26,439
earthworm or whatever

844
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:27,699
all have while

845
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:29,969
uh... have constantly states

846
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:33,029
in anything like the way that we can
have

847
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:34,569
conscious mental state

848
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:37,639
and just to get back to the cellphone
example

849
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:39,819
we can know them can machines

850
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:41,589
have intentional states

851
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:43,849
on your cell phone

852
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:44,529
thermostat

853
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:46,999
uh... really good computer

854
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:49,860
on does it had anything like

855
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,789
intentionally

856
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:53,399
intentionally attached to it

857
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:56,929
and there are floss first talk about the
briefly

858
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:59,429
next week that you'll read about them

859
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:01,660
who actually say yes

860
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,289
on david chalmers

861
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:07,470
or very prominent for thr is worth a lot
about consciousness

862
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,999
quite happy with the idea

863
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:12,210
that thermostat self-consciousness

864
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:16,339
it's pretty impoverished consciousness
apparently all blood

865
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:17,420
it's again

866
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,870
and then finally we get to the big one

867
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,529
which is

868
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:23,259
we know we have these things

869
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:26,990
descartes seven what whatnot i'm fifty
and i'm thinking about thinking there is

870
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,829
that i can doubt that

871
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:32,690
jane says as soon as we look into our
minds we find mental states

872
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,309
but now the question is

873
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:38,059
actually cause anything

874
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:40,389
do conscious states

875
00:39:40,389 --> 00:39:44,879
a causal role in the world

876
00:39:44,879 --> 00:39:49,519
for our date more or less the phenomenal

877
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:51,440
these are the kinds of things that uh...

878
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,369
that uh... but we could talk about

879
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:56,479
let's take a couple of minutes just to
develop a couple of these things in

880
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:57,899
terms of

881
00:39:57,899 --> 00:40:00,479
in terms of inside

882
00:40:00,479 --> 00:40:05,569
first let's return to the definition of
consciousness in terms of quality

883
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,470
that consciousness has to do

884
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,380
with various qualities of

885
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,799
all of experience

886
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:15,969
we have a sensory modalities like
hearing in vision and got station of all

887
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:16,460
faction

888
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,249
and there's something it's like to see
something

889
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:23,559
that somehow different from what it's
like the taste

890
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:27,000
and we have these various sensory
qualities within our

891
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,709
of various instrumentality

892
00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:33,009
if there's something it's like to see
red

893
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:36,659
different from what it's like to see
blue

894
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:40,479
and so on and most we can now begin to
ask questions what

895
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,259
where it is it's come from

896
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:47,249
where does seeing and hearing come from
uh... where it is seen red vs the of

897
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:48,539
blue come from

898
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:52,249
this is a question that has been
addressed scientifically since the

899
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,719
beginning of of the nineteenth century

900
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,690
by people

901
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:00,930
who are involved in an to while
subfields of psychology and biology

902
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,489
known as sense recycle physics

903
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:04,359
and all

904
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:06,539
and sensory

905
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:09,199
sensory girl physiology

906
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,029
let's look at

907
00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:12,069
the various instrumentality

908
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,060
how many different ways do we have

909
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,709
to sense the world

910
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:21,929
what different kinds of said three for
instance do we have

911
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:24,339
aristotle famously argued that there
were five

912
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:26,300
uh... senses

913
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,339
vision audition

914
00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:28,150
bus station

915
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,389
or faction

916
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:33,869
and the tactile sensor sense volvo touch

917
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:38,419
see i shall renton an important or a
physiologist on in the sort of lectures

918
00:41:38,419 --> 00:41:42,279
uh... earlier in the twentieth century
argued that aristotle was on the right

919
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:45,069
track that he didn't quite have count
right

920
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:49,139
of that and that we have at least uh...
that at least eight

921
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,349
sense river valleys

922
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:53,129
uh... aristotle's five

923
00:41:53,129 --> 00:41:54,730
there's formal sense

924
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:58,799
that there were startled mister sense of
warm cold and hot

925
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:03,140
and bad there or are two hein so
appropriate sanctions

926
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,609
children called them

927
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:07,039
patroness basis the sense of movement

928
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,799
which are us total published justo
reducible to the sense of touch

929
00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:15,489
uh... and equilibrium the sense of
balance which i think aristotle also

930
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:19,009
fought was reducible sense

931
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:20,739
harsh arijit also argued

932
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:23,409
that there are some other sensory
modalities

933
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:27,999
all of that clearly operate a center but
albee's but interestingly don't give

934
00:42:27,999 --> 00:42:30,809
rise to conscious sensation

935
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:34,920
song recall these intro ception if you
think about it for a second

936
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,039
all hotmail static regulation

937
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:39,670
you experience that your body
experiences

938
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,199
your body

939
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,799
blood sugars levels dropped

940
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:47,420
and your hypothetical skaggs into
instigate eating behavior

941
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,959
right that's

942
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,280
there has to be some kind of sensory
mechanism

943
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,009
that the text changes and blood sugar
level

944
00:42:54,009 --> 00:42:58,210
your hypertonic split exchanges and
although uh...

945
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,839
phone cell beaulieu

946
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,909
poland and instigate stringent behavior

947
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:05,149
so there has to be something like a
sensory mechanism

948
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,819
that all of that

949
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:08,189
protects that

950
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:08,899
palm

951
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:12,899
ocular cues to things like our motion

952
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:17,999
depth perception there's feedback from
your audience onto your visual system

953
00:43:17,999 --> 00:43:22,819
that provides information about for you
know promotion distance of objects o

954
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:24,110
from you the observer

955
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,329
but you're not consciously aware of any
of these sensations

956
00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:28,320
they do account

957
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,979
and sensations

958
00:43:29,979 --> 00:43:31,779
you're not consciously aware of

959
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:33,890
so we can begin to think about

960
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,319
gave these four they did these eight

961
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,589
all modalities of sensation

962
00:43:38,589 --> 00:43:43,069
different ways of sense in the world
each of them qualitatively different

963
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:44,219
from the other one

964
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:45,500
and the question is

965
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,849
where do these qualities come from

966
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:51,379
well we know from the work of people
like sharon could

967
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,229
that each sensory modality

968
00:43:54,229 --> 00:43:58,400
is defined in terms of made more or less
unique

969
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,180
package all features

970
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,529
there it is playing

971
00:44:02,529 --> 00:44:05,319
there's a proximal stimulus

972
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:09,289
song pattern of physical energy is
that's recreated from an object that

973
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:10,069
falls on

974
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:12,169
the sensor receptors

975
00:44:12,169 --> 00:44:14,879
are there are the century sectors
themselves

976
00:44:14,879 --> 00:44:19,809
the rods and combs in the eyes basilar
membrane and the uh... in the inner ear

977
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:21,140
or so on

978
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,760
on that takes most in your standard used

979
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,679
entrance to system to a neural impulse

980
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:28,349
there's a sense retract

981
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:30,170
the bundle of nerves

982
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:35,589
that carries that sensory impulses in
towards the in towards the brain

983
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,990
and there is a sensory projection oreo
somewhere in the brain

984
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:43,559
that is the final destination point for
the sensory impulses

985
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:47,059
gives rise to these various kinds of
conscious experiences

986
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,689
and the general idea here

987
00:44:48,689 --> 00:44:53,989
is that you tried always eight sensory
modalities identified by sharon tan

988
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:59,179
confidently is defined by unique all
package of these features and just use

989
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:01,109
the example of white per second

990
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:05,459
the proximal stimulus revision is light
waves of a particular wavelength three

991
00:45:05,459 --> 00:45:07,940
hundred eighty two seven hundred
eighteen animators

992
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,420
on wavelength

993
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,700
all lightwave stimulate rods and calls
on the rat know i'll be all right

994
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,859
which gave rise to honor roll impulse
was electrical signals

995
00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:21,940
that are carried along the optic nerve
and a couple of other bundles of birds

996
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:22,900
to the op

997
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,989
the occipital cortex

998
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,260
almost out of the brain

999
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,520
which gives rise to the experience

1000
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,849
orble

1001
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:33,989
of vision

1002
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:37,299
one of these are really important to me
that's the whole package of some bom bom

1003
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:38,869
bom sensation

1004
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:44,319
and of the sensory nineteenth-century
phone percent three song physiologist

1005
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,140
began to identify all

1006
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,519
these kinds of things we know about the
bells were membrane and the oracle

1007
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:51,200
reader

1008
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,989
report that

1009
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:55,260
all joint johannes builder

1010
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,639
thoughtful under a leader of the century
physiologist

1011
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:00,729
also the port

1012
00:46:00,729 --> 00:46:03,710
sensory modality is associate with these
different packages

1013
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,169
or both of properties

1014
00:46:05,169 --> 00:46:07,469
but the one that's most important

1015
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:09,569
turns out

1016
00:46:09,569 --> 00:46:11,769
there's a specific

1017
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:12,910
pathway

1018
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:15,349
that underlies each home

1019
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:18,140
each of the modalities

1020
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:22,359
it turns out that you don't see
something because electromagnetic

1021
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:25,229
radiation falls on the rods and columns
of the aisle

1022
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:27,570
and the reason we know that is the close
your eyes

1023
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:31,209
and become electrically stimulate the
rods and cones me still see stuff

1024
00:46:31,209 --> 00:46:33,940
see patterns alike

1025
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,100
get behind it be alright

1026
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,379
electrically stimulate your optic nerve
and you'll still

1027
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:42,759
stuff even though your eyes are closed
and you're in a darkened room and all

1028
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:48,009
that and then finally because drop
microelectrode stone into your hall into

1029
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:48,439
your honor

1030
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,059
on occipital lobe

1031
00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:52,699
and don't stimulate you and you'll still

1032
00:46:52,699 --> 00:46:56,049
love them something but you'll see
something

1033
00:46:56,049 --> 00:46:57,019
here's something

1034
00:46:57,019 --> 00:47:00,789
we put those electrodes in the old
auditory cortex of your temporal lobe

1035
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:01,740
right about there

1036
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,929
you'll hear something

1037
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:04,469
you won't see something

1038
00:47:04,469 --> 00:47:06,419
so now we know

1039
00:47:06,419 --> 00:47:10,129
one of the reasons that these quality
that these that there are these

1040
00:47:10,129 --> 00:47:14,729
qualitative distinctions among various
sensory modalities is that he sensory

1041
00:47:14,729 --> 00:47:18,080
modality is associated with a different
part of the brain

1042
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,320
that gives rise

1043
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,119
two deeds on these various kinds of

1044
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,989
conscious experiences

1045
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:28,779
and so as we now know

1046
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:32,279
somehow we could

1047
00:47:32,279 --> 00:47:35,539
the rods in cones and you're right

1048
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:36,869
your temporal cortex

1049
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:39,579
as opposed to your occipital cortex

1050
00:47:39,579 --> 00:47:42,459
you'd hear

1051
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:43,480
is not

1052
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,190
bergsten realistic gives rise to the
sensory experience to the conscious

1053
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:50,249
experience and sensation

1054
00:47:50,249 --> 00:47:53,089
where the stimulus gold

1055
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:55,389
uh... on

1056
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:58,909
what the final para what the final
destination of that they're old and

1057
00:47:58,909 --> 00:47:59,779
pollsters

1058
00:47:59,779 --> 00:48:00,859
that tells us

1059
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:03,640
what the various modalities of
sensational

1060
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,389
now we've got this worked out really
well

1061
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:08,119
four

1062
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:09,390
and for hearing

1063
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:14,109
and for go station and for all factions
the skin senses are pretty complicated

1064
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:18,189
but we convert that with that picture is
or the developing

1065
00:48:18,189 --> 00:48:20,130
free monthly as well

1066
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,130
but the general idea here is

1067
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:23,640
that we can begin

1068
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,939
through sensory physiology

1069
00:48:25,939 --> 00:48:27,420
paul did go to

1070
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,819
to begin to

1071
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:30,369
scientifically

1072
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:33,749
the question of baja many quali are
there

1073
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:35,209
starting with the question

1074
00:48:35,209 --> 00:48:36,720
of how many different

1075
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,680
waves they're roar

1076
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,449
for us to sends

1077
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:42,409
aristotle's five

1078
00:48:42,409 --> 00:48:47,019
something closer charade

1079
00:48:47,019 --> 00:48:50,689
stamp that's not the final answer to
wall of this but it's not a bad place to

1080
00:48:50,689 --> 00:48:53,419
start on the second day of class

1081
00:48:53,419 --> 00:48:55,199
home so let's stop there

1082
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,699
and on wednesday

1083
00:48:57,699 --> 00:48:58,799
another aspect

1084
00:48:58,799 --> 00:49:02,329
of the nineteenth century science of
consciousness which is the development

1085
00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:04,779
of sensory psycho physics

1086
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:08,169
which tries to understand the
relationship

1087
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:10,899
the physical properties of stimuli

1088
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:15,119
and the psychological properties all be
conscious experiences which these

1089
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,960
stimuli give arrives

1090
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,519
thank you very much will see you on
wednesday
