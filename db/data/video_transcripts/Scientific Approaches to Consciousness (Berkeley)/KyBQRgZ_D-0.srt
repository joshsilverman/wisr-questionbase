1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,360
pooh-pooh

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,140
okay last time we talked about

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,650
alterations of consciousness that occur
in the ordinary course of everyday

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,879
living

5
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:13,899
flavor truong phong shift in

6
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:15,189
attentional functioning

7
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:20,130
in absorption your attention has focused
intense leon one particular object

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,190
in daydreaming

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,259
your attention drifts away from the task
is supposed to be working on

10
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,490
and instead

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,640
on is occupied by

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,730
on material that's relevant to

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,380
of various kinds of barbarous kinds of
goals

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,770
what i want to do today is too hard pick
up on all of those things

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,620
and talk about mall

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,420
the similar kinds of states or allegedly
similar kinds of states

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,370
that occur in haldeman association would
want one or other kind of

18
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,720
formal meditative disciplines

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,270
now the true meditative disciplines that
i've gotten the most attention in the

20
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,740
scientific literature

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,800
and for that matter have got the most
attention in the popular of literature

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,580
our yoga

23
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,810
then nor some or all other writing of
buddhist meditation

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,810
and that's where might talk a scandal
focus on today

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,710
but i just want to make the point that

26
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,600
yeah i don't have to be

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,880
your going to be a hindu were a buddhist
in order to engage in all of the in

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,030
uh... they did in meditation

29
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,070
there are strong

30
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,790
vibrant meditative traditions in the
three great monotheistic

31
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,409
all-girl all religions

32
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,910
christianity judaism and hindu i hand up
and islam

33
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,890
and there are lots of other ordered the
kinds of meditation

34
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,950
but for reasons that i think are more
cultural cultural and historical than

35
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,010
anything else

36
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,619
all the footer truce focused on one

37
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:45,659
variant or the other

38
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,990
of yoga or home

39
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,130
road resent

40
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,520
so just to take a very long story very
short

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,650
all yoga discipline is based on
knowledge about the various aspects of

42
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,000
hindu philosophy

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,260
and the whole idea behind yoga as a
meditative practice

44
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,950
is to achieve some body

45
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,010
the total self collected this

46
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,229
which basically abolish is the
distinction between self and others of

47
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,590
blurs the boundary between the ego

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,690
on and off

49
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,379
and object

50
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:19,679
walton's oz then part of the city
meditation is based on uh... various

51
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:21,399
buddhist art of traditions

52
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:25,119
it's cool is to achieve nirvana horror
what you meant

53
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:27,969
and we you know you're in lightened

54
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:32,829
when you've got rid of all your desires
and your consciousness global

55
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,189
consciousness himself

56
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:35,250
as i say

57
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,299
one-story

58
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,999
it turns out that

59
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:45,099
all all of these meditative traditions
carmine one dob three basic forms

60
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,830
all the one-third or the younger and
then

61
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,129
arvo most people thought of as would
so-called one point meditations

62
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,159
where you take some object

63
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,950
some point of reference

64
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,280
and focus your attention on it all you
do you focus your attention upon that

65
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,849
object

66
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,410
or you engage in

67
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,069
bogdan variant on one point meditation

68
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,060
on which a budget

69
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,000
in which you not focused on anything at
all so that's the point you're focused

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,989
on

71
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,269
at all

72
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,649
all of them and there's a star forum
which is coming to prominence recently

73
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:17,989
with increased interest in tibetan

74
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,779
all forms of buddhism

75
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:21,870
known as compassion meditation

76
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,650
where you're not contemplating

77
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,760
you're not focusing your attention on
your breathing or some object in space

78
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,819
or whatever

79
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:30,159
what you're contemplating

80
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,549
thus offering all of the world in

81
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:35,919
so much for religion

82
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,979
though very first of all moved on to the
psychologist to take an active interest

83
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:44,329
in these meditative disciplines was a
guy named hartford aikman who did a lot

84
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:48,239
of writing in the nineteen sixties note
the date

85
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,519
first-grade consciousness revolution in
american culture people dropping drugs

86
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,209
and trying then they're doing all sorts
of things all right there in the middle

87
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,630
of the sixties

88
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,959
and also was also was altered like a man
who actually did so wonderful

89
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,129
called kind of analytic work not so much
experimental work

90
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:06,980
what really tried to

91
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,760
connect

92
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,980
especially zen

93
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,049
meditation up

94
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:13,679
the interests of blow modern uh...

95
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:16,239
uh... cognitive behavioral sciences

96
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,880
any argued that all these meditative
practices especially zen meditation

97
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,610
involved a of the uh... you know that

98
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,870
an element that he called contemplation

99
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,639
by which he meant non analytic
apprehension of an object

100
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,680
so the general idea just post the focus
your attention on in object

101
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,919
but not to think too much about it

102
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,080
don't don't don't engage in a lot of
elaborate of thought

103
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,330
are don't think about what it might mean
for you or that you're hungry and you

104
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,160
want to go up go to lunch or whatever it
is you want to do

105
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,930
which is supposed to do was kind of and
through your mind of everything but the

106
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,770
percept

107
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,050
including all the thoughts that you
might have about the percept

108
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,690
this is a really good percept alittle
like this percept whatever just get rid

109
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,629
of it

110
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,709
because in these in these traditions of
especially in the seven

111
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:05,899
all thought is or construed as
interference

112
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:09,909
and what you want to do is get all of
the again ins and with them

113
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,210
filled with the knowledge that really
matters

114
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,070
is obtained through perception not
through thinking

115
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,109
also you're supposed to be experiencing
all of the stuff

116
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,229
without thinking too much

117
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:21,739
thinking too much about it

118
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:25,440
like went further distinguish between
two kinds of contemplation

119
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,660
active contemplation word you're really
working out of your trying really hard

120
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,009
distant to keep your mind focused

121
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:33,589
on on on the object

122
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:37,229
you're doing kind of breathing exercises
and do it all sorts of other things the

123
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:39,020
kind of distract yourself

124
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,009
from things that would distract you from
on contemplation

125
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,449
all-party point you pointed out that
after you do this while gigi had really

126
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:48,689
good at it

127
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:51,370
and so when you went to the spiral basil

128
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,239
full contemplation

129
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:57,819
contemplation itself has been automatons
on just come to do it it's your time to

130
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:00,770
meditate this with the new meditation
you don't have to work very

131
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,770
along the way for that

132
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,539
beyond

133
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:09,139
the implication of this is that
contemplative meditation is a skill

134
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,449
it's a skill that has to be practiced

135
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,310
it's a skill that you get that a rat
with time

136
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,020
that's why they call it a meditative
discipline

137
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,589
and that's why you go and spend time in
a monastery to learn how to do this

138
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,469
long and dot

139
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,550
play video games

140
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,369
whatever else

141
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:27,709
did you want to do

142
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:32,719
om and so what did i could also argue
against just kind of uk conceptual

143
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:36,449
analysis of what's supposed to be going
on on your dad meditation

144
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,000
that what happens is that

145
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,580
by virtue of meditation

146
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,180
we shipped from what i couldn't called
the action mode

147
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,619
called experience

148
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:46,190
one that is based on

149
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,070
all understanding objects

150
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,099
for the purpose of manipulating and
changing them

151
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:52,889
ought to

152
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:57,639
what he called the receptivity road of
experience in which we simply experience

153
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,030
the environment

154
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,069
experience the object

155
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,439
for what artnet is all i think i was
like men but it was somebody along those

156
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:09,229
lines who argued that the essential
shifted takes place in of

157
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,880
in these kinds of meditative disciplines
is a shift from doing things

158
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,840
onto

159
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,330
letting things be

160
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:21,139
for what's the old zen joke don't trust
do something stand there

161
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,970
all of that's the general idea

162
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,319
home behind us

163
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,430
albany argued that

164
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,389
as you get better at this as you engage
in this kind of full contemplation that

165
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,159
practice meditate hers or the experience

166
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:39,040
then disheartened start to experience
all sorts of interesting phenomena

167
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,019
which he called

168
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,879
all done with which he drove group
called the the mystical experience

169
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,399
so first with what he called all the
reality transfer

170
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,900
in which your thoughts and images are
experienced

171
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,349
not as fought send images but as real
lob jerks in the external of above the

172
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:57,849
world

173
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:00,919
similar to that is what he called
sensory translation

174
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,890
where you're meant both process easy
although they get experience

175
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,479
nod as thoughts or ideas or as images

176
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,829
but as physical sensations who can
actually

177
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:14,319
ordered doesn't feel various kinds of
changes lonely in uh...

178
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,530
in your body

179
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,310
you also yet

180
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,979
on what log what we call the unity
between self and object

181
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,440
that is you

182
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,710
pursued you experience herself as one
with the object that you're trying to

183
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,750
contemplate

184
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,930
fluorine

185
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,649
breaking down dismantling those ego
boundaries

186
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,210
uh... between the self and others

187
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,480
and then he said

188
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,500
you know

189
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,919
it's really hard to describe this kind
of thing

190
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,320
because this experience that you have is
in some sense of ineffable

191
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,909
in much the same way that the quality of

192
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:52,920
or perceptual experience or a duffel
bore hoti describe read this old body

193
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,170
all along

194
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,610
also he argued

195
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,850
that home that these old

196
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,780
the these experiences were very very
very difficult to describe

197
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,540
they described as somebody else

198
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,700
finally here i think diaper and made his
most important contribution to the

199
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,320
psychology

200
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,440
for the science

201
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,880
all of all of this

202
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,789
is it he characterized the results of
contemplative meditation

203
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,500
as what he called

204
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,450
deal for comment is they should

205
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,310
of mental one

206
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,779
hauled

207
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:23,739
we argued that

208
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:26,590
by virtue of alone

209
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,779
carvel haldeman meditation

210
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:30,770
we know what we abandon our

211
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,140
habits of mind

212
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,020
we abandon those automatic process to
use that we used to apprehend the world

213
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,160
and think about the world the plan

214
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,860
of with with the world

215
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,089
automatics commodity actually useful

216
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:46,080
that term and that by virtue of

217
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,560
three in ourselves

218
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,989
from our habitual automata eyes process
these

219
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,209
we're able to look at ourselves

220
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,720
and the world

221
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,790
fresh ways

222
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,879
automata version

223
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,779
that's something we can talk about right

224
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:05,499
we don't quite know what out what some
body means we don't quite know what

225
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:06,399
nirvana means

226
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,300
when somebody says you do your comment
i'd

227
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,870
your mental process these

228
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,560
we know what that means because we've
got na we didn't in nineteen sixty six

229
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,790
we've got technical definition of what
part comet is asian means automatic

230
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,550
process these are inevitably a vote by
the appearance of some stimulus

231
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,119
they run incorrigible ego completion

232
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:31,269
they don't consume cognitive uh...
resources

233
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:35,020
and they don't interfere with other
kinds of things that are going on

234
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,399
so what's going on here it is is the
general ideas

235
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,709
that the in the ordinary course of
everyday living

236
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,750
or or of the reports

237
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,230
experiences

238
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,390
are actions

239
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,879
are overwhelmingly guided by these
habitual

240
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,589
processed sees that are engaged in
automatically and that by virtue of one

241
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,259
form or another of these meditative
disciplines whether vendor he'll go or

242
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,410
whatever

243
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,330
free ourselves from that

244
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,419
deal automata lies

245
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:06,540
experience

246
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,480
and action

247
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,089
so that we can approach

248
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:14,029
every new object every new event every
new experience and something that his

249
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:17,140
new

250
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,479
we know what automata zation means

251
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,980
date we have some idea about how to
measure it

252
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,740
let's see

253
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,530
what we can pardue

254
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,390
the question here really and it's a very
interesting one

255
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,730
once some

256
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,870
feature a mental life has been
automatons whether it's a vaguely

257
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,390
automatons like a reflex

258
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,170
or art or or onto automata eyes through
some kind of

259
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,890
or extensive mourning process

260
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,820
kenya unring the bell

261
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,859
can you order them somehow

262
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:48,180
i'll break that off

263
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,390
and return to what bug to appoint where
you were where your not

264
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,610
necessarily responding to these kinds of
mobile of habits

265
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,200
and again just to point out

266
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,910
with the government of the date of this
dichotomy

267
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,850
or all of this interest has its roots in
the nineteen sixties counterculture

268
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,120
movement

269
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,930
along and there was alone

270
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,140
well for the for example

271
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,260
a great deal of interest in the sixties

272
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,450
i'm sure there is a boost interest today

273
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,880
a great deal of interest in the sixties
and the use of psychedelic drugs of

274
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,950
various kinds

275
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,380
like l_s_d_

276
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,110
order resposta break off these habitual
patterns

277
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,139
and leave people

278
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:26,800
to have uh... have mystical mls
experiences

279
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,190
on various

280
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,110
veristrat

281
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,420
so nazi

282
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,009
exactly how we could figure out

283
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,360
what to do with this

284
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,139
first is

285
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:40,610
we got a couple of methodological
problems that have to be solved

286
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,400
yoga ends then are essentially religious

287
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,070
practices

288
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,749
okay

289
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:50,519
their they're prepared contemplative
practices ever embedded in our body of

290
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,680
religious belief

291
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,970
or at least some kind of deep

292
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,120
or that people are sitting

293
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,860
and if you want to study what what's
goin what what goes on these you really

294
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,010
auto find practitioners find real you
know he's working and subhash from

295
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,000
someplace

296
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,790
or real buddhist monks are working the
insolvable

297
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,270
insolvable monastery someplace

298
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,990
as soon as you start doing that

299
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,809
you've got all sorts of

300
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:17,830
well above all sorts of methanol

301
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,160
buffalo article problems

302
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,240
for example people select themselves for
entrance into these disciplines you

303
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,280
can't randomly assigned somebody to be a
yogi

304
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,290
on so you gotta worry about what these
people were white

305
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:30,870
before

306
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,280
they entered the are strong or the
monastery

307
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,240
all you don't know what they were like
before they get driv ers from where the

308
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,189
monastery typically

309
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:42,059
so you don't have any premeditated pays
for it

310
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,420
if you've if you want

311
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,180
uh... dept sons ambassador in new
testimony somehow when you find these do

312
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,260
you want alma prices fought

313
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,560
you don't really know where there is
always that way for him

314
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,460
or whether the actual meditative
tradition

315
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,250
produced some kind of change

316
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,090
and then finally public not not finally
there are problems though

317
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:07,260
volvo a kind of conflicting vocabularies
and uh... at that time that the other

318
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,990
things here

319
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,629
when duckman says

320
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:13,060
that the result of printed contemplation

321
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,640
is the deal automata zation of fought he
means one thing

322
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,810
when we talk about it in this class

323
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,889
what we mean is

324
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:22,160
bus trip test

325
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,140
or something very much like that

326
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,380
and the question is

327
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,800
is performance on something like the
strip test

328
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,260
uh... pan adequate

329
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:37,040
of the law about of the arc de or
compensation our hypothesis

330
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,250
you've got to deal with all the problems
of

331
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,440
at what stage the oppressed people do
expect novices who are meditating to

332
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,010
show the same effect says about weapons
experts

333
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:47,900
probably not

334
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,579
and then finally whenever we bring these
things into the laboratory

335
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:55,290
if we are going to kind of take people
off the street or take people out of the

336
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,930
college classroom in teach them to
meditate

337
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,179
all there's going to be a very broad
very alone

338
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:03,160
profound change

339
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,010
in the

340
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:08,790
sore rounding the socio cultural context
in which that takes

341
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,050
it's one thing

342
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,809
to doing yoga on a mountain top it off
her meds cottage

343
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:14,529
okay

344
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:17,520
it's another thing entirely to do yoga

345
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,200
forward maybe another thing entirely to
do yoga on your seventy five dollar

346
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,580
abercrombie unfit she'll go back in an
air-conditioned gymnasium

347
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,329
that's just

348
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:27,730
not necessarily

349
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,530
all of the same thing

350
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,100
on and you gotta make

351
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,699
you've gotten we've got to be clear

352
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,780
that there are going to be differences
here

353
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,440
palm

354
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,300
in any event

355
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,540
there is a trumka truce virtual that so
i have to tell you

356
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,670
i'm going to show you the high points
but there is a very much research on

357
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,050
those and i'll tell ya why

358
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,370
the reason why is

359
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,950
until very recently cognitive scientists
have been interested

360
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,250
right that the more interested in the
letter perception

361
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:56,839
palm

362
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:59,320
and the second thing is that

363
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,550
when these

364
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,940
when these meditative disciplines were
imported into the united states they

365
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,040
were imported largely as stress
reduction techniques

366
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,580
and because they were imported largely a
stress reduction techniques

367
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,940
the most scientific analyses are vara
fax

368
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,690
have focused on

369
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,290
physiology

370
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,740
the stress-free pa response order nomic
nervous system activity apart rate blood

371
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,680
pressure muscle tension stuff like that

372
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,320
all the indices which are interesting as
indices of relax ation and stress

373
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,260
reduction

374
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,980
but are not necessarily the best indices
around four

375
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,220
changes and consciousness

376
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,740
and attention so

377
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,200
so on that so that that's a real problem

378
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,960
that the research

379
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,670
that's been done signed some cases very
extensive research

380
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,609
hasn't focused on the kinds of cognitive
changes

381
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:52,950
federer of interest to us

382
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,180
or hear or escorts

383
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,840
you know their problem is

384
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,379
that or with one exception that's the
stroup house

385
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:03,500
government spend a lot of time of the
strippers

386
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,800
there has been

387
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,300
on general failure vault for people to
use consist of assessments for one

388
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,130
laboratory to another

389
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,089
or one laboratory will use the d_-two
test of attentional deployment

390
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,639
onto to look at the effects of
meditation

391
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:23,020
another one will use a all haha object
perception test or off

392
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,789
counting tester something like that

393
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:27,000
there's a lot active standardization

394
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,959
that prevents

395
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,090
pause from comparing results from one
study to another even within a

396
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,340
laboratory

397
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,539
much less from one study to another

398
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:37,700
or across laboratories

399
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,030
we do the best we can

400
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,330
what god all of this interest going

401
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:49,530
were two studies in the nineteen sixties
that were extremely provocative

402
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,940
all of that and made use

403
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,710
on measures of dvd nosers although
attention

404
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,320
are specially twelve with respect to the
alpha rhythm null and reduce the

405
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,900
operative before the context of uh...

406
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,450
in the context of that is the show and
uh...

407
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,950
and sleep

408
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:06,340
palm

409
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,130
and we know that all as you will fall
asleep

410
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,390
first alf activity increases as you're
relaxing and then it goes away

411
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,840
uh... we know that elf activity has
increased when your eyes are closed when

412
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,330
over as opposed when your eyes are open

413
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,530
we know that when your eyes are open alf
activity has increased to be just going

414
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,840
to be focus your eyes and you're not
looking to do anything in particular as

415
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,570
opposed to looking at

416
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,920
uh... its own particular old object

417
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,460
on

418
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,670
the very earliest

419
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,620
scientific studies of meditation

420
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,790
made use of augie j measurements to try
to figure out what's going on in their

421
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,250
heads of people who were meditating

422
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,780
and they looked basically ad

423
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,740
three different of phenomenal

424
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,930
what is known as alpha density

425
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,950
which as its name implies

426
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,019
simply represents

427
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:58,960
this year amount of elf activity in the
g

428
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,259
as opposed to

429
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:04,710
beta activity or delta activity or or
whatever

430
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,470
the second

431
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:09,190
phenomenon is what's known as el for
blocking

432
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,870
which occurs as a or e_m_t_ response to
a novel stimulus

433
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,550
if you've got somebody sitting in a rule
when you've got the eleven the g

434
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,060
electrodes on their heads and their gov
got their eyes open and they're really

435
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,270
not focused on too much to generate a
fair amount of alpha activities

436
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,450
but as soon as you play some kind of
sharp lawyers are introduced any kind of

437
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,710
novel stimulus

438
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,350
what will happen

439
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:38,150
this alf activity nice sinusoidal elf
activity will quickly be blocked

440
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:43,020
fuck and replaced by on the by beta
activity this much bastardy synchronized

441
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,040
activity

442
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,690
that's known as powerful blocking that
sale or e into response to a novel

443
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,300
stimulus

444
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,190
but character you play

445
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,359
that stimulus over and over again

446
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:57,450
what happens is you get habituation i'll
be alpha block in response

447
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,789
with repeated

448
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:03,390
stimulation over trials you wronged you
don't uh... you don't see the awful

449
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,299
blocking anymore

450
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:05,590
the awful blockages

451
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:12,570
that the elf activity just remains more
or less constant

452
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:18,080
is very increased alf activity during
meditation yes

453
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,089
unfortunately a lot of that is an
artifact

454
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:24,320
but the fact that many meditate urs
medicaid with arise caucus

455
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,320
which just naturally increases alf
activity just can't help but you're a

456
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,310
warrior

457
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,190
that have a lot of alpha activity

458
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,880
well your eyes are closed

459
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,520
and even if their eyes are open

460
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,700
or they're often engaged in this

461
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,460
behavior of the kind of not looking

462
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,580
or or d focusing

463
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:46,020
uh... we used to think that at the high
levels of alf activity in the g work

464
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,750
characteristic of the meditative state

465
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,280
we now know that's not

466
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,899
that you can see high levels of elf
activity all in all sorts hopeful

467
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:56,990
it all sorts of mental state

468
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,210
so it's the justices so ciation there

469
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,230
you do see high levels of elf activity
in meditation

470
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,260
it's just not unique

471
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,690
premeditation

472
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:07,769
so what else

473
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,220
can you look at

474
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,030
here is a very early study note the date
nineteen sixty one by unarmed and his

475
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,910
associates psychologists and on in india

476
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,160
on of the practitioners of raggio growth

477
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,999
these were very very very dept

478
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:25,309
practitioners they've been added for a
long time

479
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:28,110
and the really interesting thing

480
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,820
of apostle awesome trainees

481
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,379
the really interesting thing about raj
yoga

482
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:36,860
is that the goal of the meditative
disciplines

483
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,270
is to be called the whole bolivia still
the world

484
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,700
oblivious both too

485
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,289
external stimuli like voices and and
uh... and events in the environment and

486
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:48,920
also what would be a state internal
stimuli

487
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,730
like your stoma grumbling as it
approaches uh... at that as it

488
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,020
approaches

489
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,230
sold one another's colleagues did was
kawaii drop a couple of all in all of

490
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,350
the experience the oldies

491
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,150
all and and also some yogi said training

492
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,350
and all

493
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,950
and lenin look at their e_e_g_ elf
activity

494
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,980
they discovered

495
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,310
yes there was an increase in the density
of elf activity while these guys were

496
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,190
engaged in their yoga on uh...
meditation

497
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,590
the second a much more interesting thing

498
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,450
is that these yogi is especially the
experienced you know he's

499
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,790
did not show the powerful block in
response to a novel stimulants

500
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,580
brothers of the interesting for two
reasons

501
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,470
alpha blocking is and

502
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,760
innate response you don't have to learn
it it just happens the same way that

503
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,390
the patellar reflex just happens

504
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,510
but these guys

505
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,859
palm uh... show ante up

506
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:51,110
anne blocking for the stimulus

507
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,059
it appeared that

508
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:54,310
in fact they were

509
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,850
achieving

510
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,770
the state

511
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:00,740
that is the point of raja yoga which is
a state of all bolivia's snows to

512
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,580
external stimulation it's as if

513
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,359
those novel sounds

514
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:08,280
just didn't get in or at all

515
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,330
they didn't have bitch way to the
blocking because they didn't block

516
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:17,060
are there just wasn't anything uh...
their role

517
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,080
very early paper very primitive data
presentation would be really have to

518
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,230
take their word for it they kind of
showed some of their grabs

519
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,980
all but that's basically what the report

520
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,460
home okay

521
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,770
alf activity

522
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:33,560
behaved as it should be hehe

523
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,640
given what these guides were trying to
do

524
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,820
they're trying to become oblivious to
the external world

525
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,320
and they or oblivious to the external
world as measured by

526
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,220
fail your of the alpha blocking

527
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,730
responsible for

528
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,390
right about the same time

529
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:55,049
to japanese psychologist casa matsu
emicare right did a centrally the same

530
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:57,960
experiment with zen practitioners

531
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,550
users and masters and disciples

532
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:04,410
undoing their sitting order that the
city meditation

533
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,940
and again they measured apology health
activity in the gene here's a look

534
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,620
actually photograph of the guy sitting
in the yard

535
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,460
well it would be no

536
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,700
meditation room with their electrodes
attached

537
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,360
and first thing they found

538
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,070
was that there was

539
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,759
on again

540
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,330
a large amount of elf activity generated
while these guys medicated

541
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,280
even though they were medicating but
their eyes open activity that usually

542
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,970
diminishes the amount of althorp

543
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,810
these zen meditate or is

544
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:42,140
in contrast to the yogi uses embedded
peters didn't show blocking to the

545
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,360
stimulus

546
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,710
which is interesting

547
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,350
what's even more interesting

548
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,940
was at the zen meditate or as showed no
habituation

549
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,270
yell for flocking

550
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,040
and again

551
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,669
the whole point exam meditation

552
00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:02,190
is to experience each new event c_n_n_
obv itself without relating it to

553
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,830
anything else without seeing all that's
the same old hand clap that's the same

554
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,830
old bill that's the same or whatever

555
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,290
appear

556
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,820
to be doing that

557
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,720
or they're not showing

558
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,080
all automatic alpha blocking

559
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,540
called for

560
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,799
uh... the they're showing the awful
blocking stimulus

561
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,110
other thoughtful block into the stimulus
that's automatic

562
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,440
but this habit uation processes also
automatic

563
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,220
the bowl of their medication

564
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,649
is to experience each event

565
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:31,110
new for itself

566
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,980
and that appears to be doing what
they're doing

567
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,980
uh... physiologically as well

568
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,600
and then finally casa matsu in her right
ought not observed

569
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,640
with very experienced meditate urs

570
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,210
you got even though slower alpha
activity

571
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,779
like data activity

572
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,230
on especially towards the end of the at
st

573
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,289
but it's a difference between zen and
yoga

574
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:52,810
of uh... practitioners

575
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,919
with respect to alpha blocking

576
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,169
and the habituation of alpha blocking

577
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:58,890
that's really interesting

578
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,640
you cannot imagine the amount of
interest or closer to his phenomenon

579
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,050
uh... in the nineteen sixties

580
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,850
are young

581
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:12,440
i chased a very famous that master all
over my college campus

582
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,300
so the several months trying to get him
to let me put electrodes on his head

583
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,500
and he was very nice about it

584
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,090
very nicely

585
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,450
but he was very nice

586
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,000
uh... he kept saying that would

587
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,490
what would it be

588
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,110
buffeted name

589
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,670
and i actually think

590
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,750
crashing think if you have got the
invite them masters something that was

591
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,810
what we will call when

592
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,450
you know what would it mean

593
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,610
palm total or what

594
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,430
one day at one day he could turn to be
said

595
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:46,220
if the pope or hear would you put
electrodes on and wiley said mass i said

596
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,520
now is that why not

597
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,350
i don't have a good answer for that and
because i didn't have a good answer for

598
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:58,900
that party eventually went away

599
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,710
the interesting thing about all of this
this is just more of their date again

600
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:06,470
very primitive data presentation on here

601
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,609
is that ok

602
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:10,330
dorgan's and if you come param

603
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,200
differences between you know guns n of

604
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,019
uh... that are that are reflected in
this song path

605
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:19,719
in this performance in yoga you get no
blocking to the stimulus

606
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:22,510
exam the blocking dawson habitually

607
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,120
only one problem

608
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,830
never been replicated

609
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:31,540
or herbert benson and all our item
dollars arthur shapiro abdullah at

610
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,080
harvard very taken with the study

611
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,310
basic repeated this study with a large
number of practitioners of zen

612
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,779
meditation

613
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:44,380
standard raggio got and also
transcendental meditation which is off

614
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,670
of derivative

615
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,400
although they just got nothing

616
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,860
they got no shall we call 'em doc
triangle

617
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,480
no doctrinal differences

618
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,100
all all these guys

619
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,860
or showed alpa blockade as expected

620
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,549
and all of them showed

621
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:00,399
habituation

622
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,300
of the alpha blocking

623
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,900
as a as expected so that's just one of
these

624
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,700
brings that kind of seats in the
literature that bags that you

625
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,450
a new route would really like to see it
again

626
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,520
but the reason i talk about the unarmed
experiment and the casa months when her

627
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,580
rights for women

628
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,590
even though

629
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,940
that becca ringe other shapiro palm

630
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,320
of were were thrown unable to log

631
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:24,779
replicated

632
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,740
is it a gives you the idea

633
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,420
of how you might go about scene

634
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,780
meditation really has the kinds of facts

635
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,940
it's supposed to have

636
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,580
all yours a more recent serve it does
work well ya rolling david presley a

637
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,340
lecturer at the uh... blog

638
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:43,990
department

639
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,399
with all booboo with buddhist or the
medicator zazzle

640
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:49,149
much more extensive study

641
00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:53,269
uh... that the other one was these are
seventy-six that monks with lots of

642
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,580
training

643
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,430
calm

644
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,240
and all of the actually compared

645
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,400
of that

646
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,229
practitioners of two different forms of
meditation

647
00:29:02,229 --> 00:29:05,039
compassion meditation which is
characteristic of buddhist

648
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,560
or that the baton

649
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,419
that buddhism

650
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:10,019
of the

651
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:13,279
the traditional one point meditation
which is characteristic

652
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,380
of zen meditation

653
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:20,850
and what they did was to employ a
phenomenon known as binoculars rivalry

654
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,789
and what happened

655
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:24,190
you probably don't know about this when
i was very cool

656
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,250
all prominent visual all of the visual
cognition

657
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,390
what you do is to present to different
images one do you try

658
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,840
so for example

659
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,750
all stimulus with a horizontal grady
like this

660
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,830
and a stimulus with a all vertical
gradient all like this

661
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,640
and when you do that to ordinary people
people like ours

662
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,830
what the person experiences

663
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,419
binoculars rivalry

664
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,679
the proof that you want to get one
percent right because what's happened

665
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:52,480
what's supposed to happen

666
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,570
images cast on the revenues of the two
wiser

667
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,710
all later on in the off

668
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,670
individual system

669
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,380
but it turns out that for uh... that
though

670
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,870
do that

671
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,000
called sold out

672
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,360
when you present

673
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,290
horizontal grateful left aryan the home

674
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:14,690
vertical grade to the right i what you
see is a alternation

675
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,190
between the two stimuli

676
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:21,649
but not it turns out if you're an
experienced tibetan buddhist meditate or

677
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:23,330
okay very nice

678
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,210
all here is the amount

679
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,249
all vault

680
00:30:26,249 --> 00:30:29,540
of the the number of subjects
experiencing binoculars

681
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,240
all rivalry

682
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,630
and what you see here is that

683
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,430
especially

684
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,270
while the subjects are meditating

685
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,380
it's very reduced

686
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,430
and even after the subjects of finished
meditating

687
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,419
on itself

688
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:46,890
it's very reduced sort of the rate of

689
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,110
thought but the rape of rivalry the rate
which

690
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,590
with which the images

691
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,170
shift back and forth

692
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,010
very much slowdown

693
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,450
and that suggests that

694
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,130
they really are cable to pay attention
to one

695
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,749
as opposed to the other they're not
subject to this kind of

696
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:04,100
almost reflex like

697
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,190
all rivalry phenomenon

698
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,370
fascinated experiment

699
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,430
all that i know on uh... doctor prestige
is uh...

700
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,049
that has been following up

701
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:14,510
over the last

702
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,610
last year

703
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,290
a great deal of the research on the
effects of meditation

704
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,380
all have laws that have flowed

705
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,370
not from studies of you know he's like
don't wanna like the anon the study that

706
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,620
i just showed you

707
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,950
of people who are practitioner you what
you might call

708
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,980
secularized and become modified version

709
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,580
of yoga meditation

710
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,060
either the transit double meditation
promoted worldwide

711
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,529
by called such figures as the maharishi
on mahesh yogi

712
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,090
still got a partial dot on

713
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,610
uh... telegraph avenue

714
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,919
or all we within our power the medical
context by

715
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,450
all of the so-called relax ation
response that was sold

716
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,100
pioneered by herbert benson

717
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,860
like harvard university

718
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,140
basically what bentsen did was to take

719
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,039
maharishi scores

720
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,370
dog

721
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:10,509
uh... what whereas in t_m_ you get your
own mantra to focus on

722
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:13,800
during your yoga exercises during a
previous exercises

723
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,260
fence and gives everybody the same

724
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,030
mantra

725
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,039
the word one

726
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,990
called and odos span in the basement of
the same thing

727
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,139
but the idea is

728
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:30,590
but resin double meditation is
essentially a translation

729
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,159
techniques

730
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,669
kind of strip double law called the
religious harder than context

731
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:37,480
on not entirely

732
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,670
ulm and all the time to relax ation
responses completely secularized it's go

733
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,010
that

734
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,040
it sold for two people

735
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,149
halt who have cardiovascular problems
for example

736
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:49,960
as a stress reduction

737
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,460
here are the martin

738
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,380
see this for yourself

739
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,010
later on

740
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,100
basically fences

741
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,650
instructions

742
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,669
for the real excision response

743
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:06,340
and the question is what kinds of faxes
do this kind of meditation

744
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,240
or have

745
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,220
and again

746
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,710
here it is where

747
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,150
within the transit double meditation
community for example the t_m_ community

748
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:13,999
has been

749
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:17,989
very very very good about doing research
the document the effects of

750
00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:19,330
transcendental meditation

751
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,529
they published several volumes

752
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:24,230
all volvo research

753
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,640
almost all of it

754
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,239
for has focused on

755
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,160
you autonomic nervous system

756
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,700
and other indices of relax ation

757
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,960
hardly any of it

758
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,080
has some

759
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,210
of the pope has focused on

760
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,889
one example what one counter example

761
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:42,929
home here

762
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:45,680
is a pioneering study by art

763
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,840
patrols alexander skit alexander

764
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,900
or who was the uh...

765
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,570
after he got his

766
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,090
the hood doctor bri from harvard became
the chairman of the psychology

767
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,310
department at maharishi international
university

768
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,950
on and uh... alexander of wagar inside

769
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,100
their colleagues

770
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,350
on basically

771
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,509
on forty m to the residence elderly
retin residents of a deal

772
00:34:08,509 --> 00:34:10,460
of a retirement home

773
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,629
called and then called and tried to
measure the effects of the practice of

774
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:16,019
transcendental meditation

775
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:17,630
on a wide variety

776
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,809
of cognitive tasks

777
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:22,629
unit one i want to talk about

778
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:24,780
stroop interference because

779
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,059
strength interference is the gold
standard of automata city

780
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:32,489
of where the whole idea of automata city
came from

781
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:33,709
you can't help

782
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:36,620
but read the word when you're trying to
name the color

783
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,889
of the ink in which the word is printed

784
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:40,750
and that the reading of the word

785
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,829
gets in the way

786
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:42,449
volvo

787
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,059
of the color name

788
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:45,729
and what they did was to compare

789
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:49,759
a bunch of all the residents who had
gone through it uh... uh... transit over

790
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:50,959
meditation course

791
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:55,520
another group of residents would gone
through not the cold that'll mindfulness

792
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,979
of the training

793
00:34:56,979 --> 00:35:00,919
all of that was attended would tend to
be kind of a a placebo control

794
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:03,190
here or subjects were just want to

795
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,969
relaxed

796
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:06,619
and control subjects who didn't want to
get anything

797
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:10,489
there was a reduction instru pinter
appearance

798
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:12,609
uh... in the yucky i'm of group

799
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:16,169
but it was not statistically significant

800
00:35:16,169 --> 00:35:16,869
didn't make it

801
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:18,339
for the kind of thing work

802
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:21,309
they've just one maybe fifteen or twenty
more subjects that might have had no

803
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:23,759
power to detect

804
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:25,630
but you can see the idea here

805
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,590
that present double meditation

806
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,980
at least there's a trend here for
reducing most group

807
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,079
float the strip interference

808
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:35,680
all here's another study done on uh...

809
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,609
a little bit later this a bike lady
winks or madison suite or doctoral

810
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:41,769
dissertation at yale university

811
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:46,599
and what dole blanks farm as did was to
pickled or group of

812
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,190
college students basically

813
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,300
and give them one passed through

814
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,500
a fifteen minute long

815
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,609
reading

816
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,569
meditation

817
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:58,189
exercise in which there is simply
supposed to focus on their breeding

818
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:58,810
for

819
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,229
for fifteen minutes

820
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:04,079
this is a centrally what we now know as
mindfulness meditation all talk about

821
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:04,779
that

822
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:07,159
in more detail

823
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,939
but among the arm

824
00:36:08,939 --> 00:36:10,890
among the many tasks that

825
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:15,579
that uh...

826
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:17,049
wank home

827
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:21,819
she was wank than she is downplaying
storm as o winkle administered to her

828
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:23,740
subjects was a strip task

829
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,880
she measured stroop interference before
and after

830
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,900
or the meditation exercise

831
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,139
and also had a control condition in
which subjects

832
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:34,059
just uh... just rested

833
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:35,760
and what you can see here appears

834
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,119
thus a standard way of doing the home

835
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,789
the the strippers

836
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:42,630
there's a baseline religious reading
color patches

837
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,889
that this may mean color patches

838
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:46,069
then there is a

839
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:50,640
congruent ask where there's a word and
the word is the same as god culver in

840
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,349
which it's printed so it's the word blue
printed in blue image

841
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:55,130
and then there is

842
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,539
the a critical

843
00:36:56,539 --> 00:36:59,629
incongruity condition

844
00:36:59,629 --> 00:37:02,969
the name of the word of the color of the
uconn which it's printed

845
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:07,169
is uh... different and what subject just
posted it was simply maine the color of

846
00:37:07,169 --> 00:37:08,159
the work

847
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,689
member stroop interference

848
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:11,799
interference with

849
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:13,439
name of the word

850
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,390
the um...

851
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,400
with the color navy

852
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,339
and what you think this is pretest
before anybody

853
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:21,090
all they've got any meditation

854
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,500
and you can see here

855
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,949
very nice stroop interference effects

856
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:29,469
indian congruent condition of takes you
a lot more eager to made the colors

857
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:31,159
that in the baseline

858
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:32,580
the congress condition

859
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,680
the republican four groups who don't
have to go into details

860
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,309
there are also showing stroop
interference

861
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:41,679
on the post test

862
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,630
what dog

863
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,759
what what what what i found to make a
long story short

864
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:49,739
on is reduced stroop interference but
there was still stroop interference

865
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:51,620
there just wasn't as much

866
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,239
as there was before

867
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,859
and there was more change

868
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:58,039
more reduction in stroop interference in
the meditation group

869
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:59,070
then there was

870
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,259
in the argument to control groups

871
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:04,779
or passes back in

872
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:05,769
kind of see this

873
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:09,279
so for the meditation group incongruity
condition

874
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:10,709
stroop interference starts out

875
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,449
the pretest about

876
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:14,050
on seven hundred milliseconds

877
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,829
the name of color

878
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:19,200
and drops down to or five hundred
seventy five

879
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,579
that's a pretty substantial

880
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:24,049
home so here

881
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:26,640
brought this has change in stroop
interference

882
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,599
and you can see that there's much more
of a reduction in stroop interference in

883
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:37,599
the meditation group than the reason the
other two groups yes

884
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:44,649
ads just that's just our it's an
accident

885
00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:49,919
are because in fact in the in the wake
study archie randomly assigned subjects

886
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:53,229
the conditions that i just turned out
that way

887
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:57,249
so there are there are these baseline
problems it's not easy

888
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:58,989
that the other

889
00:38:58,989 --> 00:38:59,999
to do this

890
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:04,409
all but the thing at the the thing here
is to really think about

891
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:05,499
if you just kind of

892
00:39:05,499 --> 00:39:06,280
take each

893
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,369
group against its own baseline

894
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:09,540
you can see that there's

895
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,549
how much greater reduction

896
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,119
called for the meditation group

897
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,339
that's a problem

898
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,439
but it's not critical to the
interpretation of the experiment that

899
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,679
something you would like not to happen

900
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,939
you'd think with random assignment
everybody would start out equal

901
00:39:23,939 --> 00:39:25,069
there are

902
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:26,979
failures of random ization

903
00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:32,779
along the way it doesn't always work out
the way you'd like to work out

904
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:36,269
and you've got a turn in your doctoral
dissertation sometime so you can't keep

905
00:39:36,269 --> 00:39:37,589
doing this

906
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:40,759
uh... in order to get it

907
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:41,689
absolute right

908
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:42,460
so

909
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:47,079
here's another condition she added
cellmark dad some of them some controls

910
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:49,080
again you can see on the pretest

911
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,759
ochoa quite a bit of stroop interference
and all the groups

912
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:55,269
now here

913
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:57,940
they look very comparable

914
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,509
and in the post test

915
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:01,599
yeah out there is some reduction here

916
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,399
and what you can see is that

917
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:06,250
in the meditation of the group

918
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,910
there is an actual reduction in stroop
interference

919
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,010
whereas

920
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,579
learning control group for the rest to
control group

921
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:17,029
there's a change

922
00:40:17,029 --> 00:40:18,219
it's not a reduction

923
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:20,039
so again what

924
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:24,719
all twinks form as a study seems to
suggest that alexander's did not was

925
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,420
that at least with respect to the
breeding form of meditation

926
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,249
that uh... that she uh... uh...

927
00:40:32,249 --> 00:40:33,780
but she started

928
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,660
meditation does seem to lead to deal
automatons ation of thought as measured

929
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:44,839
by the stroup at uh... that's that
that's what we're going to focus on

930
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:47,039
out uh... just to

931
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:49,039
just to

932
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:52,489
clarified that you had some other
measures as well she asked people to

933
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:55,839
categorize objects that you found that
after meditation

934
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,599
people

935
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,520
were more

936
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,940
easily able to it

937
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,769
categorize on usual objects

938
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:04,029
and so on

939
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:06,109
i'd you pointed out here

940
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:07,730
as opposed to

941
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,019
real yoga meditation

942
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:14,279
or perhaps even transit double
meditation there's some debate in the

943
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:17,780
literature about whether to young counts
as a religious

944
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,409
organization

945
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,000
or not

946
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,390
i want to get into that fight

947
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,420
for one thing we know for sure

948
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,470
is that

949
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,999
armed thugs

950
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:27,689
do you know

951
00:41:27,689 --> 00:41:32,089
the the procedure used by weighing storm
as was completely secular

952
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:35,690
argues for college students randomly
assigned to these conditions

953
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,599
there was no nothing alike

954
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,159
or religious or philosophical overweight

955
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,640
uh... yet she got the use of she got
these really alone

956
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,630
interesting kind of a fax

957
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:53,439
recently there's been a spate of
interest in the yet another

958
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:58,009
secularized and to some extent from
modified version meditation

959
00:41:58,009 --> 00:42:02,789
all known as mindfulness based rests on
the stress reduction

960
00:42:02,789 --> 00:42:04,690
then all the buddhism

961
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,139
present origins long ago and far away

962
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:10,940
began to come to the attention of

963
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,290
people in the in america in eighteen
ninety three when the person's and

964
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,130
masters

965
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:19,769
or came to the united states offer this
big conference call world parliament of

966
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:20,670
religion

967
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,439
think about that for a second

968
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:25,269
sounds great

969
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:25,790
alm

970
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:31,490
and then our and that in the fifties on
board i said to that susan t uh... who

971
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:37,859
was a very paul prominent on a teacher
or bob or those of buddhism in japan not

972
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,619
exactly a zen priest itself

973
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:44,230
so we did study was at least came in
baidoa good middle lecture tor

974
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,360
of the united states and got abt a lot
of people

975
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:47,760
especially

976
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,789
the people of the beat generation

977
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:54,890
jack carol lack alan ginsberg william
burroughs all those guys who spent a lot

978
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,190
of time down in

979
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,299
eggs or

980
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:02,459
all vonnegut got dot god doug got
intrigue lives and meditation by virtue

981
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:03,700
of the lectures

982
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,799
di substances okie

983
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:10,409
and more recently john cabot zeran who's
all medical psychologist at university

984
00:43:10,409 --> 00:43:12,699
of massachusetts medical school

985
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:14,269
or has developed

986
00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:17,080
all of the basically based on his own
buddhism

987
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,410
what he calls a mindfulness based stress
reduction technique

988
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,210
which does four is then buddhism

989
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:28,420
what herbert benson is relaxing should
response did for yoga

990
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,060
take it completely out

991
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,869
of its religious and philosophical
couple of them context

992
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:35,710
and teach it to people

993
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,569
as essentially of stress reduction
technique

994
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:40,299
which is why it's called

995
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:43,359
mindful of the space

996
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,369
most of the stress reduction

997
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:50,160
also what we've got here is the
secularized all of the buddhist practice

998
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,219
some people are taught

999
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:54,940
ought to the trained too

1000
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,119
hong engage with their world of what

1001
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,479
cabins in cold

1002
00:43:58,479 --> 00:43:59,710
mormon from moment

1003
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,390
non judgmental awareness

1004
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,610
that's a cloud

1005
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,600
over to clone

1006
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,210
now that's a nice cloud or it's a fluffy
cloud or insult rain cloud it's not

1007
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,119
quality

1008
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,330
you have a pain

1009
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,239
you just experience the pain

1010
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:17,969
and let it go with static thinking about
the meaning of the pain

1011
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:19,539
dot and so on

1012
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:23,099
and covered soonest colleagues have
developed a strong operational

1013
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:23,839
definition

1014
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,229
operational definition in psychology

1015
00:44:26,229 --> 00:44:28,419
defines a construct by the

1016
00:44:28,419 --> 00:44:29,039
procedures

1017
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:31,269
ployed

1018
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,669
all these people were taught to sit

1019
00:44:33,669 --> 00:44:34,069
alba

1020
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:36,140
you know meditative posture

1021
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,069
and focus on their role

1022
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:42,449
uh... plot only on the partly sensations
especially the the sensations of their

1023
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:44,159
breeding

1024
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,269
thoughts and feelings come into their
minds has posted just noticed some of

1025
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:50,239
them but the go winston welling

1026
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:52,779
dwelling on them return attention to
breathing

1027
00:44:52,779 --> 00:44:53,590
and then

1028
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,510
in addition to the formal training say a
couple of hours of the couple of one

1029
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:00,019
hour sessions a couple of times a week

1030
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:03,780
all of these individuals were given
homework assignments asked the practices

1031
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,809
right at home

1032
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:09,180
as well and so as well as in the clinic

1033
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:14,719
again palm called so agood this practice
is supposed to do two things

1034
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:18,739
evolved in a mindfulness pay stress
reduction as opposed to enhance the self

1035
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:20,430
regulation of the tensions with it

1036
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,360
your controlling

1037
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,949
uh... your attention

1038
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:26,359
all but also is supposed to

1039
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:28,900
or even reorient yourself to experience

1040
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,099
so that you were experiencing things but
not thinking about that

1041
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:37,239
or you're noticing things but not
judging

1042
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:40,219
all there is no

1043
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:42,329
psychologists have developed a
questionnaire to measure these things

1044
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:43,549
the toronto

1045
00:45:43,549 --> 00:45:44,669
mindfulness kale

1046
00:45:44,669 --> 00:45:47,150
uh... was developed to measure are

1047
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,119
people's responses to

1048
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,419
uh... mindfulness based meditation
techniques

1049
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:56,179
on this kayla soft on the lecture
supplements for this course of your

1050
00:45:56,179 --> 00:45:56,589
date's been

1051
00:45:56,589 --> 00:45:59,039
uh... kind of meditative practice at all

1052
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:01,009
you might want to

1053
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:04,689
fill it out after your next uh... at
your next session

1054
00:46:04,689 --> 00:46:05,850
and then there's this

1055
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,560
wife acid mindfulness scale which is
more of a personality questionnaire

1056
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,449
which measures

1057
00:46:10,449 --> 00:46:12,299
how wine before you are

1058
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:15,369
of things in the ordinary course of
everyday living

1059
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:17,689
to what extent can you just not react

1060
00:46:17,689 --> 00:46:21,099
to what's going on in your on your mind

1061
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:25,280
and uh... and so on this saw scale is
also up on the lecture supplements

1062
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,490
if you want to

1063
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,690
if you want to fill it out

1064
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:31,119
ads with transcendental meditation

1065
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,519
most of the studies of mindfulness based
stress reduction

1066
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:36,299
as its name suggests

1067
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:37,640
have focused on

1068
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,270
measures of stress

1069
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:41,389
anxiety depression

1070
00:46:41,389 --> 00:46:43,660
measures of audit nomic nervous system
function

1071
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,880
like heart rate

1072
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,130
and uh...

1073
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:48,059
mccarty of ordered from cardiovascular

1074
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:49,009
are measures

1075
00:46:49,009 --> 00:46:51,589
but there are a couple of calm

1076
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:53,889
there were a couple of oliver attempts

1077
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:54,760
to look at

1078
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,269
the effects of and bsr

1079
00:46:57,269 --> 00:47:01,409
mindfulness

1080
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:02,550
cognitive processing

1081
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,699
using our old friend the strip test

1082
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:06,489
on

1083
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:10,779
here's a word he resolved with early
boasts of study by by anderson and her

1084
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:11,999
colleagues

1085
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,489
measuring

1086
00:47:13,489 --> 00:47:18,509
the affects called mindfulness based
ross reduction on emotion

1087
00:47:18,509 --> 00:47:24,130
lots of nice changes more positive
affect less negative affect

1088
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,269
she got nothin when she tried the
strippers

1089
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:31,319
home they're just no changes in st coast
performance at all

1090
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:34,579
unfortunately the strip test that you
use it was kind of all weird variant of

1091
00:47:34,579 --> 00:47:36,199
the stroop test

1092
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:37,449
soul

1093
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:39,680
more in malad ascii

1094
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,139
pretty much the same on

1095
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:43,059
the uh... the same experiment

1096
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:47,419
looking at

1097
00:47:47,419 --> 00:47:50,579
of all although mindfulness pay stress
reduction

1098
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:52,640
on stroup past performance

1099
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,229
and what you can see here

1100
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:57,329
small effects

1101
00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:01,039
so this is the number of items you
process okayed the number of colors you

1102
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:02,380
can name

1103
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,179
less interference were colors you can
name

1104
00:48:05,179 --> 00:48:05,860
and

1105
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:12,170
completing a six-week course of them bsr
produced a signal significant increase

1106
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,499
poem color navy performance

1107
00:48:14,499 --> 00:48:19,129
and a significant looks swollen it is
but it's a certain alone statistically

1108
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:19,729
significant

1109
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:22,139
of decrease endeavors

1110
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:23,829
so here again we have

1111
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:24,869
or somebody

1112
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,549
are showing

1113
00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:28,750
the effects of the automatons ation

1114
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,920
coming from bsr

1115
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,039
here all

1116
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:33,499
i gotta say

1117
00:48:33,499 --> 00:48:34,970
that's a small effect

1118
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:36,150
and just to kind of

1119
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,979
show ya how small it is

1120
00:48:38,979 --> 00:48:39,869
here is

1121
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:45,400
a study by amir roslan cognitive
neuroscientist at mcgill university

1122
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,909
for using our hypnotic suggestion

1123
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:49,020
for all

1124
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,540
ag knows you know or maybe alexia

1125
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,289
looking at the effects of that on the
strip clubs

1126
00:48:54,289 --> 00:48:55,179
on here

1127
00:48:55,179 --> 00:48:57,049
on twenty twenty basically

1128
00:48:57,049 --> 00:48:58,939
gave highly of the faisal subjects

1129
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:02,899
a suggestion that whenever they saw
these words would be jim burge to them

1130
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:09,329
looked like words of a foreign language
but they didn't understand

1131
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:12,059
in the control condition

1132
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:14,079
when the suggestions not given

1133
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,319
highly hypnotize ipl subjects show very
nice troop interference

1134
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:19,609
when the planet

1135
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:22,890
been given a suggestion that the words
are jabber ish like in a foreign

1136
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,129
language

1137
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:26,909
strip interferences eliminated
completely

1138
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:30,489
or really

1139
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:32,249
since these are in susceptible subjects

1140
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:33,150
they show

1141
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:35,830
all stroop interference in the control
condition

1142
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:38,810
they don't respond to the suggestion
this they continued to show of strength

1143
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:39,979
for the poor

1144
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:44,189
so stroke interference is something that
can be abolished completely

1145
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,440
in just a couple of

1146
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,160
although they've been just a couple of
minutes fight all appropriate

1147
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,689
suggestions the high we cut the price of
all subjects

1148
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:53,359
six or eight weeks

1149
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,079
fault meditation experience

1150
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:57,109
and bsr experience anyway

1151
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:58,730
i could have some

1152
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,860
affects diminishing stroop interference

1153
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,860
but doesn't do anything like

1154
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,989
abolish it

1155
00:50:03,989 --> 00:50:05,009
why that is

1156
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:06,059
we don't know

1157
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:09,119
further research is required to try to
figure this out

1158
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,049
but i suspect the reason they has
something to do with the fact

1159
00:50:12,049 --> 00:50:16,159
that and bsr is really focused on stress

1160
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:17,420
and emotion

1161
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,599
the autonomic nervous system

1162
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,860
and not so much

1163
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:25,009
on these on cognitive changes of your
compensation

1164
00:50:25,009 --> 00:50:26,259
still not all

1165
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:29,790
the idea that as far as consciousness is
concerned

1166
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:32,449
meditation are supposed to change
consciousness

1167
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:36,389
three nos from automatic habitual
patterns of thought

1168
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:38,930
we have ways of measuring this

1169
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,549
in science

1170
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:42,789
in psychology and cognitive science

1171
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,120
so what scientific approach

1172
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,430
premeditation is going to look at that

1173
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:48,369
measures

1174
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:54,409
the automata zation whether it's a
stroop task or something else

1175
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:58,079
we've talked a lot of discourse about
what consciousness is and how we can

1176
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,879
approach of scientifically

1177
00:50:59,879 --> 00:51:02,349
next week we'll finish off by talking
about

1178
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:05,319
where consciousness comes from

1179
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:06,140
thank you very much

1180
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,119
we'll see you have a good weekend
