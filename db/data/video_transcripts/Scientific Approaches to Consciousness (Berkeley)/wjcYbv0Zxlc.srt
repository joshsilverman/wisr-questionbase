1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:03,740
okay let's

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,569
pick up where we left off last time

3
00:00:08,569 --> 00:00:10,740
and just reviewed of debating a bit

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,859
let's just

5
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:13,629
talk about what we did

6
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:18,000
last week

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,729
the general

8
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:22,650
identification of consciousness with
attention

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,269
lead psychologists or early on could be
interested in the various

10
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,979
forms that attention conflict in the
various process easy that on july

11
00:00:31,979 --> 00:00:35,670
paying attention to something shifting
your attention to something to goering

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,980
something and so what

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,440
that led to an interest and how much
processing could take place at outside

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,729
all the focal attention

15
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:49,560
which is to say what the scope of pre
attentive or pre conscious processing is

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,049
that's led to the debate over between

17
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:56,179
fault early stage processing theories of
attention and waits a bit late selection

18
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:58,200
theories mobile of attention

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,930
which never got resolved

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,269
which led to people like daniel carmen

21
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:06,659
to propose that in fact i was a false
distinction and that we had to take that

22
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,770
we would we had to have carries

23
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,340
but take into account two different
kinds of processing

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,530
automatic processing

25
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,640
which doesn't consume attentional
capacity

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,610
and controlled processing

27
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,120
and where we left ourselves last
wednesday was with albans allergic obeys

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,320
processed association procedure

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,770
which uses what's known as the method of
opposition to estimate

30
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,860
how much follow

31
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,100
perforce how much of the performance of
any given task

32
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,890
is due to

33
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,759
unconscious automatic processing

34
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,110
and how much of past performance is due
to conscious controlled processing

35
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,690
that in turn led to the

36
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,369
elaboration

37
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,370
of a large number of water known as dual
process theories and psychology

38
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,829
the whole volume of these edited by
shelley che continue our cultural

39
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,120
or pauline on nineteen ninety nine

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,100
and a more recent take on this dual
process business

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,770
by elliot smith

42
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,809
and don't get me to call stir

43
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,579
but in general

44
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:13,650
the idea behind all these dual process
theories

45
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,759
is a performance on any task

46
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:21,399
remembering a phone number all vasc in
somebody to marry you bein toothpaste in

47
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:25,579
the drugstore choosing your classes
whatever it is that you're going to do

48
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,639
is performed by some combination

49
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,639
ald all volvo automatic and controlled
processing

50
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,840
as some of these dual process there is
put it

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,390
you basically have a choice in terms of
how you're going to do something you can

52
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,520
either go the automatic route

53
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,979
or you can go the control group

54
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,510
and character blow-dried frog very nice
paper by smith and the koster

55
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,980
or as a kind of general

56
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,989
characterization of what these two
different kinds of prostheses are alike

57
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,029
there are conscious

58
00:02:57,029 --> 00:03:00,999
prophecies sometimes called effort for
prophesies are controlled prophecies

59
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:05,939
that are mediated by all symbolically
represented rules that is rules that are

60
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:09,040
somehow represented talking in language

61
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,999
home

62
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:14,550
and dog these aught conscious or ref
report control processes

63
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,439
are the kinds of things that are luring

64
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,089
single trial or just one trial

65
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:24,690
if all i see you're going near a
dangerous electrical socket they say

66
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,119
don't do that

67
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:26,909
you avoid it

68
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,389
you just stay away from it right

69
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:33,229
palm so that's that's something that's
under conscious control processes

70
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:34,799
and the general idea here

71
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,660
is that

72
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,470
taken a conscious room towards past
performance

73
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,329
is something that's on your our control
it's optional

74
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,900
we do it depending on

75
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,020
how much information processing
capacities available to us we do it

76
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,239
depending on our level of motivation but
the general idea is that on his effort

77
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,040
fuller controlled processing

78
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,959
all of the audit is conscious

79
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,200
in the sense that

80
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,769
your consciously aware called the steps
in the process

81
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:06,899
your consciously aware of how you get
from your starting point point eight

82
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:08,210
two-year goal point

83
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,669
all point b

84
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,450
and that's to be contrasted

85
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,370
with these processes that are performed
automatically or unconsciously

86
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,940
or smith and a koster suggest that these
are mediated by more cars so see the

87
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,809
kinds of uh... principles

88
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:27,220
the kind of thing that you might find it
and all of the dog traditional

89
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,999
all accounts of classical oradour
instrumental conditioning

90
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:34,570
all of these uh... or associate
relations are structured by

91
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,349
the similarity between

92
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:41,759
to things or the spacey o temporal kandi
geary all of the between two things

93
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,629
and they're the kinds of prophesies are
required over many trials if i don't

94
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:47,759
tell you anything about the electrical
outlet

95
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,199
they'll go over and you'll stick your
finger in it and you'll get shocked

96
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,249
and yelled go away and then you're kinda
move back towards the electrical outlet

97
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:57,809
daniel stick your finger in it and
you'll get rocket

98
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:59,580
pretty soon you'll come to associate

99
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,170
the electrical outlet was something very
painful and it won't go over there

100
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,159
anymore

101
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:08,509
and the general idea is that these all
associa process these are executed

102
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,290
automatically

103
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,690
all pre consciously

104
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,860
so that you're not or where of how
you're getting from point a to point b

105
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,070
all you're aware of is that directly
beat

106
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,710
okay that's the general idea behind all
of these kinds of things

107
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,479
now the relevance of this

108
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,169
is one lead up to on but when we move
away from

109
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,009
although analyses all cognitive
functions like perception memory and

110
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:38,240
thought processes and categorization and
all that and get into

111
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,569
something closer to a social behavior in
the real world

112
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:45,849
all and ordered or we're going to talk
today about how

113
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:49,589
this distinction between automatic and
control processes

114
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,759
has been carried over from cognitive
psychology and cognitive science

115
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,989
into social psychology and other kinds
of social sciences

116
00:05:57,989 --> 00:06:00,710
and as a backdrop let me just fell apart

117
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,460
no summarize very very very briefly are
the traditional cognitive perspective in

118
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,710
social psychology

119
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,159
which basically says

120
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:13,169
that social interaction is cognitively
mediated

121
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:15,860
that is how we interact with each other

122
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,470
is determined by our perception of the
other person

123
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,120
by the goals that we have for the
interaction by the way we explain the

124
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,319
events that occur in the in that
interaction by memories of

125
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:32,919
past interactions with that person and
similar kinds of people

126
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,800
all-weather were engaged in

127
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,679
social interaction were not just trying
to

128
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:41,219
impressions of other people which is
what person perception is all about

129
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:43,300
but we're also trying to

130
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,169
control

131
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,639
how old they perceive oz

132
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,779
and then all of this is gone at least

133
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,870
the implication of traditional

134
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,800
on cognitive values and social of
direction is at all this is mediated by

135
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,469
conscious deliberate thought

136
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:02,239
on that what i need somebody for the
first time i'm consciously trying to

137
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:05,469
figure out what he or she is like and
i'm trying to control what he or she

138
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:09,210
thinks of me at all that kind of stuff

139
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,639
that traditional cognitive focus in
social interaction carried us along way

140
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,520
in social psychology

141
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,689
bob over and over the overtime

142
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:22,510
some resistance to it began to build up
resistance that really took the form

143
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,640
of too

144
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,159
different

145
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,349
on the different jack shins

146
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:27,949
one

147
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,319
they were both involved the kind of

148
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,970
reaction to this kind of pulled the

149
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,909
calculating

150
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,659
overly irrational view

151
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,659
of social interaction

152
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:41,050
all of the the idea that word of the
hallways than ever

153
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,350
call it the whole that everywhere trying
to perform some kind of rational cost

154
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,830
benefits calculation

155
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,099
or with with with everything we do and
some social psychologist began to make a

156
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:52,080
plea for

157
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,809
what they sometimes called hot cognition

158
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,560
uh... that is to say

159
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,569
that part of the very least our
cognitive processes are infused with

160
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:03,120
warm when wet stuff

161
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,720
are with the emotion that motivation
that all of that we have drives at once

162
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,259
and

163
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,389
needs them

164
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,520
feelings and affects

165
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,119
and that they're important the social
interaction

166
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,120
called the two

167
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,479
and one way they are important is that

168
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:22,269
are cognitions leave on for happy
weekend to see everything as positive

169
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:26,449
all week and remember positive things
and so one all and so forth

170
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:30,549
the other reaction to this cold
calculated rational view was more

171
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:31,269
relevant

172
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,650
art we're going to talk about alarm

173
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,840
in this course

174
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,759
and that is

175
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:41,360
the end but beyond that embraced by some
social psychologist all of this concept

176
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,620
although of autumn aka city

177
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,290
traditional social psychology

178
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,819
tends to focus on

179
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,129
the rule of the situation

180
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,149
in armed constraining or controlling

181
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:57,270
what people think and do in various
situations

182
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,950
and all of the uh... the uh... the the
the proponents of the sort of a custody

183
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,120
argument

184
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,029
basically argue

185
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,480
that these situational constraints
situational control operates

186
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,230
automatically

187
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,339
we're not aware

188
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:11,509
of the influence of the situation

189
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:16,529
on our thoughts and behavior and the
general model for this although i don't

190
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,739
like the idea of situational influenced

191
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:20,630
whose primary

192
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,209
something happens in the environment

193
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,050
and that corrine and so forth

194
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,930
and then that thought leads us

195
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,310
to act in a very busy and not you know
that they're in various ways

196
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,290
and what happened very quickly

197
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,070
as social psychology

198
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,120
in quality imported from cognitive
psychology the notion of autumn

199
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,449
intensity all some social although
psychologist

200
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,509
of the came to the idea

201
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:47,510
that art that's a fact of the matter was
that most social behavior

202
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,050
far from being deliberate then conscious
that voluntary in nature

203
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,439
is really automatic in nature most
social behavior

204
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:56,660
or personal

205
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,620
occurs automatically on their really
quite serious about this

206
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,339
this is our job barge bennett and why
you and i would be able to spend a we're

207
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,280
all in this group of people who are
making this argument

208
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,460
or writing in nineteen eighty four

209
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,950
all very lovely essay discovered great
pension for wonderful titles

210
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,610
on the automata city of everyday life

211
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,489
skinner argued so pointedly

212
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:25,030
the more we know about the situational
causes of psychological phenomenon

213
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,840
the lesson need we have

214
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,100
for postulated internal conscious

215
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,120
mediating

216
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,499
prophecies

217
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:33,780
to explain these phenomena

218
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,620
now they are a couple of things are
really interesting about the statement

219
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,620
the first is

220
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,020
we had a cognitive revolution in
psychology we found in cognitive sides

221
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,530
to get away from b_f_ skinner

222
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,770
onto all of the disrupt and and and and
through one of the defeat

223
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,470
behavior risen in psychology

224
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,300
and put the mind of back and i are at
the uh...

225
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,670
at the center of things

226
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,520
yet here's a guy who says he asked her
how to write the first time

227
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,350
are that the these are conscious guard
on cognitive processing really don't

228
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,160
have much to do with anything

229
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,650
you don't have to talk about internal

230
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,590
internal

231
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,480
conscious

232
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
mediating processes

233
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,249
are barges are cognitive social
psychologist

234
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:19,379
he says he s killer was wrong in that he
douglas can or didn't think that you had

235
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,689
to think about internal processes

236
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,790
mediating between stimulus and response

237
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,490
but otherwise he had it right

238
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,780
node none of those internal processes
are excessive bolta conscious awareness

239
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,150
they are all occur

240
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,200
consciously

241
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,030
leading

242
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,079
origin other people

243
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,959
to make a strong claim that social
behavior is essentially automatic in

244
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:42,660
nature

245
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,269
that what we think what we do

246
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:46,690
how we perceive

247
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,350
how we explain things

248
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,330
and how we act upon those cognitions

249
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,010
all is basically triggered all by the
environment

250
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:00,290
alm is a product of pre attentive or pre
conscious processing we have no idea

251
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,340
what's going on inside our heads

252
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,210
all of that that gets is from stimulus
on to respond

253
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,339
on yes

254
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:10,680
alm social behavior is guided by

255
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,670
internal

256
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,210
cognitive another mental representations
that's

257
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,310
standard

258
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,800
doctoring for cognitive social
psychology

259
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,340
but far disclaim that all these internal
but all representations of the situation

260
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,510
or constructed automatically

261
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,910
and then they're just kind of dumped
into awareness

262
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,920
all of the are basically the idea here
is that

263
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,709
on everything occurs

264
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:36,310
unconsciously

265
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,130
uh... one without any kind of conscious
mediation

266
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,220
now how do you get to that position when
you get to that position through

267
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,680
experiments like this

268
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,510
this is a classic experiment

269
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,150
by barge in the stall the colleagues

270
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,199
organ which

271
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:52,089
subjects were brought into the
laboratory

272
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,720
all for an expert meant a final language
processing

273
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,950
uh... that was the cover story social
psychologists are famous for concocting

274
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,180
sort of cover stories onto in an attempt
to prevent

275
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,030
of their subjects for almost all of them
figured out what's really going on for

276
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,540
successful that is as a matter of
controversy

277
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,339
all but i what type of my life

278
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,430
still have very very very close friend

279
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,060
identifies himself both as a cognitive
and social psychologist

280
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,399
and he once applied

281
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,889
one was interviewed for a job in social
psychology and he gave us talk about

282
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:29,740
memory and other information processing
of all this kind of stuff

283
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,680
and the first question that that is job
talk was what makes you a social

284
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,340
psychologist

285
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,700
and his answer was

286
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,310
i log into my subjects

287
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,589
have that's a little harsh

288
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:44,200
though it's not on true

289
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,670
but there's a budget tremendous nielsen
social psychology of deception and cover

290
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,310
stories and stuff like this in

291
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,890
recruiting subjects for a young

292
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,250
for a uh...

293
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,420
other experiment on language processing
was part of the experimental deception

294
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,500
so what does subjects task was they were
given a bunch of

295
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,190
word while the old were although no
words on finals

296
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,800
although they were scrambled

297
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,539
and they were supposed to

298
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:12,489
unscramble these words so was to make
complete sentences and there was an

299
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:14,480
experimental rooster there with a
stopwatch

300
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,540
but im along it took them to do these
kinds of

301
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,960
some of the sentences contain the words
that barge cold ruling primes

302
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,730
words like aggressively and rude and
bother in disturbing intrude which all

303
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,230
bear on the concept

304
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,340
of rudeness

305
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,959
other sentences

306
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,900
scrambled senses contain words that
barge calls

307
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,390
polite crimes

308
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:43,150
fall or words like respect and honor
inconsiderate and appreciate and all of

309
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,370
the holiday and patiently

310
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,890
all of which are related to the concept
of

311
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,720
politeness

312
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,830
and then there were neutral tribes what
would primes like exercising for most of

313
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,990
the cage italy

314
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,370
which are relevant neither to rudeness

315
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,670
politeness

316
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:04,029
so some subjects unscramble bunch of
senses that andrew crimes

317
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,709
other subjects on scrambled sentences
that had a bunch of polite crimes and

318
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,029
then there's a control group

319
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:13,160
that on scrambled sentences that had of
what should be snook brutal crimes and

320
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,760
you get the idea and that's all the task
what's

321
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,270
at the added obvious ferment

322
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,840
palm beyond

323
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,240
uh... the the subject was going to be
our page were given our booth is

324
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,800
experimental participation credits or
whatever it was

325
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,980
but the subject came out of the rome

326
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,240
and uh... the expert letter is possibly
dealing with was engaged in conversation

327
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,459
with another person who was

328
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:40,330
in fact a confederate of the
experimenter is part of the staging

329
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,640
of this experiment

330
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,400
and the experimenter

331
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,860
assiduously ignored the subject

332
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,120
who joins had to wait there

333
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,900
is payment

334
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,950
that's not polite just not

335
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,710
very flight

336
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,250
and actually built the b_ above the
script

337
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,250
called for the experimenter to
steadfastly ignore the subject

338
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,810
for ten minutes

339
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,349
just imagine for a second

340
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:08,779
if you're waiting for somebody for ten
minutes before they do what they're

341
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,200
supposed to go

342
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,620
you would be tempted to interrupt them

343
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,600
might take hate

344
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,730
give me a minute here give me my payment
and then you can go back your

345
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,440
conversation

346
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,989
well that was in fact the purpose of the
experiment

347
00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:24,990
was the time how long the subjects in
each of these preconditions

348
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,190
would wait before interrupting the
experimenter

349
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,569
and the finding was

350
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:30,940
that subjects

351
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,060
the interruptions and sperm are over a
period of ten minutes

352
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,450
subjects on the plate condition

353
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,120
relatively or unlikely to interrupt the
expert matter

354
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,489
subjects

355
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:44,990
who unscramble senses containing rude
words

356
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,690
we're very unlikely to interrupt the
experimenter and subjects

357
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,520
who won scrambled sentences with neutral
words

358
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,540
phil alden

359
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,180
fell somewhere in between

360
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,720
the general idea here buga building on
the barges interpretation of the six

361
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,000
permit

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,710
just redeemer ruling words

363
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,920
prime do

364
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,350
think rules thoughts and gage in rude
behaviors

365
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,360
or maybe as an alternative

366
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,929
draws to remain broad words

367
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:16,300
prime due to precede the experimenter

368
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,770
as more rude then

369
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,150
otherwise would have been percy

370
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,040
similarly

371
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,459
just really

372
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,439
words related to politeness

373
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:31,120
makes if you came in a polite way or
interpret somebody's evolve of the

374
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,760
people somebody else's behavior as if
not exactly polite

375
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,070
at least not quite as rude as you might
have done otherwise and the argument is

376
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,600
that all of this happens unconsciously

377
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,200
after all subjects were instructed to
make the connection between the words on

378
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,460
the other event and the uh... behavior
of the experimenter

379
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,420
there was nothing about that the
experiment

380
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,940
it was just a thought on that would be
made barges solved view

381
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,580
this all happened automatically

382
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,760
re-enroll words you'd be calmer rude
person

383
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,470
reimer woodward's you interpret somebody
else's behavior as rude at all happens

384
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,720
automatically

385
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,659
all and uh... on consciously

386
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:15,659
without any kind of on without any kind
of intention

387
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,000
you never know what the baseline is for
something like this that's a good

388
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,730
question

389
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,059
the important point is

390
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:28,420
that the neutral guys are in the middle

391
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,210
and also these guys arlo

392
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,880
right there really are likely

393
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,190
these guys are high

394
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:40,260
now it's about fifty percent this kind
of in the middle

395
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,030
in these guys which permits you can
always

396
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,289
push the values around

397
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,779
a little bit but you would expect some
kind of work to read like this and

398
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:47,660
that's

399
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,340
that's what you get

400
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,770
that's all i can say

401
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,740
not my experiment

402
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,559
um...

403
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,910
so hard to so what what what what what
what god john barge does his so i look

404
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,379
all yes

405
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:03,929
aqua beginners controlled by the
situation then yes the kind of

406
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:06,590
psychologists are right that are
behaviors actually cool controlled by

407
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,750
the perception of the situation

408
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:14,650
but the perception of the situation is
itself constructed pre consciously

409
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,390
automatically

410
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,990
without any conscious mediating
processes in terms of

411
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,610
injury

412
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,100
ought all those kinds of situational
effects that you read about yen-dollar

413
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,010
in the uh... the uh... experimental
social psychology literature what the

414
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,460
bill burr mix permit

415
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,770
all of those all occur all automatically

416
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,040
social perceptions are perception of
other people as friendly your hostel or

417
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,520
whatever that's all constructed
automatically on

418
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,070
going from perception to behavior

419
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,460
proceeding somebody s hostile and
treating him as if he were hostile

420
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,240
that happens automatically

421
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,410
of valuating people as blue dart
battered by use or on nice

422
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,370
on that happens automatically

423
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,020
getting from a valuation behavior all
that happens automatically

424
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,990
on his metaphor is it social behavior
doesn't involve social cognition

425
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,320
so much as it involves social

426
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,540
ignition

427
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,570
there's a stimulus out there that
ignites things that primes something in

428
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,110
your mind and about and behavior has
kind of takes off

429
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,500
home from that

430
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,140
all barge expanded his view although a
little bit later

431
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,430
all people said well yeah that's all
true but still when people enter into a

432
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,380
social situation they have certain kinds
of goals that they want to all

433
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,850
part of the deal within those at least
or conscious

434
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,560
and parts is now that's not conscious
either

435
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,600
on he produces what he calls them

436
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,279
auto motive model for social behavior
where again the traditional way we think

437
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:43,480
that we thought about on social
interaction

438
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,770
when you come into a spin into a social
situation you have something you intend

439
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,780
to do

440
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,190
and your conscious of that

441
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,360
and then you are that now and then doll

442
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,849
maybe your configure your consciously
formulate your intentions

443
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:59,119
and maybe your behaviors automatically
executed on the basis of those

444
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,570
intentions but at least the intentions
themselves are consciously although

445
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,160
formulated

446
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,440
but no from his point of view

447
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,809
goals and motives are also automatically
invoke

448
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:13,009
it's automatic from beginning to and

449
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,559
and consciousness please

450
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,230
knoll role

451
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,500
and social behavior

452
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,950
on vault

453
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,380
alm actually that's not true

454
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,940
jon burge was once asked to give a young

455
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,029
than estimate

456
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:27,980
of how lol automatic social behavior was
and he said

457
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,850
ninety-nine

458
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,020
and forty four

459
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,270
one hundreds percent

460
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:38,460
people of a certain age will recognize
that phrase from ivory soap edsall lebow

461
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,400
told me you know

462
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,750
on nineteen sixties eighteen seventies

463
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,850
uh... but uh...

464
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,160
that's basically are the general idea

465
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,490
now this i'd this idea caught on

466
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,479
all producing what

467
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:54,860
i've called the autumn it has to be
juggernaut on in social psychology

468
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,450
a group of theorists

469
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,170
all michael dot about uh... john barge

470
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,580
who argue that human social behavior

471
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,580
is largely automatic in nature

472
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,210
that harper steps of the situation

473
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:12,059
or conscious perception of the situation
or relevant our conscience goals are

474
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:15,880
relevant to our conscious of motions are
relevant the whole shamir

475
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,270
is their relevance

476
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,890
because all of our

477
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:19,600
fought

478
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,140
and feelings and desires and behaviors

479
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,649
or alone apart over triggered

480
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:27,420
by a pre conscious

481
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,040
or analysis of the situation that takes
place automatically

482
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,629
outside conscious awareness

483
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:35,080
and conscious control

484
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,980
the implication here is a consciousness
is an afterthought

485
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,539
there is a stimulus

486
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,840
and we respond to would automatically

487
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,370
and only after we respond would
automatically do we give our reason for

488
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,120
the way we behave

489
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,360
and that reason has nothing to do with
why we actually behaved this weekend

490
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,580
know why we actually behaved

491
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,590
because not one of the pathway from
stimulus to response is completely

492
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,560
automatic an unconscious

493
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,549
when we give reasons for our behavior

494
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:08,380
what we're really doing is giving
plausible or acceptable reasons

495
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,469
for our behavior

496
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:12,820
but those reasons are entirely
orthogonal

497
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,690
the real reasons which are embedded

498
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,960
in these

499
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,830
automatic

500
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,220
called the processes abroad that that
are applied

501
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,040
uh... applied unconsciously

502
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,909
on to put it on put another way

503
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:28,380
in fact were all zombies after all

504
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,179
palm

505
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:33,730
and it's not bald before over all of the
four of the the usual kind of reasons if

506
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,270
you remember for your reading about
proponent of a dent bennett's of

507
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,430
orb response was on the argument

508
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,080
then it's a lot of argues

509
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,690
you can have an unconscious is i'll be

510
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,770
because of your physiologically
identical to humans and you've got

511
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:48,990
consciousness

512
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,760
all

513
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,610
so all of the world zombies after all
but it's not because were all big them

514
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,940
not because on these are conscious too

515
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,050
all of the the implication is here they
were all zombies after all

516
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:05,550
because in fact consciousness is at the
phenomenal

517
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,059
consciousness plays no causal role

518
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:09,270
all in

519
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,220
behavior and the proof of that

520
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,810
comes from experiments like

521
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,770
the xvi experimenter interruption
experiment

522
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:16,809
that shows

523
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:21,970
that babies affects of the situation on
behavior seem to be mediated

524
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,970
by unconscious home

525
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,110
called unconscious processes

526
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:32,110
okay so there we are also the more we
know about the situation will causes of

527
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,359
psychological phenomenon

528
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,979
the less need we have for pasta leading
internal conscious mediating processes

529
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:39,649
to explain these phenomena

530
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:40,980
and then barge goes on

531
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,180
is right in the nineteen ninety-seven
here

532
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,270
all of the making the forecast that

533
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,010
as knowledge progresses

534
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:51,029
there will be less of a role played by
free will were conscious choice in

535
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,700
accounting

536
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,570
for these psychological phenomenal and
then give so it's kind of this

537
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,530
kind of orwellian voice here

538
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,100
this trend has already begun

539
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,850
and it can do nothing but continue right

540
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,290
has kind of oracle about supplement

541
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,980
about psychology

542
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,550
and they're not all in the end of the
later on the same paper

543
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,000
all the business section public is
consciousness right into the sunset

544
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,600
or electricity pervades everyday life

545
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,030
i am statically push the point where she
writes this i emphatically push the

546
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,460
point

547
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,849
that automatic non conscious prostheses
purveyed all aspects of mental and

548
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:30,170
social life

549
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,559
all and he does that

550
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,269
in order to overcome

551
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:37,740
what i consider the dominant on even
implicit assumptions to the contrary

552
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,100
concedes so it's it's forcibly

553
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,780
alban

554
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,980
logon contradicting

555
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,800
this traditional view

556
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,900
are conscious uh... conscious that
conscious thought

557
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,400
all plays a role behavior

558
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,480
for those of you who are fans of all

559
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,500
uh... postwar czechoslovakian cinema

560
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,760
alone there is this

561
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,390
for the paper

562
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,820
the unbearable automata city of being

563
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,960
which kind of middle makes that makes
the same point most of a person persons

564
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,310
everyday life is determined not by their
conscious intention to deliver choices

565
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,480
but by mental processes

566
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,260
put in the motion

567
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,640
put into motion

568
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,240
by features of the environment

569
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,910
that operate outside conscious awareness
and guide so this is off this

570
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,330
preventable point of view here

571
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,120
that argues that

572
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,020
all social interaction

573
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,170
automatic including the social cognition
plays a role in social interaction

574
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,340
homes and conscious mental processes

575
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,720
really have nothing to do

576
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,870
with the case

577
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,400
now of course we've been here before

578
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,340
and barges quite aware of the heart of
the above the history of this plane

579
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,960
and he has explicitly put himself

580
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,179
are involve ought to be there in the
wind of what he calls

581
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,090
the progressive and naturalization

582
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,920
of alone of uh... logo of our
understanding of human nature

583
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,690
all this comes from all of the passage
in freud sun nineteen fifteen on new

584
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,860
introductory lectures or independence i
got up and sorry introductory

585
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,640
lectures and psychoanalysis

586
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,159
in which perot aide says

587
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:16,380
i'm here with what regret to tell you
something about use yourself

588
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,590
that you do not want to know

589
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,840
and i'm not the first person to say that

590
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,330
copernicus

591
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,649
told us dot all the broader showed us

592
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:29,299
that rear were not the center of the
universe

593
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:30,010
darwin

594
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,370
showed us that we were just another
animal

595
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,510
and

596
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,869
darwin thought we were a rational
animals

597
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:39,480
but i'm here to tell you

598
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,140
that we are irrational animals after all
of the recent gotten point said this was

599
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,610
because he had this idea that our
behavior was driven by these monsters

600
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,970
from the irs these unconscious

601
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,980
all sexual and aggressive or impulses

602
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,130
barge says

603
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,840
and that's not what's wrong traffic

604
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,809
barr says i'm here to complete

605
00:27:58,809 --> 00:27:59,850
the trio

606
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,460
of naturalization this cooper nicholas
darwin n me

607
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,080
all and i'm here to tell you

608
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,580
that part of the social behavior is
automatic after all

609
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,970
that we who only think that conscious

610
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:18,620
thought plays a role in our behavior
were quite wrong about that

611
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,870
all our behavior

612
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:25,850
or at least ninety-nine and forty four
one hundreds percent of that on islam

613
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:29,580
is what the is automatic and on colleges
as i say

614
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,340
john call this the autumn intensely drug
or not because he is not the only guy

615
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,820
who thinks that's

616
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,230
palm uh... there's not there's now a
whole school

617
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,110
all social psychologists and other
social theorist

618
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,210
who have embraced

619
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:49,190
this view and the question is why would
you embrace this view

620
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,940
okay

621
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,200
let's go back here for a second

622
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,330
experiments of this kind

623
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,660
let's just assume

624
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,660
for one

625
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,640
for the vote for the purposes of
argument

626
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,500
barges interpretation of this palm of
this so that experiment or write that

627
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,750
somehow reedy words conceptually related
to rudeness

628
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,529
okay

629
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:13,150
lead people to behave in a rude way

630
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,640
water matically

631
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,300
and that reading

632
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,679
words conceptually related to play this

633
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:22,130
lead people to behave politely

634
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,780
failed a this is an automatically

635
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,130
no problem

636
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,920
just accept that for purposes of
argument

637
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,080
nothing about this experiment or any
other experiment in this line of

638
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,400
research shows that automatic
unconscious prostheses dominate behavior

639
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,249
much less

640
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:45,270
that they account for ninety nine ten
forty four one hundreds percent

641
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:50,010
all our behavior all experiment like
this shows you is that

642
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:54,270
certain things happen automatically
right automatic process these might play

643
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,269
some role

644
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:56,919
uh... in this behavior

645
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:02,330
nothing about this particular experiment
on tells us that automatic prostheses

646
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,799
dominate conscious

647
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:04,810
control processes

648
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,710
for that you need an entirely different
kind of experiment

649
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:12,530
and that's why i introduced you last
time for marriage a colby's method of

650
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,309
opposition

651
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:17,310
and is processed association procedure

652
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,760
setting aside the mechanics of the are
those of the mathematics which i would

653
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,890
never hold you responsible for

654
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,660
the whole idea all

655
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,860
the process dissociation procedure

656
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,840
is first

657
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,220
performance of every task

658
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,940
composed

659
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,610
every test is composed of

660
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,419
certain components that are performed
automatically

661
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,130
and certain components that are
performed

662
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,190
consciously

663
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:46,170
deliberately and that we can use the
auto the method of opposition

664
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,420
in the process dissociation procedure

665
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,790
to estimate

666
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,820
how much

667
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,880
of past performance is doing to
automatic process ease and how much of

668
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,760
past performance is due to control
processes

669
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,950
nothing like that

670
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:03,419
appears in this experiment or in any l
other experiments these can be followed

671
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:05,010
only as

672
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,780
demonstration experiments

673
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,839
demonstration experiments that suggest

674
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:12,220
that automata city plays a role and
social behavior

675
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,720
but do not by any means

676
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,200
how much of a role for that we're going
to need something else

677
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,640
we're going to need experiments

678
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,600
that actually use something like the
method of opposition

679
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,230
to do these estimates

680
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,630
there are three such experiments of the
social psychological literature west

681
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,240
time i worked which was

682
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,520
yesterday

683
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,640
their experiments are very revealing

684
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,550
called makes use of a phenomenon known
as the false fame a fact law officially

685
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,970
dogwood discovered by larry jacoby

686
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,740
all an experiment in which

687
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,670
subjects abreast to study a list of non
famous names just

688
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:56,260
names out of the phone book that don't
or dark the names of anybody famous

689
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,220
and all of them later on they're given
all of that will fit in judgment as to

690
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,980
which they're presented with another
list of names

691
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,110
i'm simply asking check off which ones
they think are famous and which ones

692
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,350
they think about that

693
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,179
customers

694
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:11,170
consists of

695
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,840
some famous names

696
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,919
and also some non famous names

697
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:18,590
and some of these none famously famous
names like a ronald reagan and margaret

698
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,559
thatcher

699
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:22,190
and then some other on don famous names

700
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,370
and some of the non tennis names were
non famous name studied twenty four

701
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,919
hours earlier

702
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,770
and the general finding here which is
why it's called the false benefactor is

703
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,429
that previously studied nonna famous
names

704
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:37,500
tend to be judged as

705
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,330
and the idea of their is

706
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,000
there when you read

707
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,430
non-fat do remain

708
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,980
that you remember

709
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:51,000
from before it would be certainty that
name seems familiar it must be famous

710
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,150
and the idea is that that paul g that
name seems familiar is mediated by a

711
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,370
kind of conscious of the mediator by
kinda primate effect

712
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:02,360
that operates on consciously and creates
this kind of conscious feeling called

713
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,760
bob dole familiarity

714
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,379
so the general idea behind the poll same
effect is that

715
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:08,659
the study the stunning phase

716
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:10,660
primes names on a judgment ask

717
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,900
and a private increases availability and
availability in and availability of

718
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,480
drugs to retrieval

719
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,830
and availability and influences on the
famed judgment

720
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,410
and that all of that happens
automatically

721
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,970
so now what you really want to know is

722
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,830
when you get wet when you get this poll
sabretech

723
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:32,150
hollow much of the fall same effect is
due to

724
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,220
controlled conscious processing and how
much of this false famous effect is to

725
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,349
do

726
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,090
uncontrolled automatic

727
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,240
unconscious processing

728
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,400
we won't go through the details cause

729
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,240
you'd rather put a fork in your ride and
see the details of these experiments

730
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,880
all but called here is the author is the
general result

731
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,510
all walked off you know this is by drew
colby himself

732
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,330
all be repeated the false fame
experiment

733
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,019
all under

734
00:33:58,019 --> 00:33:59,580
dot three conditions

735
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,240
first young subjects performing a task
under full attention that was all they

736
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,370
had to do

737
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,230
was make fame judgments

738
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,049
second condition

739
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:11,369
for bomb-making fame judgments under
divided

740
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:14,899
attention also that they were actually
performing two tasks at once what was

741
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:19,479
the famed of the the pain judgment asked
one was a dance of destructor task that

742
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:25,579
was intended to consume to consume some
cognitive capacity and then on his

743
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:27,710
beaver studies of college students

744
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,999
then there was a group of the elderly

745
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:33,050
and we know from the study that i showed
your earlier

746
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,759
that elderly subjects tend to lose
cognitive capacities they get older

747
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:40,179
i've become more reliant on automatic
processes

748
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,699
what we've got here

749
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,149
is an estimate

750
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:45,499
all of the amount of initial ones

751
00:34:45,499 --> 00:34:48,639
of controlled an automatic processing

752
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,470
on the false fail affect

753
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,809
in each of these three conditions

754
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:54,470
the first five years

755
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,500
under the the standard condition were
also objects are doing is making fame

756
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,180
judgments that stuff

757
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,689
full intention condition

758
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:03,220
conscious processes

759
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,339
dominate

760
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:08,710
unconscious automatic processes okay so
even that's not automatic

761
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,520
now

762
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,330
in a second condition where you consumed
cognitive capacity by engaging subjects

763
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:19,169
in a distract ur task while they're
making the famed judgments

764
00:35:19,169 --> 00:35:21,159
the role palm

765
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,299
conscious processing

766
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:24,769
diminished

767
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:27,040
but even under those circumstances

768
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,720
yeah automatic processing has a little
bit more important but that's not

769
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,529
anywhere near a ninety nine and forty
four one hundreds percent automatic

770
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:37,930
and with the elderly

771
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,590
you get a little bit more influence of
automatic processing but there's still

772
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,779
welfare amount of conscious processing

773
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:46,809
involved even when old folks

774
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:48,500
are engaged in

775
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,780
bikinis fame judgments but in the
standard condition

776
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,420
where the false fame affect was uh...
was initially discovered

777
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,910
conscious processes

778
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,889
dominate

779
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:00,069
automatic processing

780
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:01,930
okay it's not the case

781
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,720
that this that this problem of effect

782
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,670
is mediated holy

783
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,709
or even in large part

784
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:10,240
whitewater matter processing

785
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,360
conscious processing is still played a
role

786
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,979
what the subject sir during the six

787
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:15,410
i remember this name

788
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,940
i remember this name from somewhere
don't remember i don't know where it

789
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,959
came from but i remember from somewhere

790
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:21,960
it must be

791
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:28,960
more famous than these other names yet

792
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:32,740
i'd just give you a sample barge
experiment

793
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:38,489
the barges experiments go back to
nineteen eighty two

794
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:41,749
that's the end of that answer

795
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:42,339
palm

796
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:45,459
now here's another argued the here's
another experiment

797
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:49,439
all by jim young woman car and his
colleagues at uh... at n_y_u_ on what

798
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:51,370
are known as spontaneous solid

799
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:55,369
or that the uh... the trade home of
uh... descriptions

800
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:59,389
indifference berman for different simply
ask to study photographs of people they

801
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:00,529
don't know

802
00:37:00,529 --> 00:37:04,329
and each of these photographs is for his
sab paired with the behavioral

803
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:05,139
description

804
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,430
on here's a person

805
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,710
and he all in

806
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,009
wanted just remembered

807
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:14,310
here's another person and he uh... made
sandwiches and here's another person

808
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:20,579
and uh... on hwy of didn't understand
the t_v_ show or or whatever

809
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:21,589
later on

810
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:24,609
these saw that these subjects were
brought back to the laboratory

811
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,810
and they were shown a new set of
photographs and they were asked to make

812
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,799
trade judgments

813
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:31,839
of the personalities of the people
pictures and people do this you know you

814
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,909
look at somebody as a all that's a
friendly person and all that stuff

815
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:41,989
conscientious person or whatever you can
get people to do this because you do it

816
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:44,729
we're always doing that kind of thing

817
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:49,249
and what neelam unfounded deankl the
trend judgments were made with a mix of

818
00:37:49,249 --> 00:37:52,929
these of all the photos of the subjects
unseen two days previously a bunch of

819
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:54,719
new photos

820
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,819
and what the finding was

821
00:37:56,819 --> 00:38:00,529
when subjects made trade judgments of
the people in the old photos the photos

822
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:01,969
that they had studied

823
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:03,719
those stretch abuse shins

824
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:07,609
were made in line with the behaviors
that had been attached to the

825
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:09,379
photographs on the first day

826
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:11,400
and the interpretation of this was

827
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,930
well when the subject studied these
photographs on day one thing on pulled

828
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,420
the make trade attributions

829
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,399
they just did it automatically

830
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:23,090
they all hope of the they automatically
attach the behavior to the photograph

831
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,599
and then automatically mated inference

832
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,029
from the behavior to the corresponding
trait

833
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:32,439
the person didn't understand the daytime
television show must be stupid

834
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:36,140
all of the person although it didn't
study for exam

835
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,160
wasp bee

836
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,670
most lack conscientious notes or
something like that

837
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,339
and the general idea is

838
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:46,569
look at the read about the behaviors
primed irrelevant rates

839
00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:49,140
stored and all of those are stored in
memory

840
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,760
that prime in increases availability

841
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,190
and that available early

842
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,979
on increased availability influenced
rate judgments

843
00:38:55,979 --> 00:38:57,830
and that the whole thing is automatic

844
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,539
okay that's the general idea behind the
interpretation

845
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:07,890
of these spontaneous straight path
inferences that they occur automatically

846
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:08,709
you applied

847
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:10,509
the method of opposition

848
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:13,859
onto this kind of experiment again but
it's not going to the details that don't

849
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:17,209
have uh... or that i don't have a lot of
time to do this

850
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:24,209
but you know one of himself did this to
all the good tested is own hypothesis

851
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:29,839
i'm going to tell you had a minute

852
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,730
remember that the med jim kolbe is
method of opposition

853
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,550
allows us to argued to assess

854
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:40,579
the relative contributions of conscious
and all the matic processing

855
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:43,009
so testified

856
00:39:43,009 --> 00:39:45,829
probably not the right term all except
before a posting

857
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:48,609
it's consciously automatic processing

858
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:52,310
so we did we do this is spontaneous
trade in print six permit

859
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,019
all under two conditions

860
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:58,099
first were subject to make the trade
judgments and we really after

861
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:59,979
studied the pictures

862
00:39:59,979 --> 00:40:04,099
second twenty minutes after they study
the picture is giving time for conscious

863
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:06,009
memory to decay a little bit

864
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:06,810
and second

865
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,810
two days

866
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,919
after studying

867
00:40:08,919 --> 00:40:12,409
palm all of these so that these pictures
giving

868
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,549
memory blocks of time

869
00:40:14,549 --> 00:40:15,879
to evaporate

870
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:20,159
in the standard and in the immediate
condition

871
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:22,449
conscious processing

872
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:27,239
conscious processing dominates automatic
processing

873
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,589
twenty minutes later

874
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:30,920
there's a nice balance between

875
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,429
conscious and on conscious processing

876
00:40:33,429 --> 00:40:37,020
even two days later which is how you'll
amended the experiment

877
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,789
in the first place

878
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:42,479
i mean it's mostly noise

879
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:44,670
the ms these values are very low

880
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,859
but the fact of the matter is

881
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,889
ghar ka just processing and automatic
processing are roughly evenly balanced

882
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:55,309
so in this case as well it's not the
case

883
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:57,379
that spontaneous inferences

884
00:40:57,379 --> 00:41:01,149
despite his trait inferences are a
product of automatic unconscious

885
00:41:01,149 --> 00:41:04,359
processing their product of a mix of
conscious

886
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:08,170
and unconscious processing

887
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:08,999
last experiment

888
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:12,150
this is known as the weapon bias palm
hog

889
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,110
uh...

890
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:17,269
richly documented by uh...

891
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:18,339
by paying

892
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:19,969
in a series of experiments

893
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:22,660
bogdan actually with leverage in kobe

894
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:27,549
this is an experiment in which subjects
are shown photographs or scenes of a

895
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:29,379
person with some object

896
00:41:29,379 --> 00:41:33,420
and their ass simply to make a judgment
about whether the object is a weapon

897
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,309
for tool

898
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:36,540
i hadn't gone or a knife

899
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,119
versus or wrench or a screwdriver or
something

900
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,179
uh... like that

901
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:44,279
and the flying in the parking fine you
know what the defect

902
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:46,140
is that

903
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,549
these are white subjects

904
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:49,399
white subject

905
00:41:49,399 --> 00:41:52,980
who are primed with pictures of black or
white people

906
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,910
that affects their judgment

907
00:41:54,910 --> 00:42:00,309
if you're pretty cute they've white
subjects are primed with a

908
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,279
they're more likely to drugs with the
object is the weapon

909
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:06,930
if their pride with a white face they're
more likely to judge that the object is

910
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:07,780
the pool

911
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,929
and this is another unobtrusive index of
racial bias

912
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,870
okay that's carboplatin uh...

913
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,799
uh... what it is

914
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:17,220
also the general idea here is

915
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,589
that the that presentation of the face
primos

916
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:21,840
racial stereotypes

917
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,460
and the racial stereotypes prabhat all
of the prime related judgments and again

918
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,569
the the influence

919
00:42:27,569 --> 00:42:32,459
of the priming is automatic

920
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:33,490
pain himself

921
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,729
did the experiment

922
00:42:34,729 --> 00:42:39,469
using beyond using garden jacoby xo that
method of both

923
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:40,630
of opposition

924
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,349
and again we're looking at

925
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:44,690
type of processing

926
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,410
conscious versus unconscious

927
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,669
on the processing

928
00:42:47,669 --> 00:42:49,229
and what you can see here is

929
00:42:49,229 --> 00:42:50,939
in the standard condition

930
00:42:50,939 --> 00:42:55,159
when there is no deadline in judgment to
take as much time as you want to decide

931
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:59,829
whether something as a weapon or a tool

932
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:03,219
conscious control processing

933
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:05,030
dominates unconscious

934
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,239
automatic processing it is not the case

935
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:09,660
that the weapons of fact is mediated

936
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,109
holy

937
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:11,680
or even a large part

938
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,409
by automatic processing

939
00:43:13,409 --> 00:43:14,849
the only time

940
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:16,139
that you'll get

941
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:18,130
all automatic processing

942
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:22,110
dominating although uh... odd uh...
control processing

943
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,789
denoted in the weapon's affects only

944
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:24,619
is when you

945
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:28,499
force subjects to respond within five
hundred milliseconds within half a

946
00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:30,920
second

947
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,779
under those circumstances

948
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:35,369
these red bars to show you the data from

949
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:37,209
above the from the last slide

950
00:43:37,209 --> 00:43:39,869
funded and the under those circumstances

951
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:45,430
of bala responding is primarily
influenced by automatic processing

952
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,359
one of the chorus

953
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:51,019
responding within five hundred
milliseconds is mediated by automatic

954
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:54,389
processing right you can't do anything
else within five hundred milliseconds

955
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:58,140
economic blink your eyes with them
within five hundred milliseconds

956
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,979
this is the standard condition where the
weapons of fact

957
00:44:00,979 --> 00:44:03,349
was discovered

958
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,209
it's dominated

959
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:05,999
by controlled processing

960
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:08,150
so the point here is

961
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,209
there's really no reason

962
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:12,229
to believe

963
00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:17,269
that social behavior as it started in
the laboratory is dominated by

964
00:44:17,269 --> 00:44:18,969
unconscious automatic processing

965
00:44:18,969 --> 00:44:23,449
when you actually use something like the
method of opposition to do with the

966
00:44:23,449 --> 00:44:23,939
comparison

967
00:44:23,939 --> 00:44:25,110
you discover that

968
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,119
at the very worst

969
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,130
past performance is mediated by

970
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,269
a balance

971
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:33,340
of controlled and automatic processing

972
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,720
conscious and unconscious processing

973
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,139
and in many circumstances

974
00:44:38,139 --> 00:44:45,139
conscious processing dominates automatic
processing there was a question or her

975
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:49,229
yeah priming itself is

976
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:54,319
prob partly conscious hall and not holy
automatic as we what might once and for

977
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,069
the past

978
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:57,569
despite these studies

979
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,519
okay and despite the fact

980
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,789
the evidentiary base before any studies
was relatively weak

981
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:07,009
the argued that the idea that human
behavior

982
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:09,800
for the human thought and action and
experience

983
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,729
was largely

984
00:45:11,729 --> 00:45:16,329
altman mediated by unconscious processes
operator automatically has been very

985
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:19,129
very very seductive

986
00:45:19,129 --> 00:45:21,270
or here's all the goodies park

987
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,510
or the whole stronghold issue

988
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:27,599
of american psychologist what's been
called the ladies home journal of the

989
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,630
psychological profession everybody gets
a everybody reads it

990
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,339
alm

991
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:36,440
the source of behavioral control comes
not from active awareness but from

992
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,430
mental activations of which we are all
aware

993
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:43,339
and environmental cues to which we are
not gonna consciously attending that

994
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:44,200
have a

995
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,749
found effect on our behavior

996
00:45:46,749 --> 00:45:49,339
i don't see it

997
00:45:49,339 --> 00:45:53,659
sandra blinks liens very good appalled
popular science writer is right in the

998
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:54,949
new york times

999
00:45:54,949 --> 00:45:59,219
in navigating the world in deciding what
is rewarding humans are closer to some

1000
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:00,029
bs

1001
00:46:00,029 --> 00:46:01,510
and censured beans

1002
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:02,759
most of the time

1003
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,700
there is no evidence for that

1004
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,509
there's just

1005
00:46:06,509 --> 00:46:08,479
evidence all for that

1006
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:12,809
here tim wilson professor of psychology
university of virginia

1007
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:14,959
of riding in a in a book

1008
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:19,029
freud's view of the unconscious was far
too limited

1009
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:21,329
florence view of the unconscious

1010
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:26,109
far too who committed robin when he said
bed consciousness is the tip of the

1011
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:30,910
mental weisberg he was short of the mark
by quite a bit

1012
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:34,459
consciousness may be more the size of us
mobile on top

1013
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:37,059
i'll bet iceberg

1014
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:40,969
two things have to be said about this
freud never once an old was written move

1015
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:43,159
of god at all of my office

1016
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:46,519
used the iceberg metaphor for
unconscious mental life that suburban

1017
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:49,710
wedge in never ever used to be iceberg
metaphor

1018
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,739
on in print

1019
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:54,589
the second point is there is no evidence

1020
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:56,099
the proposition

1021
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:57,709
that poem

1022
00:46:57,709 --> 00:46:58,859
that's our

1023
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:01,300
consciousness is just put the snowball

1024
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,430
on the tour of the tip of the iceberg

1025
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,739
much less on the tip of the iceberg

1026
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,869
all the evidence we have

1027
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:09,079
suggests that in fact

1028
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:12,130
as to colby originally postulated

1029
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:16,369
performed past performance tends to be
mediated by a balance of conscious and

1030
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:18,180
unconscious prostheses

1031
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,529
that differs

1032
00:47:19,529 --> 00:47:24,149
bone for one circumstance to another
like if you receive like if you require

1033
00:47:24,149 --> 00:47:28,529
fast response latencies they're going to
get performance dominated by unconscious

1034
00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:29,040
processes

1035
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,890
if you let people take their time

1036
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,749
they're going to get performance
dominated

1037
00:47:34,749 --> 00:47:38,319
there is no evidence or for any of this

1038
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:43,519
many of you have read about if you have
and read malcolm gladwell lhs book blink

1039
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:46,889
armed at all of the gladwell is one of
the finest popular science writers

1040
00:47:46,889 --> 00:47:50,709
working all of those working today

1041
00:47:50,709 --> 00:47:51,099
subtitled

1042
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:54,369
the power of thinking without thinking

1043
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:58,029
and the argument in blank is that we
don't really consciously think about

1044
00:47:58,029 --> 00:47:59,279
anything

1045
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:03,339
ordered everything goes off
automatically at all

1046
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,579
support of our brains of these different
closures

1047
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:08,369
is colby adaptable unconscious

1048
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:10,730
and the study of this kind of decision
making

1049
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:13,140
fun conscious decision making

1050
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,790
automatic decisionmaking is one of the
most important new fields of psychology

1051
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:23,350
and global goes on motivated in the book
onto our group to kind of or repeat

1052
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:26,940
the art though the work of barge and
others as evidence

1053
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,689
for the dominant brawl

1054
00:48:28,689 --> 00:48:32,099
of one conscious processing in
psychology

1055
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:33,029
home

1056
00:48:33,029 --> 00:48:34,429
one more

1057
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:38,259
that wagner at home now professor at the
uh... at harvard

1058
00:48:38,259 --> 00:48:42,389
albeit in a book and internal delusion
of conscience will

1059
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:46,189
the real causes of human action are all
unconscious

1060
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:50,139
though real causes of human action or
unconscious

1061
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:51,880
so it is not surprising

1062
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,540
that behavior could often arise as a
north of the custody experiments

1063
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:00,400
without the person had been conscious
insight into qualities causation

1064
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,469
this is what i refer to as well be the
autumn it has to be juggernaut

1065
00:49:05,469 --> 00:49:07,540
widespread acceptance by certain

1066
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,069
although theorists

1067
00:49:09,069 --> 00:49:11,299
for the proposition

1068
00:49:11,299 --> 00:49:15,400
conscious processing plays no role in
social interaction

1069
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,849
conscious processing plays no role in
behavior at all

1070
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:20,220
little word overall

1071
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,179
that in fact

1072
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:22,499
our experience

1073
00:49:22,499 --> 00:49:26,629
thought and action is a product of
unconscious processes

1074
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:28,239
operating automatically

1075
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:31,439
i don't have time to do this so bill
would put in the lecture

1076
00:49:31,439 --> 00:49:35,389
of one of the poem supplements

1077
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,640
why would people believe such a thing

1078
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,909
when in fact there is no evidence for
this

1079
00:49:40,909 --> 00:49:44,759
all we have for evidence of on of all
the role of automata city

1080
00:49:44,759 --> 00:49:46,990
is a bunch of demonstration experiments

1081
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:48,840
but don't actually compare

1082
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,019
the power of automatic unconscious
processing

1083
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:54,070
whatever we do all those experiments

1084
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:54,569
comparing

1085
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:58,019
the power of automatic unconscious
processing

1086
00:49:58,019 --> 00:49:59,839
we all replied out

1087
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,680
that in fact past performance is based
on a balanced

1088
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,979
all i think there are all basically all

1089
00:50:04,979 --> 00:50:06,009
two reasons

1090
00:50:06,009 --> 00:50:08,510
the most important for our report
purposes

1091
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:12,150
is what the philosopher colon flanagan
refers to as

1092
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,959
conscious shyness

1093
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:18,680
consciousness just makes people nervous
for abolish

1094
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,829
of reasons

1095
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:23,680
all i'm for it and and and uh... under
the bed and at one of those is

1096
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,829
it makes apartments very hard for people
who understand

1097
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:31,839
how conscious thinking l_a_ a rule in
the physical world

1098
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,380
for that reason

1099
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,930
long people can

1100
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,060
this position

1101
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,289
of pepper phenomenal ism

1102
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:43,630
words on these moral behavior it's all
automatic

1103
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:46,599
we're simply conscious of what we're
doin what we've done

1104
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:51,519
in that sense were conscious on these
but consciousness plays no rule and what

1105
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,749
we do

1106
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,240
do i have to say it again and four
seconds

1107
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,259
there's no reason to think this

1108
00:50:57,259 --> 00:51:01,130
it may be true that were conscious on
these

1109
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:04,610
but the kind of evidence that underlies
the autumn it has to be juggernaut

1110
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:08,619
gives us no reason to think it's true

1111
00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:09,629
okay

1112
00:51:09,629 --> 00:51:11,729
next week will pick up on new topic

1113
00:51:11,729 --> 00:51:15,510
they contrast between explicit and
implicit

1114
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,579
cognition emotional motivation

1115
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:18,079
thank you very much
