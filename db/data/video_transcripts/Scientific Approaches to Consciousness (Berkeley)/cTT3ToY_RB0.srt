1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,710
okay let's begin

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,990
and let's begin just for the reminder

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,459
something you already know

4
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:11,269
which is that we've got a uh... midterm
exam

5
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:15,269
scheduled in this class for next
wednesday

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,609
maybe more details about the exam

7
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,830
day after tomorrow this wednesday

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,460
when with any luck i will finished
writing it

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,109
but here's the basics

10
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,109
our midterm next wednesday march
sixteenth right here in class

11
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:32,750
although i have an in-class review on
monday march fourteenth

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,830
that'll be done as a question-and-answer
session

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,500
are those of you will check your e-mail
today

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,660
if there's anybody who doesn't check his
email every five minutes

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,090
those who haven't checked your email
today i sent out

16
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,580
a link to the rome

17
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,370
narrative review for the midterm exam

18
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,360
sold devil

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,900
these we take care of that

20
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,970
and i'll just answer questions

21
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,660
palm

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,200
the exam itself is going to twenty five
short answer questions

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,710
and i don't know whether there's going
to be choice or not but just haven't

24
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,290
figured that out yet

25
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,860
on i don't like to have choice

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,159
sometimes i have to

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,929
and it'll cover everything since the
beginning of the class

28
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:09,700
right up and

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,360
right up through are wednesdays

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,130
all you don't have the i've done of the
via blue book for this will give you the

31
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,610
exam you're right right on the exam

32
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,270
hauled all you have to do is bring your
heads

33
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,020
and uh...

34
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,880
and your family

35
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,550
ok we'll talk more about that

36
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,000
okay last

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,869
last lecture we talked about evidence
for implicit perception including some

38
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:42,549
little perceptions so-called subliminal
perception

39
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,010
balm which is a construct

40
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,410
that we have by analogy to implicit
memory

41
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,270
in implicit memory we have
representations and past events

42
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,690
that influence people's behavior even
though they can't consciously remember

43
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,090
those events

44
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,090
in the implicit perception we have
representations of

45
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,230
current events

46
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,540
events in the current stimulus
environment

47
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,420
that influence people's behavior

48
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,520
in the absence of conscious perception

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,449
of those events

50
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:15,559
and this is an old problem it so
fascinated one on and it's one that

51
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,890
raises the question of just

52
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,379
how much

53
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,889
processing can you get subliminally

54
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:24,659
just how much processing can you get
outside of awareness

55
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:28,719
a question that was raised by vance
packard and others begin in the nineteen

56
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,620
fifties

57
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,729
armed with complaints about subliminal
advertising

58
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:35,379
like the

59
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:38,889
example from the two thousand
presidential campaign

60
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:40,789
only in a clinical context

61
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:44,759
you can often see advertisements for
so-called

62
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,629
subliminal self-help tapes

63
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:49,100
which are supposed to present messages

64
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,630
letters subliminal that start that get
around the barriers on consciousness all

65
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,069
and i help you to ons lose weight stop
smoking

66
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:01,459
flying dog

67
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,729
somebody loves you do all sorts of
wonderful things

68
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:10,379
and in the experimental domain lloyds
silverman a all applaud

69
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,049
the late lloyd silverman the saws

70
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:14,699
psychologist that though

71
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,409
new york university

72
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:20,969
all road in the sixties and seventies a
provocative series of papers

73
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,440
suggesting that the sub little
presentation of the phrase

74
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,640
mommy and all you are one

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,819
had profound effects on people's
behavior

76
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,010
pawanticku though they could impair

77
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,819
various kinds of aspects of

78
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:36,899
mental performance in through the
private people and others

79
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:40,259
and would also improve performance in
normals

80
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:42,149
silverman was a psychoanalyst

81
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:43,519
as you might guess

82
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,219
all but the berry idea

83
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:50,269
that a phrase like a mommy and all your
one what the hell does that mean to

84
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:51,269
begin with

85
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:51,940
all

86
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,420
or you could have all white seven
presented sublingual lee

87
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,470
all-new could analyze that for me no
doubt demeaning what affect your

88
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,559
behavior in various kinds of ways

89
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:04,099
these are reprieve different ways of
asking

90
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:07,120
the question about the scope of
subliminal perception just

91
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,209
how much processing and all how much
processing can you get

92
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,689
we can answer that question in part

93
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:15,219
palm

94
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:16,069
and unordered

95
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:19,259
show you how we've answered that
question or tried to

96
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,850
argued introduce you to one more

97
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,220
subliminal perception paradigm were
implicit perception paradigm

98
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,099
which is a halt

99
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,940
known as some little affect iv

100
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,310
the studies are showed you last time
were also subliminal semantic priming

101
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,229
the meaning of the prime dr

102
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:42,709
influences the processing ave
semantically related word alike vs

103
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,899
and then subliminal affect a priming

104
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:48,919
it's not the denote a div meaning of the
prime that influences the processing of

105
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:49,999
the target

106
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,770
it's the connotation meaning of the
prime

107
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,130
that influences processing of the target

108
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,889
whether the prime

109
00:04:57,889 --> 00:04:58,139
represents

110
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:03,240
i think that's good or i think that's
bad it's a motion or on a balanced

111
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,229
and so when these kinds of experiments
is a paradigm devised by anthony

112
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:10,849
greenwald tony greenwald s university of
washington

113
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:14,969
you present subjects with an aspect of
lee balanced

114
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,729
a good thing

115
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:17,249
friend of

116
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:19,800
or a bad thing like enemy

117
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,399
you mask the primed for the subjects can
see it consciously

118
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,979
and then your present them with an
affect of lee balanced target

119
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:30,939
a good thing like wins or a bad thing

120
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,220
why closes

121
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,970
and the subjects task is simply to look
at the target

122
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,279
and make a judgment

123
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,439
about whether the target represents a
good or a bad thing

124
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,180
that's all you have to do with the
affect their judgment

125
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,060
and the general idea behind subliminal
affect depriving is that the affect of a

126
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,839
list of the prime or to influence affect
him

127
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,440
judgments about the target

128
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,599
so that if the prime is a good thing

129
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,939
that ought to facilitate judgments about

130
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:57,860
good things

131
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,179
vote impaired judgment about bad things

132
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:01,810
if the prime is a bad thing

133
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,690
it ought to facilitate judgments about
bad things

134
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,689
and uh... inhibit judgments about good
things

135
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:09,990
and so it does

136
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,550
here are three early experiments by hall
by greenwald

137
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,099
and his colleagues

138
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:17,650
in which we have

139
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,569
an affect a prime minister affective
target

140
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:21,789
and here we have

141
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:24,789
the relationships between them galen
green

142
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:28,619
we have a positive prime and a positive
target

143
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,659
in purple

144
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:32,150
or blue i guess it is

145
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,330
dark blue on negative prime in a
positive target

146
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,800
in white blue what positive private
invented target

147
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,659
and in of

148
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:43,770
a negative prime and uh... negative
target

149
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,729
and what you can see here

150
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:47,729
a nice priming effect

151
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:53,319
soldiers group prime in fact that could
be called how a double whammy

152
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,789
if you have martha what they are the
positive prime

153
00:06:57,789 --> 00:06:59,550
that facilitates

154
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,319
all borrowed would be aspect of
evaluation of a positive target

155
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,229
compared to what caused the private
negative toward it

156
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:09,209
if you have a negative

157
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:10,849
prime emanated target

158
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,510
that the silicates

159
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,840
performance all of the final processing

160
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,499
compared to

161
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:17,869
a positive primal indicative target

162
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:19,289
now this is a case

163
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:23,460
where there's an eighty millisecond
almost all of the whole interracial

164
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,220
crime

165
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,339
driven its mast

166
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:30,639
in this case it's not mask so the
primers consciously perceptible

167
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,300
what you've got in the middle is

168
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,180
and eighty second any millisecond prime

169
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,469
that's messed so that the subject can't
see it and you can still see

170
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:41,199
significant

171
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,599
priming affects

172
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:43,539
and here

173
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:45,739
all you've got a forty millisecond prime

174
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:47,909
only half the direction for the prime

175
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:51,210
and then followed by the mask and you
don't get much of a primate effect of

176
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,550
the positive case

177
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,449
but you do get so still gets on prime
unitech turned the negative case

178
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,069
let's just focus on

179
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:01,990
this one's for a moment which is the
standard of of the very end here

180
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,319
you get it may be eighty milliseconds of
the prime at its best to still don't see

181
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,520
it because of the mask

182
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,040
palm and all

183
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,949
to get nice

184
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,590
the beasley subliminal

185
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,379
of the prime minister

186
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,860
here's another way to plot this data
like this is under another study by huda

187
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,580
what by greenwald

188
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,810
all here

189
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,590
we've all plotted be detected bility of
the prime basically the percentage of

190
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,079
trials on subjects

191
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,529
all can detect

192
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:31,660
trial

193
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,810
and all of them

194
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,050
here we have the magnitude of the prime
minister

195
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,910
and at the

196
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,010
calm but that the at the crossover point

197
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,150
where the prime sarraj's zero detect
ability

198
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,520
you're still getting

199
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,660
a significant primate affect so that's
just another way of showing

200
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,640
that this'll this psalm

201
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,910
called the factor prime minister

202
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,620
is in fact home

203
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,170
is in fact

204
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,650
unconscious priming effect

205
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,880
subjects or not conscious of the crimes
they don't consciously detect them

206
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,050
but you still get a significant affect a
priming effect

207
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,330
noticed by the way

208
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,880
then with the magnitude of the affect of
prime minister act is much smaller

209
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,330
when the prime is on conscious that when
the primers conscious

210
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,940
capsule kate that's not that's not a
problem

211
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,440
the point here is

212
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,460
that you do get some private affect even
when the prime itself

213
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,290
well that's that's the that's the first
of our limitations here okay

214
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,000
it's not that

215
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,990
consciousness makes no difference

216
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,799
to the prime minister act

217
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:40,730
consciousness makes a big difference to
the prime minister act but you can still

218
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,350
get priming even when subjects are
conscious of the prime

219
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,290
here is another limitation

220
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,500
what dog rewarded here

221
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,830
was look at the

222
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,030
the a synchrony between the presentation
of the prime and the presentation of the

223
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,680
mask

224
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,280
that is to say

225
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,840
basically hollow along the bu yacht the
prime is presented the subjects

226
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,430
seventeen milliseconds which is

227
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,490
pretty short that's about as short as
you can get on the standard computer

228
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,680
thirty three milliseconds four fifty
milliseconds

229
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,080
and what you can see is that you get out

230
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,140
nice priming effect

231
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,920
if the prime as presented for a third of
a second

232
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,920
unsorted done thirty three milliseconds
or fifty milliseconds

233
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,579
if you present the prime for all the
seventeen milliseconds

234
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:32,030
you don't get much more primary effect
at all so

235
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,820
you have to do these things called right
the prime has to stay on for a

236
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,890
reasonable period of time

237
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,630
okay before it's masked

238
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,860
or you don't get to know or you don't
get the affect

239
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,110
here is another all aspect of the legal
limitations on subliminal f active

240
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,970
priming in the previous correct what i
showed you

241
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,620
was the

242
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,200
through all of the amount of time that
the

243
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,020
prying

244
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,460
is presented

245
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,690
the all

246
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,150
the prime time interval between the
presentation of the prime the

247
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,790
presentation of the mass

248
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,310
here mogra looking at

249
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,770
is the interval between the presentation
of the prime

250
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,320
and the presentation of the target

251
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,390
okay

252
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,390
all whether the

253
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,699
the your private presented superwoman
away here and green

254
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:19,830
or sub liberally ought hear in blue

255
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,730
if the prime is on math

256
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,690
so that it's clearly bizarre bowl to the
subject

257
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,079
the prime targets stimulus onset they
say gritty doesn't make much difference

258
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,849
yeah there's a little bit of random
variation but it doesn't really make

259
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:34,250
much difference

260
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,200
but when the prime is subliminal

261
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,100
you will only get a primate effect

262
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,190
if the target is presented really
quickly

263
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,430
after the

264
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,890
all that after the time right after the
prime is presented

265
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,320
sixty-seven milliseconds which is not a
lot of time

266
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,310
you've got a nice priming effect

267
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,570
eighty three milliseconds just a little
bit more delay

268
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,170
prime infect goes down

269
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,479
a hundred or two hundred milliseconds

270
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:03,180
and the prime minister basically goes
away of goes away byerly

271
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,140
so again

272
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,630
there is semantic processing and there's
affect a processing of unconscious

273
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,029
primes

274
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:17,169
but only on dirt very of limited
circumstances the prime has to be on for

275
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,570
sufficient period of time

276
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,400
the prime dog target

277
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,470
can't be too long

278
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,220
this is all less than a second

279
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,400
yurman hapless second

280
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,850
palm gov goes between the presentation
of the prime of the presentation the

281
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,410
target

282
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,740
the prime infect disappears yet

283
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,810
yeah this is the prime

284
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,600
target stimulus onset it with a
simplistic

285
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,199
the devote the time

286
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,750
between the on some of the prime

287
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,170
and the onset

288
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,440
four hundred milliseconds that's less
than half a second

289
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,270
if there is a very very very short
duration

290
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,430
between beyond some of the prime in the
on some of the target

291
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,760
you can get

292
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,460
follow subliminal priming effect

293
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,129
but the longer that duration

294
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:07,630
experiments

295
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,189
the less priming you get

296
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:13,230
and it doesn't have to expend a report
this is less income for the second

297
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,800
levels like it

298
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,529
there are some temporal limitations to
these priming affects

299
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:20,899
on they don't last very long

300
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,450
uh... involved in

301
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,329
uh... implicit

302
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:25,290
uh... of perception

303
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,649
here's another really interesting

304
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:28,120
limitation

305
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,470
which has to do with the amal and of
processing you can perform

306
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,259
on a subliminal prime even under

307
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:37,190
fall optimum conditions

308
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,430
this is another experiment by greenwald
is very very very clever experimenter d

309
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,240
worked on this project for about a

310
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,100
ten years

311
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,540
didn't do anything else

312
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,350
uh... and uh... really did some nice
work

313
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,439
all the studies that i've shown you so
far involved

314
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:56,170
the single word prime

315
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,600
affecting processing of a single word

316
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,660
okay whether it's more cells experiments
doctor priming nurse

317
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,860
or greenwald's experiments

318
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,710
enemy priming

319
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,630
word like loses

320
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,790
what greenwald did law in this
particular experiment

321
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,160
was to construct

322
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,300
true word of crimes

323
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,500
from his original stimulus materials

324
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,810
and what's interesting

325
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,850
is that if you construct a true word
prime

326
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,810
from to negative words

327
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:31,090
you can get a phrase with a positive
connotation

328
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,710
hero wins

329
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,930
hero and wins for both positive words

330
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,809
positive positive

331
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:40,670
the implication is positive heroes are
supposed to win

332
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,890
enemy wins

333
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,669
here's a negative word

334
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:45,100
combined with a positive word

335
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,190
the implication of the phrases

336
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:47,660
negative

337
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,780
you know one your enemy to win

338
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,149
our hero loses

339
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:55,040
a positive word combined with a negative
word

340
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,579
you plication the phrase is negative

341
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:02,810
you know one heroes to lose any more
than you want enemies to win

342
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:03,850
enemy loses

343
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,690
a negative word combined with a negative
word

344
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,290
it's a good thing

345
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,430
okay

346
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,349
so if people get that

347
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:16,640
if people can process the arabic the
conduct a newbie villa two-word prime

348
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,330
a phrase like enemy loses or what up
crime affect of judgments about positive

349
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,980
targets

350
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,160
okay so that's what you want to look at

351
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,820
and the answer is

352
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,000
also here

353
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,040
we've got arm

354
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,439
to positive allahu phrase granola
considered too positive words

355
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:42,540
we've combined the two are conditions
where there's a positive and negative or

356
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,510
word and then you've got negative a
negative words

357
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,730
this is the process of the magnitude of
the prime minister act

358
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,480
and what you can see here is

359
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,150
palm

360
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,299
on negative negative fall

361
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:56,580
called

362
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,560
phrase

363
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,410
connotation really positive being affect
early positive

364
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,570
or a prime processing will positive
target and it doesn't

365
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,240
okay those are very long response
latencies

366
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,660
compared to these others

367
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,820
these two conditions positive positive
and positive negative

368
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,610
they do pride

369
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,460
positive or positive target but they
don't prime processing of a negative

370
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,990
target if anything

371
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,270
too negative words

372
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,280
facilitates a little bit

373
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,320
the processing of a negative target

374
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,190
so what that means is

375
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:32,140
people tend not to extract the meaning
at all but true words to a stimulus

376
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,170
what to word prime

377
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,740
when that crime is presented
subliminally you've gotta have super

378
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,680
liberal you've gotta have conscious
processing for that

379
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,629
justo

380
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,580
bug jitters just to kind of rome this
out a little bit

381
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,590
if people can't

382
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,540
figure out

383
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,590
that the word under prop up the phrase
like

384
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,070
enemy loses is a good thing

385
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,680
what could they possibly do with the
long

386
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,270
complicated cycle went over the queen
mumbo jumbo phrase

387
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,250
money and all you are one

388
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,390
much less

389
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,950
somebody repeating you will not smoke
smoking is bad for your body you need

390
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,399
your body to live and all those other
things

391
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,790
that allegedly appear on subliminal self
help tips

392
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,760
yeah i just can't do it

393
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,309
subliminal processing

394
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:20,490
is simply analytically all ltd

395
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,140
while you can only do so much

396
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,840
semantic processing or effort to
processing

397
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,470
all they subliminally presented

398
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,560
so just to summarize this little bit

399
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,880
limitations on subliminal perception

400
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,080
the limitations are brought the via fax
or relatively weak

401
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,100
all subliminal implicit perception
affects in the typical case are nearly

402
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,809
as strong as implicit memory of facts

403
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:47,530
for reasons altogether the second

404
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,990
second the effects of our time limited

405
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,800
the prime

406
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,050
the all interval between the
presentation of the prime of the

407
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,410
presentation a mask

408
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,720
can't be too short

409
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,620
it has to be short

410
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,480
because if it's too long you see the
prime

411
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,530
it can't be too short either or you
don't get to process the prime role

412
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,640
and the prime target as a way

413
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,670
can't be too long either

414
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,730
along with me

415
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,390
dull

416
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:16,470
because so terribly whatever process
union you do

417
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,300
is relatively rapidly for garden

418
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,200
semantic processing is possible with a
subliminal

419
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,990
of the stimulus

420
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,030
it's analytically limited you can only
do so much

421
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,290
you might be able to extract the meaning
of a single word

422
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,270
but you're not going to be able to
extract the meaning of the scope of two

423
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,380
word phrase

424
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,210
much less

425
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,620
an entire all

426
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,870
much less in the players and

427
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,880
lasting about subliminal perception

428
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,940
or it was a perception in general

429
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,230
is simply to all remind you of the
relations between implicit

430
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,640
perception of the one hand

431
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,490
and implicit memory on the other

432
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,640
both implicit memory and implicit
perception

433
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,200
or revealed by prime interfax

434
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,350
where one stimulus

435
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,350
facilitates the processing

436
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,580
another stimulus

437
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,790
but they differ in large part in terms
of

438
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,470
where that for stimulus occurs

439
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,950
in the implicit memory

440
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,629
the primers the stimulus in the past
environment have occurred alone

441
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:18,980
a long time ago

442
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,700
in psychological terms

443
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,049
more than thirty seconds hong

444
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:25,940
all though let's hope psychologist

445
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,130
did before and want to a memory

446
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,330
in amplicor perception the primacy in

447
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,230
the current stimulus environment that's
happening right now or it happened just

448
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,860
a moment ago

449
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,910
call him what

450
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,450
william james called the species present

451
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,669
james's point being

452
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:43,690
we're never really in the present

453
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,490
you know whatever we think of as the
president really wants

454
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,110
a couple of milliseconds

455
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,320
there's another distinction here that i
really want to promote boggled focus on

456
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,120
for a second and that is

457
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,820
the private in that when prime in occurs
in the implicit memory

458
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,710
the person was consciously aware of the
prime when it occurred

459
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,820
but just

460
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,529
isn't consciously aware of

461
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:15,059
that it occurred at is it's not that
there's no conscious awareness of the

462
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,110
republic god

463
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:16,809
of the event

464
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:19,160
in the past no conscious recollection

465
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,760
in implicit perception

466
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,240
the person is not consciously aware

467
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,440
of the memory when it occurs uh... to
begin

468
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,700
most of the research on unconscious
cognition focuses on the implicit

469
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,230
memory

470
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,560
and implicit perception of basketball

471
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,130
of research

472
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,270
but that's not all there is to cognition

473
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,549
leading us to wonder whether they are

474
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:44,160
evident and the evidence for unconscious
coffin

475
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,160
you know other domains of cognition

476
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,940
can you have something like implicit
thinking

477
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,730
can you have off

478
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,380
that affects your behavior

479
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,610
even though you're not conscious of that
thought

480
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,590
then you have implicit morning

481
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,580
can you learn something that affects
your behavior

482
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,790
even though you're not conscious of what
you've learned

483
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,670
let's take the first one first

484
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:12,260
this is classic work by oracle reimer a
psychologist a brooklyn college

485
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,530
on what he called implicit learning

486
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,780
then rebirth experiments

487
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,470
subjects were asked to study strings of
the letters

488
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,620
letters drawn from they are the alphabet

489
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,330
and these letters these these letters
strings

490
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,950
were all composed according to

491
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,470
all what we call when congress science
in cognos psychology

492
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,450
and artificial grammar

493
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,950
that is a set of rules that specifies
the order in which

494
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,240
all letters should appear in the strain

495
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,570
this is one such artificial grammar

496
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,800
that weaver all used

497
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,139
and the way you read this

498
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:51,520
all it is so hard to is as follows

499
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:58,190
use you go with you went to the grammar
this is a said the the firstgov and

500
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,890
it can be ida red t

501
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,430
for api

502
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,200
if the first item is to be

503
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,510
then the second item

504
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,720
can either be and ox

505
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,820
or in the ass

506
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,000
if the second item is an ass

507
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,609
that s can be repeated

508
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:18,430
that can be repeated forever if you want

509
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,470
it can be annex and so on

510
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,620
the first item can be a t

511
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,520
or a p

512
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,600
the first item is a p

513
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,380
then the second item

514
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,270
will be either a t

515
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,560
or abhi

516
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,159
if the first night of the p

517
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,379
and the second item fifteen you could
repeat that please

518
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:38,270
vide infra night up

519
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,420
okay that's the way

520
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,440
you read these artificial grammars

521
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,350
so that

522
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,950
spring-like

523
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,500
t access

524
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,000
is grammatical

525
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,990
here's the third string

526
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:57,990
that could be pure secularism acts the
sect but they're going to be a s

527
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,090
and so on and so forth

528
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,390
p

529
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,799
the second letter can be to be of the
rudy

530
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,809
in this case

531
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:09,490
it's a v

532
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,210
that's how

533
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,970
these artificial grammars generate these
strings

534
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,940
that's all the strings were generated

535
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,290
wad re-worded was to send his subjects
down

536
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:23,280
all up and say this is a test of memory
and what i want to do under presented

537
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,200
with a bunch of nonsense

538
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,980
strings there just lover strung together

539
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,950
palm

540
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,180
and all that i want you to memorize

541
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,279
so subjects studied these letters
strings in

542
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,179
and in anticipation

543
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:37,769
falguni later

544
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:39,340
memory test

545
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,130
poem and they did that

546
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,290
on uracil

547
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,519
this these are in fact

548
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:47,830
the letter strings to be reused in his
very first experiment and you can

549
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,110
imagine this is not an easy exper

550
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,400
this is one of those experiments where

551
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,140
afterwards you really want to kill
yourself for children experimenter

552
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,759
qualm

553
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:59,309
because that's just

554
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:00,480
completely mindboggling

555
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,290
uh... politics for a bit but subjects
will do it

556
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,650
palm and didn't get subjects do almost
anything you can motivate them

557
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,140
all well enough

558
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,480
and they did that

559
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,220
at that point alm of the rebirth and
tested their memory for the strings

560
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,110
and then he's surprised on the

561
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,990
all

562
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,050
i would request to make a grammatical d
judgment return of the subjects we said

563
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:25,500
what i didn't tell you before

564
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,470
was that the each of these strings was
each of the strings you memorize

565
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,290
was

566
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,870
are composed according to a particular
grammar a set of rules

567
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,250
now i'm going to present you with a new

568
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,429
of strains

569
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:41,940
and what i want you to do

570
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,250
is to tell me

571
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,900
not whether you remembered before cuz
they roll no

572
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,040
what i want to do is to tell me

573
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,820
whether string conformist

574
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,170
that part of herschel grammar

575
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,740
that's a grammatical adi judgment

576
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,040
uh... task

577
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,950
and so we present them with no strings
like these where grammatical springs

578
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,480
catherine redden on grammatical strings
are and uh... black

579
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,950
and what reversed finally was

580
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:12,049
wasn't subjects were able to identified

581
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:14,010
grammatical letter strings

582
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,889
had raised over better than chess

583
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:20,119
two alternate forced choice fifty
percent as chance bob sixty percent

584
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,350
sometimes a little bit better

585
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,460
compared chancery a base rate of fifty
percent

586
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,760
but he discovered

587
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,650
they could not tell him

588
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,360
through the grammatical rules

589
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,080
that they used to base these judgments
on

590
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,220
here is

591
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,470
data from

592
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,230
water rivers early experiments

593
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:46,790
he resolved

594
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,460
the big the condition of just described
or the subject for us to memorize the

595
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,320
letter strings and we've got performance
of people who

596
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,280
word asked

597
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,430
to try to figure out what the rule was

598
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,250
gorgeous test

599
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,640
what the rule was

600
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,000
the recess to memorize here or subjects
who were asked to both memorized and try

601
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,890
to figure out the rule and what we were
found is that

602
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,560
if your ass to memorize and not

603
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,330
as to figure out what the rule is

604
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,830
you're actually better at making
grammatical grammatical judgments

605
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,280
then if you're asking them arise and to
figure out

606
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,700
what the rule was that was both
demonstrate the power

607
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,729
called for

608
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:24,220
of implicit learning

609
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,120
parker

610
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,030
here's subjects are nesta memorizing
just were asked to look at the strings

611
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,610
here the strings are at in fact all
random they don't conformed any

612
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,940
grammatical rule

613
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,159
and so that's a very bad at the grand
isle

614
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,500
what the grammatical rule is which

615
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,260
that's a control condition

616
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:44,820
and hear the subject of just dog over
breck she told what the rule was affects

617
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,730
still had difficulty doing it

618
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,559
our performance was best

619
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,499
in these implicit conditions

620
00:26:50,499 --> 00:26:51,460
where subjects

621
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,030
we're not pass to figure out what the
rule was

622
00:26:54,030 --> 00:27:00,130
and they couldn't

623
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,530
so study like this

624
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,059
suggests

625
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:08,010
that there's something to the idea of
implicit learning that you can

626
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,019
acquire knowledge through experience

627
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:12,039
that's what learning is

628
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:15,830
and have that knowledge affect your
performance

629
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,540
even though you can't

630
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,820
consciously

631
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,260
retrieve the knowledge even though
you're not consciously aware of what the

632
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,380
knowledges

633
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,340
volitan rebirth story

634
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,170
subjects

635
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:30,350
then of course so memorizing urges
viewing these words

636
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,029
automatically abstracted the grammatical
rule

637
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:37,049
their knowledge of the grove of the
grammatical rules that influenced their

638
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:38,309
grammatical and judgments

639
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:40,549
but it was all done on consciously

640
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:41,540
and they couldn't

641
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,650
are consciously recollect any of the fit
any of the aisle nor any of what they've

642
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,230
learned

643
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:52,580
we now have evidence for implicit
worried in this sense

644
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,850
where subjects like water knowledge

645
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,610
through experience

646
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,269
knowledge that i

647
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:59,179
fax their behavior

648
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,919
in the absence of conscious awareness of
what that knowledges

649
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,219
and a whole number of different hong
uh... situations here is rivers

650
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,240
artificial grammar word in experiment

651
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,900
there's also lol orders for the number
of books for vince ustinov complex

652
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,850
systems paradigm

653
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,240
use up the subject of a save the manager
of a sugar mill

654
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,120
there's so much

655
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,000
sugar cane that comes into the mail and
so much

656
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,980
process sugar that goes out of the mill

657
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,740
and between the input in the output is
some kind of very complex system that of

658
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,310
that that uh... specifies relationships
between the two

659
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:39,480
and what those and the finding is that
subjects can learn to predict the output

660
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,759
of the system

661
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:41,980
given the endpoint

662
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,380
even though they can tell you what the
mediating

663
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,289
calls of sequence learning

664
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:50,379
you put subjects in front of a computer

665
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:54,340
you told me one of them to respond as
quickly as possible whatever they see a

666
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,700
point of light flashing up on the screen

667
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,940
the screen is divided into four
quadrants

668
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,790
like comes up and one of the quadrants
of the respond

669
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,820
but there is a sequence

670
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,780
the experiment

671
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,399
so that over trials

672
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:10,430
there's a particular pattern

673
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,370
fall quadrants that's repeated over and
over and over again

674
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,200
pick up on that pattern

675
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,330
because they're faster to respond on
later trial so they were on the earlier

676
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:20,820
trials

677
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,990
but if you ask him

678
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,940
was a ready pattern

679
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,940
they say no

680
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,299
okay they're not aware of the pattern

681
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:31,160
category learning something so very
similar and then finally although there

682
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,630
are demonstrations of both classical and
instrumental conditioning on that occur

683
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,960
even though the subject is not aware

684
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,430
of either the conditions stimulus

685
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,840
for the on conditions stimulus

686
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,610
my favorite experiment of the sort was
one done by a russian psychologist

687
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,459
gregory rads ran

688
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:50,870
back in the sixties

689
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,480
in which

690
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,830
he had subjects wall of fistula

691
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,000
which put a blue moon in there

692
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,960
stomachs

693
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,410
replayed atoned

694
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,370
slated the balloon

695
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,160
okay which pre which creates a little
bit of all

696
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,760
well a lot of little bit of discomfort

697
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,360
all that you do it to it'd be if you
would pleaded

698
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,410
two big try have some time you'll see

699
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,040
palm

700
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,370
but there's a lot there's a level which
is just don't feel anything at all

701
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,820
yet he was able to measure although
responses in the gastrointestinal system

702
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,480
to this even those subjects were not
aware

703
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,350
albee although i'll be on conditions
stimulus

704
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,610
it's the kind of experiment

705
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,260
i suppose you could only do with certain
laboratories buttons chords for

706
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,020
and

707
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,219
and i really like it

708
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:36,100
in each of these cases

709
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,809
subjects or clean water knowledge

710
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:41,640
use that knowledge in subsequent
behavior but they don't know what they

711
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,390
know

712
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,190
they don't know what they've learned

713
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,640
will call that

714
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,800
implicit learning or unconscious
learning

715
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,240
okay so now would look at the relation
between implicit memory an implicit

716
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,149
learning

717
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:57,510
let's look at the relation between

718
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,140
implicit

719
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,530
member amazon sorry before but look at
the relation between implicit memory an

720
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,980
implicit perception

721
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,760
now let's look at the relationship
between implicit memory an implicit

722
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,190
warning

723
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:13,890
a question that arises naturally because
memory learning or so closely related

724
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:16,020
when you learn something a dump it in
memory

725
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,680
if you don't have a memory

726
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,330
you really can't learn anything

727
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,520
right so they got to be related

728
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,800
implicit memory and implicit learning or
different at least in my view in a

729
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,110
couple of ways

730
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,320
in the first place

731
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,690
and implicit memory the priming effects
that we observe in and music haitians

732
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,280
for example

733
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,419
what we're looking at is the or
unconscious influenced bob stovall vent

734
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,039
that occurred in the past

735
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:47,659
okay but the subject cannot consciously
called not consciously remember

736
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:48,510
palm

737
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,919
and important so that at the sonic
memory

738
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:52,260
in implicit learning

739
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,650
over really looking at is the
unconscious influence of what you might

740
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,330
call semantic memory or procedural
memory

741
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,929
some piece of

742
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:03,020
abstract knowledge that you've acquired

743
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,880
or through uh...

744
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,750
through experience

745
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,530
palm

746
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,879
in the implicit learning

747
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:13,369
the subjects are clearly aware of the
learning experience all of rebirth

748
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:16,450
subjects of usa body of the doing for
the last forty five minutes to take

749
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,649
on the study in your damn listed

750
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:19,820
letter strings

751
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,640
they are aware of what they were doing

752
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,169
anticipations

753
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:27,980
park aware of what they've been doing
they can't consciously i'll remember it

754
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,990
palm

755
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,590
and in it was a learning as i say
there's nowhere else of the new

756
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,280
knowledge that they've acquired through
experience

757
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,450
there's a halfway case

758
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:37,990
armed

759
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,760
which is known in the trade as force
amnesia something we can see with

760
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,940
both emmys that patients and with

761
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,419
under a logically intact

762
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:47,850
uh... subject

763
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,559
where calm

764
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,230
subjects

765
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,050
learn something through experience

766
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:56,120
they're aware of what they've learned

767
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,950
but they're not aware alba learning
experience okay so they've acquired some

768
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,760
new piece of semantic or procedural
knowledge

769
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,810
but they're not aware of the episode
through which they acquire that

770
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,900
best example of this is off

771
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:15,220
is a uh... case study of by you know the
great swiss psychologist birds clapper

772
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,040
red

773
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,879
all who worked for a time in a clinic

774
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:20,360
volume switzerland

775
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,960
or benefit all of the dell with hetal
large

776
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,040
grupo form of of course the car patients

777
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,560
that is patients who by virtue of mostly
alcoholism

778
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,860
had suffered

779
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,779
bilateral damage to the diane cephlon
and were rendered and music much the

780
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:37,950
same way that agent was

781
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,420
well one day clapp a red came on the
ward

782
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,270
palm and on he walked up to a patient
and said uh... do you know me do you

783
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:50,710
know who i am she said no

784
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,249
called

785
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:52,670
and he held out his

786
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:56,320
hand to the introduced himself and
doctor clapp a red or you held out his

787
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,779
hand too

788
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:01,830
halted to show that you have to have my
call polite people do

789
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,980
and all that

790
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,360
all discovered that

791
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,820
clapp a redhead hidden a job of append

792
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,930
in his hand

793
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:09,720
that pricked

794
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,539
her hand and caused her

795
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:15,299
alarm some distress atrial injury she
was a bleeding all over the floor or

796
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:16,949
anything like that

797
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:19,259
she was pissed

798
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:19,999
palm

799
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:23,470
she was drawer and began the yelling at
him lol

800
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:28,049
all as salt was apologizes positions
wont clapp a red left

801
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:32,379
the ward and left it to the nurses to
calm the patient down

802
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:35,889
palm dubbed the best patient got popular
come down

803
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:39,110
at which point clapp a red came back
onto the ward

804
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,649
approach the patient said all do you
know who won

805
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:44,550
no

806
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,540
cost she's a music right she doesn't
remember anything that's happened to

807
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,210
work

808
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,560
on have we ever met before no

809
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,819
well i'm doctor clapper read it's nice
to meet you when he held out his hand

810
00:34:55,819 --> 00:34:58,839
and she refused to take it

811
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:03,469
aman clapper red esther why she said

812
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:09,170
sometimes people highly depends in their
hands

813
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:12,439
she got the semantic knowledge okay

814
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:15,299
all inches consciously aware of this
move

815
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:17,319
facts that you learned about the world

816
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:20,760
that sometimes people hide pens in their
hands

817
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,329
but she was not aware of the learning
experience

818
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:27,719
leave me if i walked up to you introduce
myself to you and pricked your hand with

819
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,620
the pin

820
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,690
you'd remember that

821
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,630
and it would show up on my course
evaluations lakeview

822
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,240
it wouldn't be

823
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,230
sometimes people are people hide pins in
their hands idbi

824

kill stranded this horrible thing to be
on monday

825
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:43,430
you'd remember the episode

826
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,809
as well as uh... as well as the fact

827
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:49,890
sulfur semi just kind of a minute and
intermediate case

828
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,979
where subjects are aware of a new
knowledge but they're not aware of the

829
00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:56,279
learning experience

830
00:35:56,279 --> 00:36:00,679
on call that a barbarian dot implicit
memory because what's being for dot

831
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,959
is an experience

832
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:05,799
in implicit warning

833
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:06,929
consciously accessible

834
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:09,859
is something closer to semantic or
procedural

835
00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:11,170
all home

836
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,170
procedural memory

837
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,799
paul cain now

838
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,039
last one

839
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:18,790
palm

840
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,190
and that is

841
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,400
unconscious thinking

842
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,640
is a possible took think

843
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,969
but not be conscious of thinking

844
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:31,799
convert it seems like a non couple
contradiction in terms and in fact

845
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:33,160
william james thought it might

846
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,029
ought be

847
00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:37,549
but we've already made the case for
unconscious memory

848
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:40,759
rewarding made the case were unconscious
perception

849
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:45,259
reported that the case were unconscious
morning white-hot unconscious thinking

850
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:50,599
long ago altman portrait early cognitive
psychologist named wallace

851
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:54,400
all or the drug tried to make a case for
unconscious thinking

852
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,049
when he articulated what he called the
stages of thought

853
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:00,499
five stages

854
00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:04,579
that he thought people went through
whenever they tried to solve a problem

855
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:07,219
or engage in some kind of reasoning

856
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:09,719
the first stage is one of preparation

857
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,419
which really just has to do with
learning your book burning the

858
00:37:12,419 --> 00:37:16,249
background if you're an engineer in your
working on airplanes

859
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:17,229
prepare yourself

860
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:18,819
by org

861
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,920
uh...

862
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,139
mortensen whatever dynamics and
metallurgy and things like that

863
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:25,839
then you've got this problem

864
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:26,940
okay

865
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,640
and

866
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,339
precisely because edsall problem you
don't know what the answer is you don't

867
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:36,380
know what the solution is that's not
knowing what the solution is that makes

868
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,669
but what makes a problem radio a problem

869
00:37:39,669 --> 00:37:41,150
wide some point

870
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,949
we solve the problem

871
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:44,759
that's what the poem

872
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:48,549
that's what art dot wallace called
illumination or you get some insight

873
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:49,939
into the problem

874
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:55,930
and then you verify yuor insight by
checking out making sure that all works

875
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,959
you've got a problem your prepare for it

876
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:00,739
and his soul that and you check it

877
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:02,209
inbetween however

878
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:03,630
wallace postulated their burden

879
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,779
two stages

880
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:06,730
involved

881
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,160
unconscious thought

882
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,130
and the first of these was one wallace
called incubation

883
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,400
and i wallace's idea here

884
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,009
even if you don't

885
00:38:17,009 --> 00:38:20,420
even if you're not consciously thinking
about our problem you're not

886
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,349
fit your you're thinking about it

887
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:23,839
unconsciously or all along

888
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,049
this incubation process is kind of a fun
conscious problem solving activity

889
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:31,719
and then at some point you come to a
stage

890
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:34,159
that wallace called intimation

891
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,789
but which we might now prefer to call
intuition

892
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:40,099
you know the problem solve oval

893
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:42,709
kind of no andy's

894
00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:45,800
i can tell you exactly what the solution
is yet but

895
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,349
hollings i would fall were born i'm
going to get it's own

896
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:50,190
the off

897
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,650
obvi upbeat get the our hikes periods

898
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:56,569
where all the sudden the solution comes
in onto memory

899
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:59,040
this is a little bit like liggett's is

900
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,999
pitied perceptions

901
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:01,690
alm

902
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:05,819
wallace had this idea that you got the
little germ this little flame of thought

903
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:09,920
and they gradually grows hodder
gradually grows more intense until you

904
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,640
can feel a calming and then you can see
it

905
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,680
incubation process

906
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,030
where a thought

907
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,729
gradually

908
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,529
alva gradually gained some strength

909
00:39:19,529 --> 00:39:23,480
and there are a lot of examples of this
kind of incubation effect

910
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,940
in history problem solving their very
common in science

911
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,799
here's a famous one from the home

912
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:31,700
all from the article

913
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,509
french math mathematician point kar rae

914
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:35,289
all

915
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,809
i turn my attention the study is america
medical questions of currently without

916
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,219
much success in without a suspicion

917
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:44,759
of any connection with my preceding
researchers

918
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:45,980
disgusted with my failure

919
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,760
i want to spend a few days at the
seaside always a good help

920
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,589
for problem solving

921
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,349
and thought of something else

922
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:57,069
one morning walking on the block the
idea came to me

923
00:39:57,069 --> 00:40:01,279
with just the same characteristics of
brevity suddenness of the media

924
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:01,890
certainty

925
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:06,030
that the arithmetic transformations of
indeterminate turner required braddock

926
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:12,139
forms were identical with those of the
non-u euclidean geometry

927
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:13,159
okay

928
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:15,859
all one parade claimed

929
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:19,140
this insight had to be a product of him

930
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,699
unconsciously working on these another
on this problem

931
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:23,860
all the time

932
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,590
and then

933
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,940
at some point the solution just kind of
got

934
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,429
got intense enough

935
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:33,419
and uh... and became accessible to
consciousness and there are lots of

936
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:34,849
examples of this

937
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,879
in the scientific literature

938
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:42,309
on here's another famous one key cooley
structure of the benzine ring

939
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:45,109
nike over his claim drug claimed

940
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,239
couldn't solve it

941
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,420
and then dalton

942
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,839
he had a dream hauled before snake by
dean its tail

943
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,379
and uh... he woke up from the dream
instead

944
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:57,740
that's the structure of the benzine
rings

945
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:00,390
closer to it when i want to reading

946
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,209
all

947
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:05,929
on again the idea greer is that he went
to sleep thinking about it

948
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:06,960
while he cut

949
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,099
prophecy that on consciously while he
was asleep he had this dream and then

950
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:12,659
you realize that are significant

951
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:14,450
lot of anecdotes

952
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:17,459
unfortunately they're mostly joyous
anecdotes

953
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:17,890
alm

954
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:18,670
uh... and

955
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:23,189
uh... there are problems with this
intuition it's entirely possible

956
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,400
for example

957
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,289
that all the time one parade was walking
on the bluff on the seaside

958
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:31,539
he was really thinking about this
problem

959
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:32,960
that's not a very good story

960
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,529
a really good story is

961
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:36,970
heedless of the song

962
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:37,710
the song

963
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,689
uh... inside emerged with a lot of
nowhere

964
00:41:40,689 --> 00:41:42,680
ca cooley solid although

965
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,390
all that anecdote is really good
accepted cocco it was actually in a

966
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,879
priority debate with another campus

967
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:53,399
who also claimed to have discovered the
structure of benzine

968
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:56,509
and could cooley says well i did at
first does that occurred to me in a

969
00:41:56,509 --> 00:42:01,249
dream on august eleventh eighteen sixty
five or something like that

970
00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:01,789
home

971
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:04,440
and so you don't really know what to
make of that

972
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,449
foghorn either

973
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:09,290
and we know the people's intuitive
judgements can be misled

974
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:14,330
bio whole host of factors of
collectively known have judgment your

975
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,220
wrist

976
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,989
when you bring incubation into the
laboratory turns out to be very very

977
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:20,419
very difficult

978
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:21,010
together villains

979
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,470
uh...

980
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,430
almost until recently anyway

981
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:28,819
most evidence for incubation called poem

982
00:42:28,819 --> 00:42:31,819
most experiments an incubation suggest
that

983
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:34,640
the solution than any other kind of
forget it

984
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,029
okay and then it babe ruth them every
member of parliament later

985
00:42:38,029 --> 00:42:39,830
or maybe even incubation

986
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,500
what appears to be incubation isn't part
of the fact of

987
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,559
certain inappropriate problem-solving
strategies

988
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:47,230
more recently however

989
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:51,260
palm reduced dumaguete evidence for
incubation in the laboratory

990
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,189
and a number of paradigm

991
00:42:53,189 --> 00:42:54,459
for example

992
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:57,219
using dog remote associates test

993
00:42:57,219 --> 00:43:01,529
also ralph and martha uh... bed nick
devised this

994
00:43:01,529 --> 00:43:05,599
loosing this on jeopardy a million times
saw those of you who played certain

995
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,589
board games at home

996
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:09,679
songs on how to see these kind of thing

997
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:14,599
so that task in the remote associates
test is to say

998
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,819
word to the following three words have

999
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:17,770
volvo

1000
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:21,099
the share as a common associate

1001
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:25,319
three stimulus words are democrat

1002
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,359
and your job is to come up

1003
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:29,940
what the common solicitors

1004
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,680
don't say it

1005
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,759
who knows what the answer is

1006
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:38,999
okay let's just leave it at that maybe
somebody will have an incubation effect

1007
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:39,450
arm

1008
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,669
here's another example the so-called
nine dot problem

1009
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:43,390
okay

1010
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:47,290
and thus of the persons of problem is to
connect the dots

1011
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:50,280
by drawing four straight continuous
lines

1012
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,829
never lifting the pencil from the paper

1013
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:57,969
who knows how to do this storm say how
to do is

1014
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,029
think about that one

1015
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:02,959
you know or don't think about it better
of a better yet

1016
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:04,799
and see what happens there

1017
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:08,869
well in any event there's now a
laboratory evidence for home

1018
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:11,089
for something like incubation

1019
00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:15,519
insulting both these verbal and non
verbal problems here's a review

1020
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,920
or by sight eleanor marauder couple of
years ago

1021
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,679
ono funnel over a hundred

1022
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:22,529
all two hundred studies

1023
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:23,630
showing

1024
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,489
they're actually does seem to be small
affected incubation

1025
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:32,099
both on linguistic problem solving of
well-liked though

1026
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:34,399
young remote associates fest

1027
00:44:34,399 --> 00:44:36,239
alva or creative problem solving

1028
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,130
like the uh... like the nine dot

1029
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,249
like the nine dollar problem

1030
00:44:41,249 --> 00:44:43,079
and all

1031
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,859
you can reduce this by increasing
cognitive load by distracting subjects

1032
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:52,410
which suggests that there really
thinking about it

1033
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,649
here it is

1034
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,880
i think i can do it

1035
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,079
one maybe ill do too

1036
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,440
here's a nice example

1037
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,289
although something like an incubation
effect

1038
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:02,289
in uh...

1039
00:45:02,289 --> 00:45:06,019
within the laboratory this is work by
the lake and the power is a professor at

1040
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:10,509
university of waterloo in canada on a
very into all of the remote associates

1041
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:11,229
test

1042
00:45:11,229 --> 00:45:14,659
known as the diet adds the triads test

1043
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:16,420
what paul bowers david

1044
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,039
was to take

1045
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:21,439
route lou or eighty like

1046
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:24,089
one of which the words really do have

1047
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:25,900
a common associate

1048
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,109
and the others

1049
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:28,540
that the other trio

1050
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,579
uh... they don't

1051
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,019
have a common associates

1052
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,880
so for example

1053
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,440
white winds

1054
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,400
there are they all have

1055
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,589
as the common associate

1056
00:45:38,589 --> 00:45:41,009
still pages and music

1057
00:45:41,009 --> 00:45:44,189
i think bahrain psychotic levels of

1058
00:45:44,189 --> 00:45:47,779
of what was the so see asian of there's
no warm

1059
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:48,920
no common associate

1060
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,769
uh... they're not was ever discovered
one anyway

1061
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:54,449
but this is all really hard one

1062
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:56,300
all only about twenty percent

1063
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,589
of subjects will solve this problem

1064
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,359
when they are

1065
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,940
when they first get it

1066
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,789
and so what happens is

1067
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:08,199
if something subjects can say which is
the soluble triad is close to say

1068
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:09,489
one event

1069
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:13,309
but if u can't say which is the soluble
triad

1070
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:15,259
flowers that goes on and says

1071
00:46:15,259 --> 00:46:18,509
uh... double bed isn't can say what the
solution is

1072
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:21,219
followers goes on and asks is subject

1073
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:22,349
well okay

1074
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:23,749
which triad

1075
00:46:23,749 --> 00:46:25,209
is soluble

1076
00:46:25,209 --> 00:46:27,249
which triad

1077
00:46:27,249 --> 00:46:27,590
has

1078
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,499
a common associate

1079
00:46:29,499 --> 00:46:31,279
and bowers finding is

1080
00:46:31,279 --> 00:46:34,980
that subjects can distinguish between
soluble

1081
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,279
and insoluble triads

1082
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:40,769
at levels that are better than chance

1083
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:44,409
you know they can tell you what the
solution is

1084
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:48,529
that's likely wallis is intuition you
have an intuition about what the

1085
00:46:48,529 --> 00:46:51,560
solution is even though you're not
consciously aware

1086
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,339
of exactly what it is

1087
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:55,659
here are

1088
00:46:55,659 --> 00:46:57,559
five hours and his colleagues

1089
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:58,940
all of which show

1090
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,299
that subjects

1091
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:02,549
intuitive troy cigs

1092
00:47:02,549 --> 00:47:05,700
in podiatry triads all of the situation

1093
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,689
are correct

1094
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:10,959
more than you'd expect by chance but
sixty percent of the time little douglas

1095
00:47:10,959 --> 00:47:13,209
compared to fifty percent base rate

1096
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:16,209
even though the subjects can tell you
what the solution is

1097
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:18,319
so here you have something like

1098
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,639
anon conscious thought

1099
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:23,980
the solution is clearly directing your
behavior

1100
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,499
released pretty clearly directing your
behavior

1101
00:47:26,499 --> 00:47:30,809
even though you don't know what what the
solution is

1102
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:35,019
victor shamas registered in my
laboratory palm cove

1103
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,809
well what was actually able to show

1104
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:40,410
solved triads

1105
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:42,040
can actually

1106
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,380
create semantic priming affects

1107
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,709
even those subjects don't know what the
solution is here's an example

1108
00:47:49,709 --> 00:47:52,489
you have been subjects are prime

1109
00:47:52,489 --> 00:47:55,390
not subliminal primes these are
conscious prime sick

1110
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,499
come up and you can see the clearly

1111
00:47:58,499 --> 00:47:59,079
died

1112
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,649
and chair

1113
00:48:00,649 --> 00:48:02,899
all of which have

1114
00:48:02,899 --> 00:48:04,079
the word

1115
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,109
party in common

1116
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:09,169
high note climbed on a plane chair

1117
00:48:09,169 --> 00:48:11,489
for the again to bring a difficult one

1118
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,999
all what shamas did was to

1119
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:15,069
present the triad

1120
00:48:15,069 --> 00:48:18,640
if the subject new what the solution was
a response to say

1121
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,619
if they didn't know what the solution
was

1122
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:22,870
he then

1123
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:23,909
presented them with

1124
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:25,199
the target

1125
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:29,009
for all lexical decision task just say
whether it's a word or not

1126
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:31,329
and a fine he was

1127
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:34,299
these three-word primes

1128
00:48:34,299 --> 00:48:34,920
prime

1129
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,190
what i call the sessions

1130
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:37,779
of the targets

1131
00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:43,900
even when the subjects didn't know the
solution to

1132
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,589
clearly high was primed

1133
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:47,960
with activated

1134
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,800
in semantic memory

1135
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,700
and influenced people's judgments about
whether a was a word or not

1136
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:59,009
even those subjects were not aware that
height was the solution to the problem

1137
00:48:59,009 --> 00:49:01,339
here are three examples

1138
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:04,229
from childless is on the doctoral
dissertation

1139
00:49:04,229 --> 00:49:05,729
in which

1140
00:49:05,729 --> 00:49:08,959
the controllers where there's no
semantic relation between

1141
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:12,140
the three-word prime and the target

1142
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:16,400
where they're is a semantic relationship
between the three were prime of target

1143
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,669
and what you can see is a

1144
00:49:17,669 --> 00:49:20,839
very nice priming effect

1145
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:25,339
so far faster response latencies

1146
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:27,309
wherever there's a cement relation

1147
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:30,099
and that primary effect occurs

1148
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:33,949
even those subjects are not aware of
what the answer to the question is

1149
00:49:33,949 --> 00:49:37,149
they haven't achieved that solution

1150
00:49:37,149 --> 00:49:39,619
okay soul regatta

1151
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:40,510
over this

1152
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,129
and just get to the bottom line here

1153
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:45,169
in the implicit thought

1154
00:49:45,169 --> 00:49:50,109
we have the effect of some idea
something that's in the head

1155
00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:54,319
and i've been a major fallout although
whatever

1156
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,559
on on experience thought vaction

1157
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:01,589
in the absence of conscious awareness of
what that idea is

1158
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:02,409
sometimes

1159
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:06,469
the idea is a perception based
representations some buckets of

1160
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:08,559
representation of what something looks
like

1161
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,120
in the shama send the borrowers
experiments

1162
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,240
it's a meaning based representation

1163
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,009
it has to do with the meaning of the
object

1164
00:50:16,009 --> 00:50:18,239
but it's not a percept

1165
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,479
subjects never saw the word high as a
prime

1166
00:50:21,479 --> 00:50:23,150
it's not a memory

1167
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,289
subjects never saw

1168
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:27,339
the word high at any point in the
experiment

1169
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:28,450
it's awful lot

1170
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:32,250
it's something that they generated
internally and response to other kinds

1171
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,689
of stimuli

1172
00:50:33,689 --> 00:50:36,649
it some thought that influences their
behavior

1173
00:50:36,649 --> 00:50:39,729
but it's a fourth it influences their
behavior

1174
00:50:39,729 --> 00:50:42,969
even though they are not conscious of
the fox

1175
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:44,680
the fun conscious thought

1176
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,229
it's implicit flawed

1177
00:50:48,229 --> 00:50:50,009
implicit murmured memory

1178
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:51,049
perception

1179
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:52,019
learning

1180
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:55,630
fought there's even some evidence now
for implicit language i don't have time

1181
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:56,939
to do it

1182
00:50:56,939 --> 00:51:01,869
next time will go beyond the domain of
cognition and look at evidence for

1183
00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:03,700
implicit

1184
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,789
and implicit the emotion

1185
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:10,929
that affect our behavior outside of
continuity obsessive conscious awareness

1186
00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:14,150
of what those motives and emotions are

1187
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,539
thank you very much
