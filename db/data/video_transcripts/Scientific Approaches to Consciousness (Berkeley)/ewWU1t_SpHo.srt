1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,090
okay let's turn our attention to

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,399
the thing you just woke up i would've

3
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:13,809
sleep injuries

4
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:16,070
let me just say that

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,249
costs we've got to

6
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:21,210
lots of material to cover in this course
and only a very limited time to do it

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,609
i can spend as much time on any of these
topics as i'd like to

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,900
all and that's the case for sleep and
dreams as much as it is for anything

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,079
else

10
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,739
fortunately we have lots of other
resources on the berkeley campus for

11
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:37,799
those of you who are interested in
learning more about various aspects of

12
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,310
sleep injuries

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,930
first we have a whole chorus on the
psychology of sleep psychology one

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,070
thirty three

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,650
which is talk alternately by professor
allison hardy and professor matt walker

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,420
are both of whom run

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:58,420
very gooood

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,740
sleep laboratories very interesting
sleep laboratories will talk a little

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,440
bit about mad walker's work

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,140
all later today

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,930
and then professor roller or wash draws
an ad altman operative asian chorus

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,090
devoted entirely to the psychology of
dreams

23
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,650
and on the history of dream
interpretation what the meaning of

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,890
dreams might be and all of that

25
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,729
so if you're interested in this

26
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,850
if i don't kill your interest in that
over the next couple of days

27
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,369
wanna learn more you should not talk to
these guys

28
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:29,909
forgetting sold

29
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,140
why should we be interested in sleep and
of course on now

30
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,990
and of course one consciousness

31
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:40,340
the first is that like anesthesia sleep
seems to represent all lapsing

32
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,430
unconsciousness

33
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,400
wet and philosophers for example tried
to talk about what consciousness is all

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,840
about

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,600
sometimes as i pointed out last week the

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,790
contrast

37
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,990
consciousness with

38
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,320
general anesthesia

39
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,180
other times probably more cobb were
wrong

40
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,740
commonly

41
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,659
they contrast or the consciousness with
the whole asleep and especially whipple

42
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,800
with what they like to refer to as green
was

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,180
uh... suite

44
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,550
so that's the first reason

45
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,890
that somehow

46
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,820
palm sleep

47
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,640
rep represents a contrast

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,769
with conscious mental life

49
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:18,730
the second dog point all take up all
club on wednesday

50
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,120
is that it turns out that they are all
sorts of things going on in our heads

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,739
while we are all the while we sleep

52
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:29,040
on there and all of while we sleep we
might very well be conscious at home

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,169
bit all over all the dreams and other
kinds of mental activities

54
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:34,440
so there is all

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,569
all of the the relationship to altered
states of consciousness

56
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:41,949
all of the third all reason is that
there's lots of stuff that goes on in

57
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:43,769
the environment

58
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:44,480
outside

59
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,689
palm dot outside the mind of the sweeper

60
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:51,509
palm and are what we want to know is
whether perhaps all of those sleepers

61
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:55,540
can engage in various kinds of
unconscious processing

62
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,530
we hear anecdotally about people being
able to

63
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,299
wake up at a preset time without benefit
of an alarm clock

64
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:07,279
that suggests that somehow the sleeper
is keeping track of the passage of time

65
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:12,669
all we also on here anecdotally about
parents awakening selectively to

66
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:17,239
the all across is a brother noises and
their children's bedrooms while but not

67
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,939
blow away coming too

68
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:21,380
hall louder more intense voices

69
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,829
on outlaw out on the streets so there's
all sorts of interesting

70
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,729
or questions about

71
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,079
is going on on during the hard during
sleep

72
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,040
and then finally all of the blob

73
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,889
cognitive scientists and psychologists
have been interested in sleep

74
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:39,599
for what it might tell us about the
mind-body problem

75
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,579
sleep injury misrepresent radical
changes unconsciousness

76
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,469
and those radical changes in
consciousness or associated with radical

77
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,709
changes in brain activity

78
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,460
then on studying the coral it's there

79
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,860
all my tell us something about tall
about some of the neural correlates of

80
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,340
consciousness so thats basically

81
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,529
why you were interested in that

82
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:03,340
uh... as far as the scores

83
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,749
well is concerned

84
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:07,149
so how do we know when somebody's asleep

85
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:10,829
if you ever had the opportunity to sleep
next to somebody

86
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:13,790
home or you can know you often tell

87
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,620
all that there is lead by virtue of
their

88
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,730
overthrow over behavior the changes and
relax ation

89
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,960
home usually sleeping

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,110
prone

91
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,469
people have been known to sleep in
shares

92
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:30,089
and people have been known to sleep
standing up

93
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:32,770
fell asleep standing up once in a row

94
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,639
museum in mexico

95
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,830
don't quite know how i did it but i did
it

96
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,060
are and you also lol

97
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,460
well are open to the sleepers oral off
usually characterized by very slow very

98
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,680
even breathing

99
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,289
not to say about the city's soaring

100
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,009
so that those are all over behaviors
that are used to diagnose sleep and were

101
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:55,340
used to diagnose sleep exclusively

102
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,250
often told all controlled relatively
recently

103
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,889
but there are also subjective
experiences

104
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:06,110
that enable us to diagnose so home you'd
be on the the onset of sleep

105
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,159
all first when people wake up

106
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,570
all from sleep they often experience
themselves as having

107
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,319
headed interruption in the stream of
consciousness

108
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,699
they find that they are not aware of
things that have been going on

109
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,729
for the last couple of minutes so work
for that matter for the last couple of

110
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:22,650
hours

111
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,979
so when he falls asleep in a movie or a
florio play or a quart of or or a

112
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,170
television program

113
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,369
the lawful makeup and say what just
happened

114
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:34,579
so there is some kind of blank their
that you have to uh... that you have to

115
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,029
fill in

116
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:36,819
alm

117
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,440
stars are similar legal

118
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,050
when people awaken especially if they
way kanata particular stages of sleeps

119
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,370
on panel talk about again in a second

120
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,580
our people seem to be disoriented

121
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,060
qualm

122
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,860
they've been not only don't know whether
they were asleep often well but they

123
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,729
sometimes don't know exactly alone

124
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,289
exactly where they are hot where what
time it is

125
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,509
there are a memory failures we diagnose
sleeps objectively but we can't remember

126
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:02,289
something that's been

127
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:05,620
we should be able to remember that's
been happening recently

128
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,340
and we also what are the diagnosis leaps
objectively

129
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,290
when we all but we remember that we've
just been dreaming and his bizarre

130
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,189
experience is about

131
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:18,370
dragons riding bicycles or whatever you
dream about

132
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,990
home and usage if you know i must've
been asleep cause

133
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,340
dragons dole ride bicycles

134
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,439
in the real world

135
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,059
okay so there are lots of ways

136
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:30,219
now my real world

137
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:32,610
alliance or what's a different ways in
which we can

138
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,840
of make-up to get it to the an
impression of somebody

139
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,889
were sold

140
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:39,280
we fallen asleep

141
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,449
there are of course better ways to do
list some old technical ways although it

142
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,790
though that sort of techniques that are
now known as police armed robber feet

143
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:54,370
polly many songs sleep haha griffey
writing or or were wrong but we're

144
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,079
graphing

145
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,910
so what happens here is we fasten
subjects

146
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,910
to are number of electrical devices the
record electrical at various forms of

147
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,460
electrical activity

148
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,199
on them they can observe changes in the
use of patterns of electrical activity

149
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,639
as people fall asleep

150
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,159
and wake up

151
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:15,199
part here's a typical setup

152
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,399
alm this is something called the e_m_
gene the electoral by a breath it

153
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,069
records all muscle activity

154
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:22,219
all

155
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:26,650
and i've been will record i'd movements
from the eyes

156
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,550
and also as will see you later

157
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:34,000
all was selected to be in the chimney is
usually used to diagnose the paralysis

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,020
that alum

159
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,330
that uh... occurs with the onset of

160
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,020
certain stages of sleep

161
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,960
then we record the g

162
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,119
are typically

163
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:47,460
in in that in uh... that most instances
just one electrode will do

164
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,799
though large seem set ups where there
are whole bonnets soap

165
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:53,899
two hundred fifty six electrodes
attached to

166
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:55,269
attached to the person

167
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:57,509
and then all the stuff goes into

168
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:01,489
all of a set of machines john sometimes
known as the polygraph

169
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:05,069
all because again it's recording lots
lots lots of different

170
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:06,430
our channels hall

171
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,859
at the time

172
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:11,279
and when you do that yes

173
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,449
well but there is just a reference point

174
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,659
so arb heroes

175
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:18,759
ulm you've got golf

176
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,280
that you've got

177
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,739
electrically you've got to have a ground

178
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:24,160
on

179
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,090
so you got to put it on something

180
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,509
michael had i'm here where there's not
supposed to be much electrical activity

181
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,129
down here

182
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:34,089
of people took off the rearrange so
they're not picking up radio signals

183
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,200
from morrison alone and other things

184
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,870
like that

185
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,350
but he could put it in you can put these
things anywhere

186
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,210
it's not good for anything else except
to hang in here

187
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,850
nearing or an electrode

188
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,150
so that's what that's why

189
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,119
soul called first thing we do

190
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:57,879
is always we observed are those people
fall a sleep and wake up and all that

191
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,130
are changes characteristic changes in
the electrical activity of the brain

192
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,940
this is all over

193
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,760
the newell find this in the lecture
supplements the one if you would really

194
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,970
want to go through it

195
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,450
but mostly we're looking at three
different bands of electrical activity

196
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,560
in the g_p_ electro insightful graham

197
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,190
elf activity which is very highly fall
baldridge rod activity body control

198
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,620
cycles per second

199
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,239
beta activity which is very low voltage
activity

200
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:25,729
home

201
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:27,330
homegrown eighteen to thirty

202
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,070
or cycles per second

203
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,770
and delta activity which is very very
high voltage activity

204
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,490
high-voltage

205
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,030
for the brain

206
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,240
about dove one before cycles per second

207
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,360
you can see

208
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,030
a little bit better business lie that
used to all of the less because well

209
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,740
what's on his waves look like

210
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,690
this is

211
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,220
so-called bade activities so you can see
the high amplitude

212
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,009
very fast

213
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,690
uh... activity

214
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,629
palm elf activities so what

215
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:59,860
lower amplitude but certainly all of the
certainly somewhat civil

216
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,030
somewhat slower

217
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,360
and delta activity here

218
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,959
one before one before cycles

219
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,460
the cycles per second

220
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,560
and what happens is you fall asleep

221
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,440
is that

222
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,140
all of these various patterns the
electoral ocular ground the electoral

223
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,630
himself would grab the electoral maya
grab

224
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,319
all go through characteristic guard

225
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,339
characteristic ships

226
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,329
all of which allow us to the following

227
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:24,190
this various stages

228
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,579
obsolete which comment

229
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:27,120
to or

230
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,320
for crimes

231
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,050
depending on how you count

232
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,590
here's what the halted typical waking

233
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,410
electrodes up a ground looks like a kind
of mixture of the alpha and beta

234
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,370
activity

235
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,440
are pretty decent provides pretty fast

236
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,670
homes and so on

237
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,890
and what happens first as you begin to
fall asleep

238
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,810
you move into a stage which is known as
descending

239
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,070
descending stage of stage one st

240
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,490
which is characterized by an absence of
alpha activity

241
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,059
remember the way kini g

242
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,950
is characterized by a mix about for and
beta activity

243
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,680
and as you fall asleep

244
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,580
alf activity gradually well gradually
disappears

245
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,039
and in most laboratories

246
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:15,889
the onset of sleep is marked by the
disappearance of alpha activity in the g

247
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,049
appoint it's important

248
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:20,170
will come back to a couple of different
on times

249
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,290
so stage one

250
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,180
are descended stage one d spending
'cause you're going down into sleep

251
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,530
marked by this disappearance of alpha
activity

252
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,629
then palm in stage two

253
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:34,179
you see the appearance although new
waveform

254
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:37,779
you can see one right here this is known
as the sleep spindle

255
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,780
because of what it looks like it looks
like oh

256
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,320
knitting spindle whirl oreo what we've
been spindle

257
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,440
all of these

258
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,420
begin to appear

259
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,100
in the g

260
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,660
and there is another called feature or
called on the g dot

261
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,820
that the begins

262
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,310
which is condone is a k complex

263
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,619
and this is one this biggs spike

264
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:01,329
in electrical activity that comes on
suddenly

265
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:05,209
and goes away the occurrence of sleep
spindles

266
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:07,300
and the k_ complexes in

267
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,600
the g

268
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,940
marks the transition into on into stage
two

269
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,320
and then what happens as the person
garden continues go they're not going to

270
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,270
sleep

271
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:24,259
on to begin to get these very large very
slow waves known as delta waves

272
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:25,060
appearing in

273
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,380
uh... in the g

274
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,260
allman and then as you get this and even
further into so-called stage four sweep

275
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,439
feed she is dominated

276
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:36,100
five distal

277
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,370
one of the by the stage for activity

278
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,790
here down here at the bottom

279
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,630
you can see really good representation
of a k complexes

280
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,359
paroxysmal

281
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:46,340
they call it spike

282
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,480
the comes out just comes out of nowhere

283
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,969
and then here's a very nice example all
the sleep spindle

284
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:54,319
where you can come to see that my civil

285
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:56,840
uh... the spindle of the spindle shape

286
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,459
so what happens is as you fall asleep

287
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,799
your heat that one way to think about it
is it that you really need you

288
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,760
progressively smaller style

289
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,890
you go from this mix of alpha and beta
activity

290
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,050
delta activity

291
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:17,160
as you go into into stage form so there
is as general slowing of the g

292
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,430
all which is why

293
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,389
all of this of the this activity is
called or that the tends to be cold

294
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:23,610
slowly

295
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,820
slow wave sleep

296
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,450
and then what happens is

297
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,370
young go back up

298
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,030
you get down to stage four

299
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,889
and then you move back up to three stage
three and stage two

300
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,660
into some people books like stage one
again i'll get in a second

301
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,610
stage one again except that now

302
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,930
in this eight sending stage one

303
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,309
you see two things

304
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:49,239
the energy is very relaxed through
record almost no muscle activity

305
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,619
all from me you know

306
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:55,869
on the from the chain and you begin to
see rapid eye movements in the g_p_ eyes

307
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,239
begin to dart back and forth

308
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:00,320
login and an awesome leading fashion

309
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,960
which is something they hadn't done in
stage two and stage three

310
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,750
those are cold wet but i'd move minced
and they give

311
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,909
this one stage its name

312
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:11,580
onstage ram in the older

313
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,520
uh... in the older sleep literature you
sometimes word

314
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,370
c refer to as is sending uh... stage one

315
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,319
down through these sleep stages

316
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,780
and then back up

317
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,240
in stage one

318
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,660
and as you'll see in a minute

319
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,209
as soon as it begins showing these
either of these read these rapid eye

320
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:28,710
movements

321
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,220
if you wake somebody up

322
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,110
and all what minister show in rapid eye
movements

323
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,550
and say what he did what do you do in
fills out all that was having a dream

324
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,940
so there's a there's an association here

325
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,200
between rapid eye movements him sleep

326
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,590
and really now you had a question

327
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,300
no they'd just come out of nowhere the
come out of nowhere on i'd misspoke

328
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:59,300
they come out of nowhere in terms of the
g ok they're just appear

329
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,650
you know you will see the war all over
the brain all of the dole depends on how

330
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,759
sophisticated and expensive in the g
monitoring setup

331
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,980
all you're going to have all you need to
see you all of this

332
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,960
is that

333
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:22,960
all you need is one crummy electrode

334
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,040
uh...

335
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,810
not that i'm aware rob you can see them
pretty much everywhere

336
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,200
hong again

337
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,630
it's not easy to look

338
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,180
you can do it

339
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,029
it's not

340
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:39,250
but it's not a completely
straightforward thing the localize

341
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,790
activity in the brain from the g because
what's happening in as the surface

342
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,799
electrodes are collecting

343
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,189
a lot of information about what's going
on you might think that when you're plop

344
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:50,610
of electrode under somebody's skoal

345
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,520
that what you're recording to see i'd
get to be the brain right underneath the

346
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,200
electrode

347
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,100
and you well you are

348
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,150
you're also getting a whole bunch of
other things

349
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,500
but on in general you can see these
things everywhere you look

350
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,890
anything else about this this is just
kind of giving you a sense of

351
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,560
what goes on here

352
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,369
alm so

353
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:15,049
what we've got here is all of the
appalled at the beginning is alright

354
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,389
already are summary

355
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:18,470
of the uh... kind of

356
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,530
nervous system activity in the city and
sleep so we won't first want to

357
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,390
distinguish

358
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:28,130
between slow wave sleepwear delta
activity is prominent

359
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,230
stage ram where palm where or verb rapid
eye movements are prominent

360
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,570
so what you get a slow wave sleep is
just kind of the body seems to be

361
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,250
shutting down and that's how was that's
how was generally photo

362
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,520
heart rate goes down respiration rate
goes down

363
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,400
brain temperature goes down three bo
blood flow goes down

364
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,420
on your tension or the attention goes
out of your body become begin beautiful

365
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,329
more rel

366
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:55,130
more relaxed and all that

367
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:55,990
five movements

368
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,600
are very very hard in a very very slow
your eyes might possibly back and forth

369
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,699
in their sockets

370
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:04,129
but there's nothing like the route that
i'd movements

371
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:06,430
that you see stage ram

372
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:10,199
then ram it looks like things are all
activated again

373
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:10,560
home

374
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,690
you get variable heart rate of
respiration novel global com back up and

375
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,550
be very variable

376
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,200
home

377
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,939
some of the post through blood flow
below

378
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,660
will go up and all that

379
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,359
what really happens though when stage
graham is that

380
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,570
the person is for all intents and
purposes paralyzed

381
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,030
there is a blocking

382
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,710
motors signals coming out of the brain

383
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,140
orbit this with the level of the or that
the level of the ponds

384
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,720
that effectively paralyzes the person

385
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,030
all from roughly the audience of roughly
the eyes down

386
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,100
you'll remember

387
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,909
from our discussion last time about
locked in the syndrome that in locked in

388
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:54,789
a syndrome there's damage to the ponds
which paralyzes the person renders a

389
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:59,060
person quadriplegic but because it's
barest those too

390
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,040
cranial nerves cranial nerves three and
four

391
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,240
the person is still able to under
generate i'd movements and blinking and

392
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,390
all that same thing is happening

393
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,040
uh... vote here

394
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,400
use paralysis of the body

395
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,360
basically goes from connect out of the
chin down

396
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,779
likens there is little

397
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:20,400
uh... spares the eyes of the eyelids

398
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,400
so that you can on record these rapid

399
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,130
broad but what it means is your name

400
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,760
yet look your body has got a couple of
different ways to thermal regulate ok

401
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,880
shivering and sweating and all of that
kind of stuff third also that's

402
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,900
just through

403
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,580
actions of the autonomic nervous system

404
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,090
and that doesn't work

405
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,850
the same way that doesn't work as well

406
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:49,760
on here

407
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,210
then poem

408
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,840
independent in stage round

409
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,929
or also

410
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:57,930
or the other ways we have for thermal
regulation is

411
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,540
throwing the covers off

412
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,230
were pulling the covers on

413
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,049
and they can't do that either

414
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,480
because you're paralyzed

415
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,160
in stage ram

416
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,420
also if you're a just in your covers if
you're sticking your leg of a book on

417
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,770
the part of the blankets and all that
stuff

418
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,530
that something you're doing in stage and
ram

419
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:21,530
when when your body is able to move yes

420
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,929
going to talk about that in a couple of
minutes i hope

421
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:31,200
on that's but what's known as sleep
paralysis

422
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,030
and what you're doing there is

423
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:38,900
you've awakened i would've around you've
waited on the stage ram

424
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,419
skeletal musculature hasn't come back
yet

425
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:41,940
okay

426
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:47,960
so you're still momentarily paralyzed
because print because you were paralyzed

427
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,339
or on a beloved move

428
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:52,040
while the muscle relaxation stage ram

429
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,450
and when you experience this sleep
paralysis which

430
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,970
is surprisingly common

431
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,450
palm

432
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,370
what's happened is your cortex is become
awake

433
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,810
what your ponds is not letting those
signals go back down to the alone

434
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,210
to be

435
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,870
uh... did to your skeletal musculature
yet

436
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,299
if you just wait a little bit

437
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:14,250
when that happens just wait it out

438
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:20,320
it'll come back

439
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,170
well the first time you experienced
something like that it can be quite

440
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,630
frightening

441
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,399
on that's that that uh... that that's
quite right

442
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:28,399
all but again

443
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:32,279
if you just kind of set there for ally
there for a minute because he can't do

444
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,150
anything else and try not to panic

445
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,510
home on

446
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,160
though the all of your

447
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,450
skeletal musculature will eventually
regain muscle tone

448
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,700
all on that subject to all of those
sleep paralysis dissolve as sometimes

449
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,340
thoughtful light behind

450
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:54,830
people's ideas that they've been in dot
blot abducted by aliens

451
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,419
wake up

452
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:56,790
i can't remember anything

453
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,650
they find themselves paralyzed and it
occurs to them that martians urban

454
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,150
museums or something have

455
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,750
captured the dot all sorts of terrible
things with them

456
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,390
but the back in bed and paralyze them

457
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,020
probably not the case

458
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,640
let's just put let's just put it that
way

459
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,580
so here it goes

460
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,420
let me see if i can turn these lights
off for a second so you can see this

461
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,980
better this is all of really nice figure
from

462
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,870
called from alan hobson

463
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:29,680
uh... showing exactly what happened saw
like here over a broad over an extended

464
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,760
period of time

465
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,160
here we're looking at higher movements

466
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,740
here is the needy

467
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,890
pattern for stage one two three and four

468
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,860
here's what's happening with blood
pressure low or highlight

469
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,500
of recording of

470
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,290
respiratory activity

471
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,810
here's a recording of pulse rate or her
trade activity

472
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,720
here is a recording all body movements

473
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,870
and what you can see

474
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,810
your urine

475
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:01,059
stage one stage two stage three stage
two

476
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:04,109
back up into what would ordinarily be
part of a stage one

477
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:07,469
but you're getting a lot survive
movements and then if you go back down

478
00:22:07,469 --> 00:22:10,900
into stage two reside movements
disappear

479
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,260
when you're in this stage ram

480
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,549
your blood pressure

481
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:15,820
is going up

482
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,880
menace coming back down as you move out
of ram

483
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,220
respiration very regular here

484
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,640
then becomes irregular to reinstate
travel becomes regular again

485
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,810
heart rate

486
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,440
very regular in stage at around

487
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,639
very irregular

488
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:32,070
in stage where of

489
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,700
and then

490
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,400
fared are very of the regular again

491
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,070
and then body movements

492
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,160
you're not getting much body movement
here but you are getting some body

493
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,890
movement

494
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,350
all of the in this case ending phase
when you're coming out of staged for

495
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,750
your stage four

496
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,290
going into stage ram

497
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,660
they're not too much body movement and
then when the stage get so uh... stage

498
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,090
remnants over you're getting some body
movement again

499
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,300
that's what

500
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,280
full sleep cycle as light

501
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,580
and we now know thanks to of themselves
serendipitous discovery

502
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:10,580
that we have about five of these are
fluent in a regular nicely yet

503
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,360
not by cat account explain that i wish i
could

504
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,750
well but i could but it can

505
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,029
this is this is a sample record

506
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:24,750
what i suspect might have happened here

507
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,800
the pen went off the page

508
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,490
and comes back on which i think is

509
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,330
no book

510
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,530
actually you can do that if you suffer
from sleep apnea

511
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,080
you can stop reading

512
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,779
for a period of time

513
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:44,880
i don't think this record was selected

514
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,210
for displayed because i heard that

515
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,640
or in fact i know what some selected to

516
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,080
through one illustrate sleep apnea

517
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,760
what are people almost all of the
specially if they are overweight or they

518
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,080
have a certain

519
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,520
problems with their own that run
respiratory problems

520
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,000
our tenth stop reading for

521
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
substantial period of time

522
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,200
i have a feeling since it all for the
typically happens

523
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,230
as people or

524
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,470
falling asleep

525
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:23,110
i have a feeling that that occurs more
in stage and ram than in st ramp

526
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,690
though i'm not an expert on sleep
disorders i can find that out for it

527
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,440
also

528
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,310
the fight to have been posted something
to the website

529
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,340
put something up

530
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,629
whereas apne our current sleep cycle

531
00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:37,360
arnold tried to uh...

532
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,220
while trying to do that

533
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,649
so here's what happens

534
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:41,330
okay

535
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,390
what we do what we do this is work from
home

536
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,740
from william dement part of the dawn at
stanford plotted this very nicely

537
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,669
if you plot

538
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:53,179
a typical eight hours of sleep which of
course is what your role supposed to be

539
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:54,460
getting

540
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,230
on who can see that

541
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:57,920
start off

542
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,300
you go down into stage four

543
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,930
then into the state of ren period

544
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:07,300
then that this appears to go back down
into stage three and stage for come back

545
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,850
up into a run period

546
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:12,440
go back down into add room

547
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,330
down uptown

548
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,330
typically people awaken odors stage ram

549
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,740
when you awaken in the morning to your
moral s bright-eyed and bushy tailed

550
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,470
all ready to go

551
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,679
hongkong that song

552
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,770
that's a special almost a sure sign that
people wake undoubted stage ram

553
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:37,460
if you away that you wake up in the
morning and you would rather be dead

554
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,860
almost a sure sign that you've awakened
out of stage and around

555
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,590
when you wake another stage amram your
very sluggish in new york disoriented

556
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,669
and it just

557
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:49,170
feel like

558
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:56,170
you feel terrible

559
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,850
yes

560
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,210
although that's true

561
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:03,239
although it has to be said that there is
a there's often transit awakenings after

562
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:06,300
any state run

563
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,809
this business about people waking up
with our own alarm clock we don't really

564
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:13,250
know what's going on there here's where
i have to sorbonne eyes for half a

565
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,700
second you've never seen you do this
before

566
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,390
almost every interesting question we
have about sleep has been completely

567
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,590
ignored by sleep researchers

568
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,130
palm raciest believable

569
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,450
all i have not

570
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:32,130
and i i i blame the discovery of rapid
eye movements all for this

571
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:32,790
home

572
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,370
powerful reasons all of the whole thing
to expand on later

573
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:38,200
but we don't actually know whether
people can do this or not

574
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,600
and if they can do it how they do it

575
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,760
one prominent hypothesis is when you
would have if you're the kind of

576
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,049
personal awakens called for the without
an alarm clock

577
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:51,820
it's because you're always wake up and
check on nine check on the clock

578
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,280
part of the somehow land and and and and
falling back to sleep

579
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,559
or you're just sleeping really lightly
to begin with

580
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,690
palm abut

581
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,220
to my knowledge nobody is ever

582
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,920
mail survey people take annual wickham
of alarm clock abroad for him in the

583
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,310
laboratory and see what they do when how
they do with how well they can do it

584
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,980
home

585
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,980
i wake up spontaneously about five
o'clock in the morning

586
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,550
po and by the probe that way so i don't
set some internal alarm clock to do that

587
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,860
just happens

588
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,340
phones

589
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,570
that that's what my sleep cycle looks
like and i suspect that's what

590
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,280
happens with a lot of people

591
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:36,280
if you go to bed at a decent hour you're
ready to wake up at six

592
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,100
yeah well if you wake up all of the en
route and that is definitely

593
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,630
disorienting palm as i said you'd rather
be dead

594
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,250
home of so

595
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,350
yes i mean your concert here or in part
for seven and a half hours but the grip

596
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,490
of about ninety minutes cycle of waking
and sleeping it's just kind of an

597
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,990
average

598
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,280
long and uh... turns out that

599
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,570
already period scuttled

600
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,669
the the uh... though you know interval
between ren periods get shorter

601
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:27,169
estimates sleep progresses

602
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:29,180
so you can't really play miss

603
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,500
as much as you might like

604
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,700
all you're not

605
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,070
here do you have your brains not kind of
on uk on a particular clockwork took in

606
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,010
ninety minutes going around now enough

607
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,889
that there is anything like that that
happens that's

608
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:43,870
approximately

609
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,020
ninety minutes

610
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,760
all go into these things

611
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,200
all all sorts of other things can

612
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,890
disrupt the sleep cycle if you drink
alcohol before you go to sleep that's

613
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:56,510
gonna screw up your sleep cycle if you
drink alcohol while your wrist leaf

614
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,100
that's going to disrupted sleep cycle

615
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,410

that suppresses ram sweep

esis alright sales

621
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,210
they all suppress rem sleep

622
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,930
also almost anything you do to yourself

623
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,890
palm uh...

624
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,370
bio chemically

625
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,790
who's going to have

626
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,420
typically going to have some affect on
rem sleep and that includes taking

627
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,390
sleeping medications

628
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,200
sleeping applications articles we
compare revved sleep

629
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,900
on what you've got think they would make
a white that late

630
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,780
all but what somewhat sleeping pills do
was they catch it and uh... and ram

631
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,970
sleep pretty fast

632
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:44,789
but uh...

633
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:47,360
but they can uh... they can disrupt

634
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,020
video the floorplans

635
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,610
probably

636
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,190
that if you if you're having trouble
with insomnia

637
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,230
the best treatments republic behavioral
and nature

638
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,260
right rather than chemical

639
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,070
nature because the chemical ones have
all sorts of side effects

640
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:11,070
yet another question

641
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,120
yeah now again olympic i'm sure

642
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,950
this of course unconsciousness our
course on sleeping you really ought to

643
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,860
take one thirty three for that

644
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,200
but yes died professor david dangers at
the university of pennsylvania and and

645
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,450
and other people

646
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,539
have shown that

647
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:35,210
you can actually make up for a lot of
lost sleep if you just map

648
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:40,290
on and that nothing can be used to
replace weep all of the depth to replace

649
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,660
the standard

650
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:48,480
on eight hours of sleep the world
supposed to be getting

651
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,499
yeah yell i have to be if you think you
take a good nap a good serious nap

652
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:56,710
offer fifteen all of the fifteen minutes
or half an hour

653
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:02,010
you can get a lot of the benefits of of
sleeping kinda proably stave off the

654
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:02,770
equal

655
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:07,150
the uh... adverse effects of sleep
deprivation for example

656
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:12,100
injustice work all it is all good now
behind a new law federal aviation

657
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,169
administration policy

658
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:17,160
that allows airplane pilots to map in
the cockpit

659
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,410
not if they're the only pilot in the
cockpit right

660
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,430
palm bod carden for for example dot
trans oceanic planes usually have three

661
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,840
people in the cockpit to comply with the
plane

662
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,510
and the old rules

663
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,910
require all of them to stay awake for
all the time

664
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:37,040
new rules will while one of them to take
a nap uh... at a time

665
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,000
uh... so yeah you can do that but if you
remember that uh... episode of couple

666
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,580
weeks ago don that ronald reagan over of
ronald reagan airport where the air

667
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,870
traffic controller fell asleep

668
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:50,970
it's better to do that if you're not the
only air traffic controller in the

669
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,920
control tower

670
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,420
but if i got nothing

671
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,139
napping can be very good for you

672
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:59,880
so next time your teacher catches you
falling asleep in class just say that

673
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,320
this is very good for you

674
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,490
whatever they will go fine

675
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,490
okay now i don't want to get caught up
in all of the in london in a lot of

676
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,269
sleep stuff

677
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,980
did provide some person that

678
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,680
sleep is a real puzzle four psychology
because we have no idea was serious idea

679
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,179
what it's good for

680
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:25,919
it's clear we have a need for sleep we
have a by a lot of other and a dodgers

681
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,680
biological our biological rhythm

682
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,210
by which we go to sleep

683
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:33,029
warhol robo roughly one today and then
wake up one and then wake up

684
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:37,140
they are all sorts of theories about of
about why we sleep

685
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,769
but none of them had been particularly
well supported

686
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:42,630
uh... by young by the evidence

687
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,700
arm

688
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,379
welcomed what wild boar i'm interested
in the twelve more here on in the

689
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:48,730
in the course

690
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,830
art are kind of cognitive functions that
are associated

691
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,960
uh... with uh... with sleep

692
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,180
and here is a place for me to advertise
our professor map walker's work on

693
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,899
consolidation

694
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:02,400
although uh... sleep and consolidation

695
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,529
his laboratory has been one of the
leading laboratories in the world now on

696
00:33:06,529 --> 00:33:11,010
making the case that sleep actually
promotes the consolidation of memories

697
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:15,250
so if you learn something if you go to
sleep pretty quickly there afterwards on

698
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,200
you're going to remember it better

699
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,950
of theirs

700
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,009
there are lots of details i'm leaving
out

701
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:21,690
take walkers chorus

702
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,570
psychology one thirty three

703
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,320
home but home

704
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,180
there are aspects of cognition during
sleep

705
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,580
dunno that are of interest here

706
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,150
so i want to skip over

707
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,590
the palm

708
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:39,000
uh... work by walker and his colleagues
and just all in

709
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,960
just to come

710
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,990
these are the guys

711
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,279
who put to sleep research on the map

712
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,740
michel jude's who was a psychiatrist and
a raledu stand friends

713
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,530
on eugene as a risky who discovered
rapid eye movements on the panel k-lite

714
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,120
men

715
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,120
all that all of the pioneering sleep
researcher at the uh... university of

716
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,090
chicago

717
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:01,520
in whose laboratory as a risky was
working and william demand

718
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,750
who was

719
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,799
called the claimants are second bogdan
second graduate student

720
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,600
has for years and years and years

721
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,859
run a big sleep laboratory down outcome

722
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:14,789
down at uh... that they've done at
stanford

723
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:19,849
art and without the work of these got
about one of these old their local put

724
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,740
four people

725
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:25,539
we wouldn't know anything half of what
we know about sleep right now

726
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:29,559
biar bu bu bu the story here about as a
risk is particularly interesting is the

727
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,190
guy who discovered

728
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,200
rapid eye movements falling asleep but
in fact discovered

729
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,260
than ninety minutes cycle of waking and
sleeping on inspiration to all those who

730
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,750
was a medical student at the time doing
a research rotation

731
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,700
on and off

732
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,400
in claimants laboratory

733
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,499
and up until that time

734
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:50,870
bugged all agreed and then sleep alone
and then sleep laboratories

735
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,059
our people had only reported

736
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:54,979
all of the the g

737
00:34:54,979 --> 00:34:59,719
until people got down into so-called
stage forcefully

738
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:03,979
what looked like a dubuque what what
what looked like what was happening

739
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:08,079
the body in the brain were kinda
progressively slowing down going from

740
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,829
the mix of alpha and beta activity
characteristic of stage one

741
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:15,990
to the high levels of delta activity
there were characteristic hopeful

742
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,130
on stage four

743
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,279
and then i just assumed that that was

744
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:20,499
people fell asleep

745
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:24,849
and while there were asleep they stayed
down there doing a lot of delta activity

746
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:25,970
and then all

747
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,889
and then they came back up

748
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:32,460
all but they cost was a very good
because of the economic solve research

749
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,040
that using reams and reams and reams of
paper every night with these

750
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,850
abide by the police on the ground

751
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,279
people didn't want to people thought it
was no way stoked

752
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:44,639
to record

753
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:46,009
what's going on off

754
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:48,849
in the yard and in the brain and body or
mind

755
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:52,759
claim ended anyway he was alone one
ladies are wonder what's gonna happen to

756
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:53,440
read it

757
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,720
alleges waste this paper

758
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,680
and what he discovered was not only did
he discovered for a cycle but ninety

759
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,029
minutes cycle of waking and sleeping

760
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:06,509
all buddy also disco what discovered
rapid eye movements which nobody else

761
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:08,289
nobody had ever seen before

762
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:10,569
and he happened to hwang

763
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:13,549
songs that they just decided it was
going to wake the subject up and say

764
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:15,549
what do you know

765
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:18,329
and the persons are i've been having a
drink

766
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:21,319
and that was listed the discovery

767
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:22,859
completely serendipitous

768
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:27,269
our discovery of the association between
route that i'd movements dot com and

769
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:27,869
uh...

770
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:28,959
and dreaming

771
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,229
and at that point

772
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,559
all sleep research taco major turn

773
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:37,499
and all sorts of people started getting
interested in sleeping dreamy because at

774
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:40,179
last we had

775
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:42,399
we had an objective

776
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:44,109
publicly observable

777
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:45,059
index

778
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:47,380
or private subjective state

779
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,190
we had a way of determining whether
people were actually dreamy homes out

780
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,990
and uh... in a way that we never had

781
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,979
over that never had before

782
00:36:56,979 --> 00:36:59,149
and this as soon as people started
recording

783
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:01,229
the e_e_g_ in the eulogy from

784
00:37:01,229 --> 00:37:02,239
for mike's with

785
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,719
they began to discover that well we
don't just have one dream at night the

786
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,970
dream we often remember when we are
welcome

787
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,439
but we have four five of these trees
uh... every other

788
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:17,419
almost none of which we remember when we
awaken in the morning but all of this

789
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:20,249
basically happened because of these guys

790
00:37:20,249 --> 00:37:24,489
jude's guarded some pioneering research
on sleep and cats

791
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:27,709
well which is pretty easy 'cause that's
pretty much all they do

792
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:28,630
palm

793
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:32,640
bucked although the clad men really was
a guided who will who discovered all of

794
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,819
this is just

795
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:34,759
fascinating

796
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:36,439
leslie's story

797
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:38,499
so ok that's what happened

798
00:37:38,499 --> 00:37:41,720
uh... as a risk in play but this is
nineteen fifty three

799
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,960
they observed

800
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,930
these are tender twenty minute long
first

801
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,299
of rapid eye movement activity

802
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,719
that occurred in

803
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,989
okay sending stage one

804
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:53,960
alva boomer broccoli every of

805
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,259
every ninety minutes

806
00:37:55,259 --> 00:37:58,920
and what as a risky dead one if when he
finally got permission to do a formal

807
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,439
study he awakened subject sonogram

808
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,779
and said were you dreaming

809
00:38:03,779 --> 00:38:07,930
and he got an affirmative response filed
seventy four percent of the time

810
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:12,059
when he awakened the same subjects are
part of stage and ram when they finally

811
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:14,189
got their heads together

812
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:14,630
arm

813
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:18,640
he yard of the day he got an affirmative
response only about of them will be

814
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,759
about seven or the seventeen percent of
the time so from this one experiment

815
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,880
we discovered

816
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,839
that sleep is not unitary phenomenon

817
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,929
there are at least through different
kinds of sleep

818
00:38:30,929 --> 00:38:36,339
so-called slow wave or and around this
week

819
00:38:36,339 --> 00:38:38,519
arms of the role of the ram sleep

820
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,420
and also

821
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,940
that sleep isn't just a passive from one
of the bodies kind of shutting down

822
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,279
periodically but there are all sorts of
interesting things that are happening

823
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:51,609
happening inside

824
00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:54,469
here's the original as a risky unclaimed
and study

825
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:58,680
belinda meant in a book you wrote in
nineteen seventy-six reviewed nine

826
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,950
although order of the subsequent studies

827
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,590
everybody gets pretty much the same
called the finding

828
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:07,279
if you awaken somebody out of state dram

829
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:10,180
you'll get a dream report about eighty
percent of the time

830
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,820
if you awaken somebody on a stage and
ran

831
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,549
they'll get a dream report

832
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:18,920
home of less than twenty percent of the
time so they're really does seem to be

833
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,740
very strong association

834
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,410
between being in the stage ram

835
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:26,169
and uh... and dreaming

836
00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:30,069
so what else goes on lots of other
things go on

837
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:31,730
during our cognitively

838
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:36,220
during stage one most people will
experience what's known as a catholic

839
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,849
dodge ecr ever read

840
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:42,169
little fox and images will flow through
their called held on the flow through

841
00:39:42,169 --> 00:39:43,349
their heads

842
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:45,660
all they're not exactly dreams

843
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,400
they're not organized there's no kind of
plot there's may not be a lot of

844
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,629
activity

845
00:39:50,629 --> 00:39:52,359
all but two homes all of them

846
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:54,559
the good people will have

847
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:00,019
mostly visual imagery of various kinds
sometimes auditory on imagery

848
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:00,619
home

849
00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:04,069
and this summer descending stage one

850
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,539
or often of sometimes

851
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:08,369
wyatt anderson what is known as a

852
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:10,629
mario quantic jerk

853
00:40:10,629 --> 00:40:15,199
all which is above the variability
interested experience that people have

854
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,980
or where you're falling asleep

855
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,080
and all was said your

856
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,089
so although all the sudden your body
jolts

857
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:23,630
poland and uh... and and you'll wake and

858
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,259
that so the often accompanied by some
kind of imagery

859
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:31,260
or for me it's always song mole always
having to experience

860
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,949
falling off a motorcycle all the sudden
my body on wakes up

861
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:37,969
fall off a motorcycle

862
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,549
on food never had that experience

863
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:44,339
so about like remembering something what
i'm not afraid of that experience

864
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:47,269
cause i don't go on motorcycles

865
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:49,409
home

866
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:51,490
it just kind of comes out of nowhere
right

867
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,900
uh... and lots of people have been some
people have bother than associated

868
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,619
imagery of

869
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:58,319
falling off a wider or

870
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,589
falling out of bed or something like
that very very very common

871
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:03,290
and what's happening there

872
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:03,960
is that

873
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,590
your body is shutting down your muscles
are relaxing

874
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,420
but your

875
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,060
but all you had your muscles are
relaxing at

876
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:15,560
double dot all relax at the same rate so
one one before relaxes

877
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,329
and the corresponding pending

878
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:18,310
doesn't compensate

879
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,910
you'll get some kind of juror that's
what happens is purely physiological

880
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,709
struggle to do with anything

881
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:26,859
uh... if your waking people on a stage
and ram

882
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,809
you will all be you want that

883
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:31,200
you want to do we get a report of
dreaming

884
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,849
but you will get a report of some kind
of mental activity of the walking for

885
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:39,319
hours thinking about my exam tomorrow or
i was thinking about my boyfriend or

886
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:43,529
i was thinking about my cat or whatever

887
00:41:43,529 --> 00:41:45,410
stayin stage adaran

888
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:49,300
that's where you also or will it will
all they've got all sorts of interesting

889
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,259
sleep phenomenal

890
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:51,999
like sleepwalking

891
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:54,220
sleepwalking occurs in stage

892
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,200
and ram

893
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,039
hong

894
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:59,839
we also reporting comes into a forums

895
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,210
but mostly talking actually occurs in
stage and ram

896
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,349
uh... as well

897
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:12,229
why would these people phenomenon stage
and ram

898
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:15,119
concert opera haha exactly exactly right
right

899
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,789
so if you're going to sleep walk it's
got to be in stage n around because so

900
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:22,350
if you're not in because if you're not
paralyzed your of

901
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:25,479
your you're on there that you are your
nodded stage will

902
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,460
sleepwalking is the same way

903
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,410
almost sleepwalking the old fear about
support was a people were

904
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,409
poor talking in their dreams

905
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:35,279
all of that does happen

906
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:40,429
palm abut uh... but it doesn't happen at
that as often as sleep argument stage

907
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:41,509
and ram

908
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:45,200
rather interesting phenomena mental
phenomena stage aramis what's known as

909
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,469
night terrors

910
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:49,509
user very frequently on observed in
children

911
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:52,129
on dr parents quite crazy

912
00:42:52,129 --> 00:42:55,509
or where that they'll put the child
asleep the trouble sleep for awhile

913
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:56,980
bulldog sleeper little while

914
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:00,759
and then the child wake up at the school
read bloody murder

915
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:05,299
will be shivering and sweating and
frightened of all this kind of stuff

916
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:08,839
are will not be able to give any account
of what was going on

917
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,390
all and then the parents will

918
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,339
will build all common public on the kid
down

919
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,680
kiddle go back to sleep

920
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,100
sleep through the night no problem all
will have no memory of the order of the

921
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,039
episode the next day

922
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:23,750
the parents of course remember
everything that wonder if they're

923
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,599
kidder's

924
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:25,690
having some kind of

925
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,390
of uh... some kind of issue so the night
terrors scare the children

926
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,899
during the night but they scare the
parents alone during the day

927
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:34,969
arm

928
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:36,989
mainstage ram we have dreams

929
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,859
and we have nightmares

930
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:40,039
all and then

931
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:41,350
bowl last

932
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,710
is sending stage realm of the night

933
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:47,769
when you're when you're of doable often
experience what's known as a kitten

934
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:48,599
appuram pic

935
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:50,259
reverie

936
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:52,420
just like they have nagata gregory

937
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,209
except you're coming out of sleep

938
00:43:54,209 --> 00:43:55,769
not going in

939
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:57,419
not going to sleep

940
00:43:57,419 --> 00:43:59,630
also there are all sorts of volvo

941
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,549
all sorts of

942
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:04,380
cognitive activities decide sleep

943
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,899
that are going on

944
00:44:05,899 --> 00:44:07,480
sleepwalking is particularly

945
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,259
we're going to do that

946
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:10,450
forget this

947
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:15,069
air sleepwalking quite interesting are
typically random

948
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:19,139
typically of doesn't seem to have any
kind of purpose to what sleep or cripple

949
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:20,599
get out of bed

950
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:25,319
all move around on maybe go into one
room and then come back into the bedroom

951
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:27,859
fiddle with the war knobs and things
like that

952
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:31,289
it's as if the person is kind of a on
automatic pilot

953
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:36,199
are not a lot of all the manual
dexterity on not a lot of affect

954
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:40,709
displayed we know this because we can
bring sleep walker is in the laboratory

955
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:44,499
and before there was radio telemetry
used to hook him up to really really

956
00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:47,559
really long electrode leagues

957
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,689
so they could get out of bed

958
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:54,249
move from one part all above the law got
one for the laboratory are the to the

959
00:44:54,249 --> 00:44:58,259
other now we just hope all the local
como twelve radio telemetry device that

960
00:44:58,259 --> 00:45:00,400
they wear with her pajamas

961
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,559
arms and you can kind of see them doing
this all sleep walking is pretty common

962
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:10,079
in children on that it's also very
common on buffs are very common but when

963
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,930
you observe in adults it's often
observed when bob dole to rims a strange

964
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:15,759
locations

965
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:20,419
all army barracks are good place to
observe sleepwalking when new recruits

966
00:45:20,419 --> 00:45:25,289
or or or sleeping in the new place for
the uh... for the first time

967
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,839
sleep talking or some know what weight

968
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:32,119
well person all of the gauges in speech
makes other kinds of meaningful sounds

969
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:33,619
during sleep

970
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:36,549
not have no memory for this all in the
offer

971
00:45:36,549 --> 00:45:37,950
in the morning

972
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:42,229
again are probably more common in
children are banned in adults

973
00:45:42,229 --> 00:45:46,139
but as i say it we now understand that
there are two different forms of

974
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:47,099
sleepwalking

975
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:52,449
when sleepwalking occurs during around
then that the person on will often be

976
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:53,369
talking about

977
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:58,039
the contents of his or her uh... his or
her dream

978
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:01,569
when sleepwalking occurs in stage and
round

979
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:06,989
there doesn't seem to be any apostle
association with mental contents at all

980
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:08,769
interestingly

981
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:13,619
ram sleep talking has syntax and
semantics it's kind of meaningful speech

982
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,529
you can kind of understand that

983
00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:16,519
we're ready

984
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:21,500
and ram sleep already very closely
resembles the speech volvo phasic

985
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:28,500
of of the patients is cause gotten quite
interesting observation

986
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:40,809
although doesn't you can do this this is
kind of rare

987
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:47,589
by and pick the tickets for the show
infection control laboratory

988
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:51,099
sleep talking's complicated we now
understand that there are some some kind

989
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,930
of the well-read mistake sleepwalking

990
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,749
has some work always of a sleep disorder

991
00:46:56,749 --> 00:46:58,469
part because what's happening a pop

992
00:46:58,469 --> 00:47:01,179
the riddle whole reason you're not
supposed to be able to talking to

993
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:02,969
reinstate around

994
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:08,449
so if you're talking during stage realm
paula it's because the i'll

995
00:47:08,449 --> 00:47:11,560
pros paralysis of the school musculature
is not

996
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,609
as complete

997
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:14,109
as it should be

998
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:18,640
so there's another all-news va the stage
ram behavior disorder

999
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,439
for people will actually act out their
dreams

1000
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:24,749
and again that's a sleep disorder you're
not supposed to be able to act out your

1001
00:47:24,749 --> 00:47:28,069
dreams are skeletal musculature is
supposed to be paralyzed

1002
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:31,649
all of these are conditions are broad
only recently been diagnosed and they're

1003
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:34,119
not very well understood yet

1004
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:38,019
all but the person on campus who wonder
stands the most is allison hardy

1005
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:39,190
appreciate studies from

1006
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,329
arches she studies them for a living

1007
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:43,410
you will often get the farm

1008
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:46,590
all ram august sleepwalking and this one

1009
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:51,800
stage ram behavior disorder inpatients
song uh... with all of post-traumatic

1010
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,229
stress disorder we'll see that often

1011
00:47:54,229 --> 00:47:57,259
called the military veteran what acts
out

1012
00:47:57,259 --> 00:48:03,039
a battle for example industries uh...
made me lash out of his bed partner

1013
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:04,259
has nothing to do with

1014
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:05,469
him or her

1015
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:08,079
home but basically just acting out the
dream

1016
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,019
not supposed to be able to do that

1017
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:13,670
hooded sleepers disordered urine
completely paralyzed so you are acting

1018
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:14,779
these uh...

1019
00:48:14,779 --> 00:48:16,589
that i couldn't stand self

1020
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:17,440
all but

1021
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,890
that's not to say that everybody you
shows this has post-traumatic stress

1022
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:21,949
disorder

1023
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:24,950
anything that screws up this played

1024
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:26,969
home called

1025
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:28,190
though correlation

1026
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:31,329
between what the going on in your brain
and what's going on your skeletal

1027
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:32,010
musculature

1028
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,419
is going to produce these kinds of facts

1029
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:38,899
and again what only just beginning to
understand the stop the stuff

1030
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:43,889
the point of all of this is that there's
a lot more going on during sleep

1031
00:48:43,889 --> 00:48:44,729
mentally

1032
00:48:44,729 --> 00:48:47,609
and behaviorally then jurist

1033
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:50,809
their sleep talking their sleepwalking
there is a nightmare is there's all

1034
00:48:50,809 --> 00:48:55,670
sorts of stuff going on

1035
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:59,609
what happened is that the discovery of
sleep stages

1036
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:03,489
and the discovery all rapid eye
movements

1037
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:07,799
inadvertently distracted people who are
interested in what goes on during sleep

1038
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:12,059
mentally in behaviorally into true dude
trying to put all look at what goes on

1039
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:16,909
with sleep neurologically and
physiologically so sleep research took

1040
00:49:16,909 --> 00:49:22,199
this physiological turn which means that
a lot of these really interesting

1041
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:27,879
cognitive and behavioral effects or only
dawn told me just now getting studied

1042
00:49:27,879 --> 00:49:30,229
fifty almost sixty years now

1043
00:49:30,229 --> 00:49:32,499
after the discovery or walden

1044
00:49:32,499 --> 00:49:36,299
the association between ramen dreamy

1045
00:49:36,299 --> 00:49:39,579
okay our border talked about some
research about sleep or they may be a

1046
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:43,790
fit that in next time palm like the
eyeball fit that it next time

1047
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:46,670
but next time we'll talk a little bit
more about dreams

1048
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:50,599
memory for dreams ads where

1049
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:50,959
thanks very much
