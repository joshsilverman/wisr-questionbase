1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:10,040
okay well let me begin

2
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,919
what i want to do today is to show you a
couple of experiments

3
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:22,159
that paul

4
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:27,060
gives some idea about how we could study
various aspects of cognition

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,330
unconsciousness

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,010
vault

7
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,759
during and surrounding sleep

8
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:35,200
home most of the research on
consciousness and sleep is had to do

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,890
with dreams

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,970
and most of the research on dreams has
been physiological in nature not really

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,270
cognitive in nature

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,710
and most of that has been guided by
what's known as well

13
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,760
v_r_ hobson a mammography aryan model
from sleeping dreaming

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,890
and i'll have some things to say about
that

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,600
on later in the uh...

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,520
in the you know that

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,590
in the lecture

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,459
but for someone to show you a couple of
things about

19
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:00,830
poem

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,839
how we can use

21
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:05,449
the kinds of experimental methods that
i've talked about

22
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,750
in this song in in this class so far

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:13,200
to find out what's going on whether
somebody's asleep world were not

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,790
just as the most artists off

25
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,560
here's our cold early study by will see
web at the university of florida

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,480
in which he simply what people up

27
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,170
between these are subject to risk within
the laboratory

28
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,009
walk mobile come up during the whole
different the home

29
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:28,899
stages of sleep

30
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:30,770
and simply ask them

31
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,240
simple question

32
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,760
have you been asleep

33
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,770
and

34
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,680
alm went

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,960
when he asked a question of people who
are awake they said no

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,369
typically anyway

37
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:45,159
all

38
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,790
in our stage one

39
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,020
all again

40
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,130
these are people who are actually asleep
there's no elf activity in the region

41
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,149
either in descending spit dat

42
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,760
marin of the stage one of sleep

43
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,939
and on

44
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:01,140
they'll often so i was a hug i was awake

45
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,290
palm

46
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,469
ins more slowing sleep stages to three
and four

47
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:08,140
when you wake people up for them they
say yeah i was asleep

48
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,989
but there's a lot of confusion

49
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,020
then this so

50
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,549
in this uh... the stage one whether it's
uh...

51
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:18,290
you descend in stage one as you're
falling asleep or or what we now call

52
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,729
will be no call stage ram

53
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:25,819
palm james wyatt the gradual than a
graduate student are displayed who

54
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:29,279
wanted to use all memory technique
student too well

55
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:33,309
cloud of dust to explore this process of
falling asleep

56
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:36,470
and what he did was to bring subjects
into the laboratory

57
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,440
for all the

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,929
for uh... for them for the person sleep

59
00:02:39,929 --> 00:02:41,180
and while they were

60
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,159
that after they got squabbled in they
got their bottom of electrodes and all

61
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,879
that kind of stuff up

62
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,170
to turn the lights out

63
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,040
and then presented to them over a
speaker

64
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,389
a set of paradiso suits of the forum hot
cold you've seen this before

65
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:56,609
and all

66
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,649
that the subjects were simply instructed

67
00:02:58,649 --> 00:02:59,929
if they heard

68
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,349
a pair of of of of words

69
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,370
simply to repeat it back in there was a
microphone placed on in the bedroom

70
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,439
holland as well

71
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,180
and he did this are the result that with
the word presented

72
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,240
altman and repeated every odd that every
minute

73
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,639
until the subject no longer responded

74
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,799
j presumably the subject is fall asleep

75
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,289
although at that point

76
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:24,909
all of the way up to the subject failed
to respond through the ode to the word

77
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:25,819
pair

78
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:30,029
all he made sure that there was at least
fifteen seconds of alpha pre

79
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:32,129
home uh... do you think

80
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,999
over free g these subjects role in stage
one just because they're

81
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,259
falling asleep

82
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,690
and then he allowed them to sleeping
either four thirty seconds

83
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,540
or for another ten minutes

84
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,189
before awakening them

85
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:45,410
pauline at that point

86
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,450
what he did was to give recall and
recognition toes

87
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,160
and he did this ten time so there's
something which is a particularly cruel

88
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,319
to experiment

89
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,249
you bring the subjects and you tell me
going to sleep in a laboratory in her

90
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,160
wake up every thirty seconds

91
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,209
all world or aural reverie ten minutes

92
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,140
but the plan was to see

93
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,079
all-weather this

94
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,869
item that they've failed through all
failed to repeat so impreza we did not

95
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:12,239
go that did not hear it they were asleep

96
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,389
would somehow world

97
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:15,889
would somehow persist in memory

98
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,789
on these all of them on these recall
recognition

99
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:23,539
now why applauded his data in a very
strange way so don't don't don't be put

100
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:25,199
off by this he like

101
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,560
he discovered a three-d_
three-dimensional graphics program

102
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,489
just wanted to do you think is that
correct

103
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:35,219
i would not dot at this is way ahead

104
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:35,639
alm

105
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,610
but in any about what you're reading
here

106
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,349
these are beyond minutes prior to sleep
onset

107
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:46,280
also appears sleep onset one minute two
minutes and so on

108
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,600
and this is all percent correct

109
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,350
and what we're seeing here all subjects
who

110
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,810
slept were allowed to sleep for thirty
seconds

111
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,090
were allowed to sit for ten minutes
after the presentation of the last word

112
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,199
and here

113
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,849
there's a control group that but mobile
that was tested after thirty seconds

114
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:03,809
being awake

115
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:06,129
or ten minutes on the being awake

116
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:09,789
and what you can see here is if you were
exiled jigsaw up

117
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:12,040
immediately after the presentation of
this word

118
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,650
they're actually able to report it

119
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,210
a fair amount all the time that's about
fifty or sixty percent

120
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,320
or all of the art

121
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,210
of the time

122
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,139
it's not as much as if the move-up items
have been presented

123
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,300
when uh... one when they were awake but
it's still pretty good

124
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,620
but if you will also objects to sleep
for ten minutes

125
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,760
after that

126
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,130
non reported

127
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:33,880
onward pair

128
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,800
then you wake them up

129
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,429
they've got essentially no memory portal

130
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:40,180
here it is all of the results from
recognition

131
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,460
if you present these items when subjects
were actually awake they've recognized

132
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,869
him perfectly well

133
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:47,740
if you'll be allow them to sleep for ten
minutes

134
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,779
above the courier wildness within thirty
seconds you'll recognize it pretty well

135
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,749
not quite as welll as when they're open
it but still pretty well

136
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:59,959
but if you allow them to sleep for ten
minutes

137
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,350
than they just don't have any memory for
this to all

138
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,270
what what what paul why its conclusion
about this was

139
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,110
that palm

140
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,979
what happens is that does this material
is actually getting them despite the

141
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:16,830
fact that the subject is asleep is
unhelpful free stage one on descending

142
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,969
stage one sleep

143
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,080
and it's kind of

144
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,979
city mayor in what you might call short
term were working memory

145
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,400
for at least a little while on the
little while

146
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,479
one up so that

147
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,740
if you're awake and within thirty
seconds

148
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,220
you can recall it

149
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,750
recognized the pretty well but that did
some of them

150
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,790
the just disappears after a little while
decays or something like that

151
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,740
so that if you're awake and ten minutes
after the presentation

152
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,050
all you recall that were recognized with
recognized very poorly

153
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,169
so what's what what what you can see
here is that despite the fact that the

154
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,759
subject does not seem to be

155
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,389
aware

156
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:57,960
of this material as it's happening
otherwise disposed to respond to it

157
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,830
still the travels around eric working
memory arm

158
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,589
a little bit

159
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,289
for a while so it is possible

160
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,749
for something to get the end

161
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:08,989
during sleep

162
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:12,979
falling even if you're not necessarilly
even if you're not necessarilly aware of

163
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,639
it at the time

164
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,319
uh... skip over the was a versace
explosive memory test

165
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,110
and that brings us to the subject of
sleep learning

166
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,449
is it possible for people to actually
learn something during sleep

167
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,620
this is something students of all sorts
of would love

168
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,630
would like to know

169
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,069
not that you guys get any sleep

170
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:33,620
poem but still

171
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,870
the art of the possibility of sleep
learned something that's been around for

172
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,549
a long time

173
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:41,729
and in fact there were a couple of early
studies

174
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:46,339
all of that suggested that it would be
possible for people to all the time to

175
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:47,099
learn

176
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,339
called during sleep

177
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:49,970
put up tape recorder on

178
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,980
but some earphones all under your pillow
or whatever

179
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,139
place something that response to
remember the backstage

180
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:00,419
and you'll actually lorna the firstly
studies was done by all the pioneering

181
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,859
warning psychologist on could delivered
four indyk

182
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:07,609
or during world war one in which
military recruits were trying to learn

183
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,039
more skoda

184
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,180
and what all the

185
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,560
for thorndike did was to record

186
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,560
called of what letter morse code

187
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,910
palm or or the paris

188
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,730
eight years

189
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,539
dot offshore long

190
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,709
be used on to do it if i remember
correctly

191
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,479
called but in any event that's what he
recorded on a record

192
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,729
and then play that basically done that
in the barracks

193
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:34,269
all of the heart of what while these
guys will while these guys were asleep

194
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:37,450
and all but he dint of find was that

195
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,610
there was a nipple monitors sleep they
didn't know anything about how the

196
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,259
monitors

197
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,850
in nineteen sixteen

198
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,760
but what if i was sort of over twenty
pound anyway with some evidence of all

199
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,750
for all of them for learning

200
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,250
all but it turned out calm i thought

201
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,389
whatever was evidence for working there
was

202
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:58,660
boat soldiers were also very fatigued in
the morning

203
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,820
also on led him to suggested either
sleep learning to upload along consumed

204
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,300
a mental energy

205
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,570
or that the subjects that but that the
other the soldiers had actually been

206
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,079
awake

207
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:13,370
on during this time there is also some
hint about surreptitious practice

208
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,440
on the part of these guys but that's the
kind of that's the kind of study people

209
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,610
tried to do

210
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,019
here's little later studied by

211
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,820
fox and robbins again in their young

212
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,730
kind of wartime context

213
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,870
on the cold war of the island of the
nineteen fifties

214
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,060
here it goes thought that subject solo
over trying to learn about

215
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,400
correspondences between chinese and
uh... english words

216
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,600
and they studied these during the day

217
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,400
and then evolve

218
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,209
that though

219
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:45,339
on that night they they got more
practice with these up here is being

220
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:46,710
presented to them

221
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,440
onto the during sleep

222
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,100
and then the next morning

223
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,260
all-day tried to relearn these pairs and
the idea was

224
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,490
that if they could sleep learning is
actually possible then that you want to

225
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,130
show more savings in a real learning the
next morning

226
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,350
all four material that was presented

227
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,460
called direct bite

228
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,550
and all

229
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,220
to look at the turns out that there was
a little bit of evidence in the fox and

230
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,179
robin study

231
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:14,310
all for this here is subjects who didn't
sleep they got music as a control

232
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,429
but as you can see

233
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:16,810
the subjects who

234
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,360
called they've got the presentations and
sleeping morning onto a calm waltham

235
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,080
fewer trials to relearn correct

236
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,860
chinese english errors

237
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,750
called dog prabhu there was one of the
actually interference when they were

238
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,250
morning holland incorrect trying to set
a record of chinese which workers

239
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,640
so these are two studies have suggested
that maybe there was something part

240
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,570
interesting going on here

241
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,350
all simon evans all brass to look at
this although the four the army and by

242
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,439
this point

243
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:49,559
our people it discovered sleep stages
they had discovered a bball rapid eye

244
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,990
movements and dreaming and all that kind
of business

245
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,660
but they had discovered sleep stages and
they had all other stab wish this

246
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,710
criterion that you're not really asleep
unless there is

247
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,489
ono alf activity

248
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:05,760
five in your region that's the standard
physiological

249
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,130
on criterium ralph

250
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,100
firstly

251
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,000
and what's line-item instead was to alba
rug runner study

252
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,160
in which they

253
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,210
basically presented words for subject so
hard to uh... thorne

254
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,290
and while they were awake

255
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,560
in stage one sleep

256
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,520
all with

257
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,030
all hari

258
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,819
medium or low amounts of alpha activity
in the g

259
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:33,959
and then stages to three and four where
there's no wealth activity in the

260
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,560
contingent by definition

261
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,220
and what you can see here

262
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,370
is that all of them

263
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,190
there is pretty good recall and
recognition when subjects or awake

264
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,910
naturally

265
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,050
there is pretty good recall a
recognition when there's a high amount

266
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,559
of alpha activity in the g

267
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,820
costs they're still awake

268
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,279
but as alf activity disappears from the
g

269
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,209
the amount of sleep learning home

270
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:01,370
you limit the amount of sleep learning
progressively uh... diminishes

271
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,640
flows so here is a deal

272
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,480
chargers basically

273
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,060
all of the vote the summary of this

274
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,590
if there is

275
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:13,350
atleast ten seconds of elf activity
after the item is presented

276
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,620
you've got a pretty good

277
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,039
palm uh... all about

278
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,050
uh... likelihood of remembering

279
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,799
if there is no welfare activities

280
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,710
you've got called burberry

281
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,260
very bad very poor likelihood of
learning now remember

282
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,360
alpha activity is the criteria have been
asleep

283
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,130
and the finding of the simon aman study
is

284
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,650
that'd be the amount of learning during
sleep is correlated with the amount of

285
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,740
alf activity in the g

286
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,790
leading to their famous conclusion

287
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,080
sleep learning as possible to the extent

288
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,330
that the subject remains awake

289
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:47,990
palm

290
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,009
sleepless justices support

291
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:54,319
if you're really asleep that there's no
elf activity allies in europe

292
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:55,640
in a region

293
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,209
and that was nineteen fifty five and
that's pretty much

294
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:03,200
although you know that the builders of
the status of the literature uh... today

295
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,100
all

296
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,300
uh...

297
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,580
which apparently does not prevent people
from advertising sleep learning programs

298
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,750
and selling sleep learning tapes and
drugstores and in the back pages of

299
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:19,140
on magazines like psychology today but
it turns out this is one of the great

300
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,580
home

301
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,300
uh...

302
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,139
uh... requests of all time for a bit of
evidence of sleep learning and there

303
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:31,139
just isn't anything marital

304
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,850
yes all of that actually there is
something to that

305
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,470
almost all of the again this is work
done by professor of old walker kiran

306
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,000
did your berkeley

307
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,880
and when it was a postdoc taught at
harvard working with political

308
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,350
and it turns out that

309
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,620
if you've already if you go to sleep
right after you study something you're

310
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,190
likely to remember a better in the
morning

311
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,300
orthologs street seems to facilitate the
consolidation of memories

312
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,300
now i don't go into that much defined by
the

313
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,669
fought about though talking about that i
just don't have time to do it

314
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:18,310
snuggle really relevant to the question
of consciousness during sleep

315
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,960
flown homework over the land or or
consciousness at all but it's a very

316
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,650
important finding

317
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,779
fall having to do with

318
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,300
the on rural science of ball

319
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,220
of all of the form of warning the memory

320
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,300
and walker alan has done the best work
on this

321
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,480
showing that both for declarative memory
like factual memory and for procedural

322
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,440
on memories of the skill learning and
things like that

323
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,570
that various stages of sleep on do seem
to

324
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,680
uh... that

325
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,220
do seem to ah... improve

326
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,170
memory the next day

327
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,529
the and the ideas that

328
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,480
somehow sleeper most of consolidation
process

329
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,220
now there are some puzzles in this

330
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,100
and walker would be the first to
recognize that there are puzzles of the

331
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,260
whole in this

332
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,390
there are debates for example about what
stage of sleep is really important

333
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,160
for consolidation

334
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,450
onstage ram seems to be good for
consolidating some kinds of memories and

335
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,360
stage and read seems to be good for
consolidating other kinds of memories

336
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,410
and up the package doesn't completely
hang together

337
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,030
but the fact that sleep promotes

338
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,580
memory consolidation that is promotes
memory

339
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,190
for things that are learn

340
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,010
when you're awake

341
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,940
is pretty well established now

342
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,260
all but what

343
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,959
slime minuteman diamonds of pointed out

344
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,650
is that sleep doesn't promote
consolidation of material

345
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,470
memory for material for itself is
presented during sleep there just

346
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,510
doesn't seem to be anything

347
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,260
on the anything there

348
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,380
and that as i say that's basically ball
will be what what that literature is

349
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,510
light except that palm they're all good
but there were subsequently though

350
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,390
subsequently a couple of times

351
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,490
all about something and all of you do
more interesting might be going on

352
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,730
all here for example assault with a
little sleep study by called fred

353
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,689
evidence and off

354
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:06,929
that bill work shirt

355
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:09,089
in which they presented subjects

356
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:11,349
with kurt associates of the form

357
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:13,480
eight is for apple

358
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,740
beers four than an hour or whatever
instrument but now

359
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,989
all of that the paris so it's it's

360
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:21,700
while subjects were asleep

361
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,030
this was an palm pilot alpha free on of
alone

362
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,200
phage rem sleep

363
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,380
and i know what the subjects up august
the next day

364
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,640
but instead i was doing a standard
explicit memory test

365
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,770
all insane what were the paris

366
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,140
okay that we presented unto you the the
night before

367
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,220
what evans at orchard did was to say i'm
thinking of the letter or a what's the

368
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,900
word that what's the first word that
comes to mind

369
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,950
i'm thinking of the letter be what's the
first word that comes to mind and lo and

370
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,119
behold

371
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,819
subjects work much more likely

372
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:58,600
to all of the bed to give the word that
that letter had been paired with

373
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,810
the night before

374
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,480
now you'll recognize this as i kinda
priming test

375
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,110
art that somehow i've been presented
without

376
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,920
witham the paris those details for apple

377
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,009
subjects are even more likely than they
would be under base rate conditions

378
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:15,510
to generate apple

379
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,160
as a uh... that

380
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,530
as a free associate

381
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,319
to uh...

382
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,650
hable literary note the date was
nineteen sixty nine

383
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,620
evans in orchard had no idea about the
distinction between explicit and

384
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,690
implicit memory

385
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,260
buddy retrospect we can say

386
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,350
well you know maybe some all maybe all
of that this week when it is impossible

387
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,490
with respect to explicit

388
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:36,890
memory

389
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,100
for the material presented during sleep

390
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,010
but maybe there's something going on
with respect to implicit memory

391
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,320
for material present during sleep

392
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,290
leslie coburn hearing pasqua batch
alguna duda dot they've been a very

393
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,070
similar study level with what

394
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,360
with russian english word paris

395
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,080
all band again

396
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,020
there have been their test all of that
had some of this implicit

397
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,750
fall flavor to it was more like a almost
more like a free association task

398
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,750
than anything else and they got some on
interesting results as well

399
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,130
so those are those results so for
example

400
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,620
of all do that

401
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,240
do the oven tortured one paul first

402
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,060
when these items were presented in stage
rather

403
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,500
you actually got

404
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,669
of notes on the some evidence of memory

405
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,350
but at the other representative stage
tourist age for tourist just nothing

406
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,370
there

407
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,510
holding role both days three

408
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,060
and here's the cooper across garage

409
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,799
arm you present these items and waking
you get pretty good memory

410
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,680
all but if you present them in sleep

411
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,560
the jet better recognition

412
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,970
then you do recall this is or better
recognition than you'd expect by chance

413
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,310
and again recognition can be mediated by
priming effects can be mediated by

414
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,890
familiar respects other at least ends

415
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,610
all in the literature

416
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,630
called that maybe also clinton was
possible

417
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,320
even though the subjects are asleep

418
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,210
as long as you look at implicit memory

419
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,250
which led james one

420
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,530
ought to actually do a formal starting
of explicit and implicit memory for

421
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,630
material presented

422
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,820
on during ordering suite

423
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,900
all he took a l

424
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,700
locally

425
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,570
of that

426
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,580
vote for a while

427
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,780
the ike study on dicom listening that i
talked about a couple of weeks ago

428
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,630
the subjects were presented on the first
night of sleep or with hama phone errors

429
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,440
that is an ambiguous word like peace

430
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,740
all ball paired with a descended you
waiting awards like warren peace

431
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,140
work toward us and hair

432
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,410
and then the next morning

433
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,850
they were simply preserve read these
words

434
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,610
piece

435
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,940
hair or whatever

436
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,919
and were asked to spell them and the
test was

437
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,590
whether of subjects would spell peace
dac as opposed to p_r_ you see

438
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,430
whether they'd the hospital care

439
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,450
h_ a_ r_ d_ as opposed to age

440
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,460
they high are

441
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,869
the next night although hogwood did
something similar

442
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:02,229
he presented subject for parody
associates consisting of a metal on

443
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:09,229
metal and a category that is tube the
word metal or animal horse or whatever

444
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,900
and the next morning

445
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,580
allman palm

446
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,830
call it the would would test memory

447
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,499
simply by asking subjects one think of a
metal what's the first metal comes to

448
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:19,440
mind

449
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,679
i'm thinking about animal what's the
first animal that uh...

450
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,100
that comes to mind

451
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,559
this was an extremely carefully done
starting

452
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,549
all would really pulled out although
stops you read this one minute and study

453
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:32,760
he knew not to make

454
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,130
uh... the usual kinds of of mistakes and
he threw out of the study

455
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,840
any item presented

456
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,670
while the subject was this fence of
leona mostly

457
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,480
that was associated with any body
movement

458
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,820
or any other signs of the part of alpha
activity in the g

459
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,950
so would new

460
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,740
precisely

461
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,490
that the subjects were asleep by all
physiological criteria

462
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,760
all what when the all when the items
home with them

463
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,650
were presented to them

464
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,950
soul again

465
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,539
like yours to recall results from hubble
phone priming when these wanna holla

466
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,530
phones were presented war peace

467
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,440
uh... dog taurus fair

468
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,930
when those low hollow phones were
presented in to some pics of the waking

469
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,240
state you've got a nice priming effect

470
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,310
they spelled the hubble phones in line
with the descent biggie waiting word

471
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,110
the idaho phones were presented when
subjects were sleep you've got nothing

472
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,929
there's absolutely no priming effect
uh... there

473
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:32,610
all at all

474
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,520
here is where we are comparable data for
category instance priming

475
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,330
when you present at the yacht club

476
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,900
her associates two subjects when they
were awake

477
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,710
and so i don't think of a metal what's
the first word that what's the first

478
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,960
metal the comes to mind also gold

479
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,020
what i'm thinking about of all what's
the first walked out of all the comes to

480
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,830
mind allstate worse

481
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,590
but when they're asleep

482
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,180
nothing whatsoever

483
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,039
so there's just no

484
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,419
that's for the of this might have
qualified different results might've

485
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,820
qualified the simon

486
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,220
and admins result

487
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,420
all but they don't

488
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,540
on it turns out that there's just no
evidence role

489
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,210
for anything getting in

490
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,390
when subjects or actually asleep

491
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,150
it might be true that sleep warning as
possible

492
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,970
oh window

493
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,760
thought want to stay awake

494
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,260
but it so it's not true that sleeper as
possible so long as you rely on implicit

495
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,710
as late as opposed to expose of memories
just there's just nothing

496
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,950
and i have to say

497
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,600
but this is a tremendous disappointment
for everybody involved in this study all

498
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,870
above because it really thought it would
be cool

499
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,920
right it would've been very cool

500
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,070
of the the show that there was an
implicit memory for material presented

501
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,750
during sleep

502
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,050
home home via phone it just didn't
happen that way

503
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:48,839
on think

504
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,610
would have effectively killed off this
inquire line of inquiry

505
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,920
there is a paradox here

506
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,519
last week

507
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,909
by showed you some studies that show
that you can get the implicit memory for

508
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:06,140
material presented during general
anesthesia

509
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,049
this week punched telling you that you
can't get that memory

510
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:13,080
for material presented while you're
asleep

511
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,299
why any standard

512
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,869
subjects who were asleep i've got to be
in a better active alert state of mind

513
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:21,780
and people run to replace general
anesthesia

514
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,970
how could we have gotten

515
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,429
priming

516
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:27,970
for mature presented during jut during
general anesthesia

517
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,710
all wed would couldn't get of the
priming for material presented on during

518
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,440
sleep

519
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,950
well the first thing to say as they are
different states you're not just asleep

520
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,259
when you're in s the times of our song

521
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:43,090
i dare not just enough supplies when
you're when you're asleep

522
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,370
but there are also important differences
between the

523
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,750
the the between the effects

524
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,990
all of that

525
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,500
that uh... we got that with anesthesia
and that would go out on what was sleep

526
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,310
that has to do with the kind of priming

527
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,260
in the anesthesia studies all the
studies showing priming during

528
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,010
anesthesia

529
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,760
had made use of repetition priming

530
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,169
repetition priming which can be mediated
by a

531
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:12,820
perceptual representation

532
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,740
of the physical properties of the
stimulus

533
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,289
everyone

534
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,910
of the successful studies of of
prominent anesthesia

535
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,500
have used a repetition priming

536
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,570
no one has ever

537
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,120
succeeded in showing semantic priming

538
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,670
during general anesthesia there's one
case but it's

539
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,110
uh... its fifth

540
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,190
it's not

541
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,670
it's not really

542
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,160
one studies

543
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,390
used by all tell you why it's not right
cuz he use very highly although that

544
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:47,210
does a very high yard the associates all
four colored names and

545
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,850
what what what seems to be in prime and
i think was really

546
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,020
really above base rate adjusted has
pastry

547
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,640
but then the one studies

548
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,340
war is not looking at

549
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,240
repetition priming

550
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,310
he's looking at some magic priming

551
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,520
you can't get priming and humble phone
spelling

552
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,380
or incategory instances unless you
process the semantic relationship

553
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,080
between the two words

554
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,430
unless you recognize that warren peace
or opposite for the title of the polls

555
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:22,400
boyd novel all of us who recognize that
toward us and hair or animals and that

556
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,260
so that's that's the name of it he saw
fable

557
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,249
all you can't get semantic priming

558
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:34,020
unless you recognize the gold is in fact
the metal in animal is in fact the horse

559
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,480
that just doesn't happen

560
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,559
so what you would really like to see if
you really want to nail this down

561
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:43,580
is a study of repetition priming

562
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,559
it might

563
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,710
actually be possible

564
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,640
to get a repetition priming

565
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,559
in helpful freeze sleep but we don't
know

566
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,200
nobody's ever done that study

567
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,730
would went on the other things he never
did that study

568
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,300
palm the heart that any of you ever get
a hold of a sleep laboratory that would

569
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,359
be a very interesting study to do

570
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,100
and it would just kind of all that they
were just kind of

571
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,870
of the make the case

572
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,210
so you can get

573
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,650
private in anesthesia if its repetition
priming but not semantic priming

574
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,220
you can't get priming semantic priming
and sleep

575
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,090
group called the remaining question is

576
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,920
can you get repetition priming and sleep

577
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,720
we just don't know

578
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,389
and that's really all to be said

579
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:28,630
about that yes

580
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,480
yellow i personally would want to call
it implicit perception

581
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,060
all up and the reason i do that is that

582
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,560
there's no reason to think that the
subject is consciously aware of the

583
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,850
presentation at the time it occurred

584
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,010
and i think the best evidence for this
is the

585
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,380
is that it is that study of people
falling asleep

586
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,090
all by james wyatt

587
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:54,480
on bed just not there comes a point to
just don't respond to the word

588
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,880
sold for all intents and purposes
they're not consciously aware of it

589
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,059
you know it's kind of reverberated
around at least for about thirty seconds

590
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,470
and it might be possible

591
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,740
for all for it to be alone

592
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,940
to be at all

593
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,309
subject to some consolidation be encoded
to some extent

594
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:16,590
and be available for an implicit memory
if not an explicit memory but we just

595
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,820
we just don't know

596
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,040
so yeah for the same reason that i think
the peas priming effects during general

597
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,260
anesthesia

598
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,019
reflect

599
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,390
implicit perception

600
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,159
these attacks if you could get them

601
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,110
would also

602
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,749
reflect implicit perception

603
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,210
member right

604
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,440
it's just me

605
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,749
bus not just me

606
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:36,110
allah but

607
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,970
we'd like to think of exported implicit
memory

608
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,850
as referring to cases where something
was consciously perceived and then

609
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,170
subsequently lost a conscious
recollection

610
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:49,570
there's no explicit memory for something
that was explicitly proceed

611
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,889
and for our friends the show and

612
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:52,679
if you could get it

613
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,550
in the case of sleep

614
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,649
as far as we know subjects are just

615
00:27:56,649 --> 00:27:59,380
not consciously aware of what's going on
in the

616
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,640
in the outside world

617
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,399
anther at that point on

618
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,980
what what what unconscious perception

619
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,480
anything else about any of this

620
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,950
there are things that people can do
there're still some mysteries to be

621
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,340
solved in some questions to be answered

622
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,440
on both though

623
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,789
about some of these phenomenal

624
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:25,230
let's spend a little bit of time talking
about

625
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,310
dreaming is clearly something that
occurs while were asleep

626
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,100
all but the real interesting thing about
dot what one of the really interesting

627
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,399
things about dot that uh... about
dreaming

628
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:39,080
is that we know from studies of the
sleep cycle

629
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,690
that we have four or five dreams night
on average because we go through four or

630
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,140
five cycles of sleep you know

631
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,269
average eight-hour audited it hours of
sleep

632
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:53,399
and we know that when you awaken
somebody out of stage where and you're

633
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,720
very likely to get

634
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,170
on dream reports so that shit

635
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,490
run-up percentages

636
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,450
and you can see the people have please

637
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,300
for five dreams and a good night's sleep

638
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,360
we remember at does

639
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,560
only one of those remembers a dream from
last night

640
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,110
carried out of gay not believe that they
are not to remember is more than one

641
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,250
dream from last night

642
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,720
there you go very web that very smooth
very seldom

643
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,590
so what is it that could that dalton
that determines palm

644
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:33,520
all of the bevery on memory for creams

645
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,080
off

646
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,340
we don't know that

647
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,720
but what we know is that there is at
least one

648
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,799
on

649
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,490
when people waken

650
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,429
or go to our awakened out around the
question usually is

651
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:51,609
what was going on with you you know
where you do in anything door you having

652
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:54,559
a dream their various ways of asking the
question

653
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,830
and they say yesterday described their
dream or whatever

654
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,499
people rarely described to a dreams

655
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,639
in these

656
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:03,220
program awakening studies

657
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,860
now would maybe for reasons or show you
in a second that people rarely described

658
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,980
through dreams

659
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:14,660
because the active describing the first
three box the second one out of memory

660
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,190
all but uh...

661
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,140
as far as we know

662
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,809
the one of the general

663
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:24,710
ruled from here as you get one dream for
rent period

664
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,850
and there are studies that

665
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,370
correlate

666
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,130
the length of a person's dream report

667
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,880
with the length of time they spend of
around

668
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,930
and there's a positive correlation

669
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,720
so if you allow somebody to spend a lot
of time

670
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,240
in rent before you awaken them you get a
much longer much more extensive

671
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,250
all of the laws of the dream report

672
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,700
that if you waited owned immediately

673
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,039
the basically are the pace with the
default their but the point is if you

674
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:54,280
have more than one dream for around

675
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,230
the situation for memories even worse

676
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,550
because you've got lots of things that
are

677
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,270
brulee available for uh... for
recollection and you're still

678
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,659
remembering at best

679
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:05,549
only one

680
00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:06,900
or of

681
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,210
we want to die

682
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,770
called how it is upto how does that
happen

683
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,210
okay so here's the problem

684
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,900
there's a high frequency of dreams on
stage ram go through four or five epics

685
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,509
of ramen night's sleep why do we
remember only of low want no

686
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:23,340
one dream

687
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,030
although

688
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:29,440
the general idea here is that we can
think about the dream as occurring

689
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,180
is something like

690
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,220
short term more primary or working
memory

691
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,659
and at that that's kind of the stage on
which the dream is up

692
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:40,100
is played out in

693
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,680
and if you awaken some or did the if you
awaken somebody

694
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,180
during rabah

695
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,020
well the dream isn't working memory

696
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,510
then they can just readout

697
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,700
for u does in the same way that if i
gave you a telephone number and you

698
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,870
won't bulb rehearsed at her work or
whatever

699
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,570
you could repeated back to me

700
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,660
and then what happens is that

701
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,999
all i have to do a good after the
reading period causes all

702
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:06,190
is over

703
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,720
the drillers over

704
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,369
so now what we want to know is

705
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:12,240
on what happens on the consolidation

706
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,340
or holders of the how does that

707
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,300
dream which is occurring

708
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,970
if you will on the stage of working
memory what happens to it permanently

709
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,160
do we get any kind of uh... would get
any kind of permanent and coding

710
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,170
one of these theories basically says
that

711
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,729
there's a lot of them a prominent they
re basically says that

712
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:33,100
there is no consolidation

713
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,070
of the dream

714
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,670
either your awakened up out of the dream

715
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,989
and do you remember

716
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:38,930
that dream

717
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,300
all for a while

718
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,120
or nothing happened

719
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,320
nothing happens at all

720
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,560
and of course of the dreams not

721
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,490
palm stored in consolidated long-term
memory you're not going to be able to

722
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,800
remember in new york in the morning

723
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,389
the key here is

724
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,809
most people when they wake up

725
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,570
they wake up on her brother

726
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,110
when you're when you're in stage ram

727
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,940
you're dreaming

728
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,480
you'll wake up on your dream and that's
the dream you remember basically you

729
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,589
remember the the up

730
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:08,430
the last dream

731
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:08,760
video

732
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,900
of the night

733
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,890
alm

734
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,880
but there are a difficult one studies of
this the film

735
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,059
may seem held few studies have been done
on memory

736
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,340
for dreams

737
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,240
all

738
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,280
though if you think about it for a
second it's listed so i think the kind

739
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,600
of difficult thing to study

740
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,260
what's the

741
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,910
bait what's the from one thing you've
got a

742
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:35,350
if you're going to study memory for
anything

743
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,410
yeah i got i know what the person skills
to remember right

744
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,240
and we have no way of knowing what
another person drains that give pat

745
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,670
absolutely no way of knowing

746
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,050
whether a dream record is correct or not

747
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:50,130
if somebody wakes me up and said more
but what were you thinking about it

748
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,820
there's

749
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,560
dragons riding bicycles argues that no
position to say no we weren't

750
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,179
or that's wrong

751
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,340
or or or or the or or or anything like
that

752
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,389
soul really all we can do

753
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:07,299
is palm but they did a study what people
remembering take that'd face value

754
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:11,029
and frankly that makes a lot of memory
psychologists on

755
00:34:11,029 --> 00:34:13,479
memory psychologist uh... nervous

756
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:17,499
but here's a very nice study by david
cohen at the university of texas

757
00:34:17,499 --> 00:34:19,169
in which he although

758
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:23,149
uh... in which he ought to applaud the
surveyed college students

759
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:26,600
and dog uh... identified uh... college
students

760
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,900
who remember to dream in the morning the
spontaneous memory for a dream

761
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,559
and those who did not remember

762
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:35,649
law young dream

763
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:39,319
brought them into a blood sample of each
of these into the laboratory

764
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:41,180
and uh... just let them sleep for a
night

765
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,810
and they discovered that subjects to
remember dream of the morning are much

766
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:49,019
more likely to awaken i would have stage
ram

767
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:51,480
subjects who do not remember dream in
the morning

768
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,139
are much more likely to awakened out of
stage

769
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:59,419
so again this is consistent with this
idea

770
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:02,619
the that that that dreams are kind of

771
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:06,759
played out in something like working
memory or short term memory

772
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:09,090
and all that you will make them up it
would be beaten

773
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,220
if you awaken

774
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,900
while they're in short term memory

775
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,720
you can recall of just like you can
recall anything else that's in short

776
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,939
term memory

777
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,169
but they have fallen

778
00:35:18,169 --> 00:35:19,789
he thought

779
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:24,219
the the dream is kind of got off that
stage

780
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:24,999
called

781
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,140
here's all

782
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,019
rome

783
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:31,339
here's another of uh... but very very
very similar study the cul winded

784
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:34,190
on he asked subjects when they woke up
in the morning

785
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:37,339
on to do one of two things either when
you wake up

786
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:38,670
don't do anything

787
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,340
just why they're in bed and think about
rather though that i think about your

788
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,289
dreams

789
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:47,349
all or he instructed subjects

790
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:48,789
as soon as they woke up

791
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:53,419
to all of them read the telephone and
dialed the phone dial the weather

792
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:56,609
service for a weather report

793
00:35:56,609 --> 00:36:00,760
this is supposed to be at the
distracting test grade and we know

794
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,250
that any kind of distraction is going to
basically empty the contents of working

795
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,230
for all

796
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,140
for short term memory

797
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,040
and are what you've whether when he
showed very nicely

798
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,589
wasn't subjects were instructed to just

799
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,900
when they wake up just why they're in
think about your dream for a couple of

800
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,390
minutes don't do anything else told

801
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,959
make coffee don't watch television
whatever

802
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:25,749
they were much more likely

803
00:36:25,749 --> 00:36:27,689
to recall a dream

804
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:28,839
palm

805
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:29,389
and all

806
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:30,229
the subjects

807
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:34,500
who won't be nearly got up distracted
themselves by alum

808
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,020
all built by the body are calling for
the weather report before writing down

809
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,249
their dream report are basically were

810
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:42,990
much more like this that you know i'm
sorry i don't remember a dream

811
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,949
on vol

812
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:47,660
this is a kind of finding that's
consistent

813
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,120
with the idea

814
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:54,589
that part of the dreams kind or played
out in short term memory

815
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:56,349
reason we don't remember our dreams

816
00:36:56,349 --> 00:37:01,640
better than we do is that they're not
consolidated their not encoded into hall

817
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:08,640
into long-term memory now and then there
are a bunch of studies out like that

818
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,400
here is a very similar study done by
donald gooden often his colleagues they

819
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,739
had thought

820
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:17,549
customers state university of new york
downstate medical center melvin in

821
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:18,509
brooklyn

822
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:19,470
are here

823
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:25,049
what are the good enough did was to
awaken subjects during stage

824
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:27,559
all and then home

825
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:32,130
on asked them or the at best and whether
they had to do it one hundred report or

826
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,419
not

827
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:34,239
palm

828
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,520
and uh... this is what he called online

829
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,670
called online recalled his immediately
after awakening

830
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:43,269
but what he did he had a couple of
different conditions here

831
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:46,409
in one art that you've been in one
condition

832
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:48,929
the subjects were just allowed to uh...

833
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:51,119
to uh... don't go to sleep

834
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,590
bound to go back to sleep and another
condition

835
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,729
they were on gauged in some kind of task

836
00:37:56,729 --> 00:37:57,889
that kept them awake

837
00:37:57,889 --> 00:37:59,609
all for a little while

838
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:01,220
and what he found was

839
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,920
if you are all kipah i'd with so if you
are kept awake for a little while after

840
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,490
you gave your dream report

841
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,560
you were much more likely to remember it
in the morning

842
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,619
than if you went right back to sleep

843
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,960
so this so-called i'd actually thought
that the presumably date subject kind of

844
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,450
think about their dreams

845
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:22,920
and consciously encode them in long-term
memory

846
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,549
before they went back to sleep

847
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:28,920
the idea here is the reason we don't
remember dreams in the morning

848
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,150
better than we do

849
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,069
is that were not able to engage in the

850
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:34,320
effort full

851
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,140
conscious

852
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,479
deliberately activity

853
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:40,709
that's required in order to encode
dreams in long-term memory

854
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:45,089
the reason why we remember the one read
dreamer remember if we remember that

855
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,869
remodel

856
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:51,729
home because we want to do would be
wrong have to depend on long-term memory

857
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:55,939
dog just read it right out of short term
were all we're working memory so that's

858
00:38:55,939 --> 00:38:57,039
the general idea

859
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,819
are behind that

860
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:01,450
i would not be doing my job

861
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,510
uncomfortable the suggestion stuff

862
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,979
on here

863
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:09,359
all i would not be doing my job if i did
not say a couple of things about

864
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:15,559
the focal pack division synthesis theory
of dreams which is the prevailing theory

865
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,039
why we dream

866
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:22,870
what the nature of dreaming is and why
redial wat wat why we don't all over

867
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,529
remember alone

868
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,349
dreams any better than we do

869
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:31,900
beyond the dat theory of dreams began as
what's known as the activation synthesis

870
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,440
of theory of dreams proposed by uh...
alan hobson

871
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,540
and robert carly

872
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,439
who were working at the moment at
harvard

873
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:43,589
and the general idea behind the
activation synthesis theory was that

874
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:50,110
to remain as a product isn't incidental
byproduct ald cortical activation

875
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,959
that occurs regularly

876
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:53,120
during tonight

877
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,440
as a consequence

878
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,249
of the sleep cycle

879
00:39:56,249 --> 00:40:00,279
remember that when you're in stage one
stage one or stage rem sleep

880
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:05,919
the g_ is showing signs of twelve quite
a bit of god cortical activity

881
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:07,799
and if you're in stages and ram

882
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:10,050
there's less cortical activity

883
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,219
and the idea here is

884
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:16,709
dreams of her home of that as a product
of this quarter collectivity

885
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:18,379
but what happens is

886
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:24,279
that this cortical activation just
activates random memory structures

887
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:27,329
palm the whatever what what whatever it
happens ticket

888
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:29,969
that's for the that becomes a dream
image

889
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,449
and that what happens is that there is
that in some sense the sister of this

890
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:34,360
imagery

891
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,029
into something like a coherent

892
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:39,709
also song

893
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:44,169
form of the debate activations happens
to activated network corresponding to a

894
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:44,890
dragon

895
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:47,219
and a network corresponding to a bicycle

896
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:51,130
you had this dream about drive-ins
riding bicycles down the shahms it was a

897
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,009
or whatever

898
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:54,869
pad that's your brain

899
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:59,689
uh... that space with the idea and the
panda though that the point of the art

900
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:02,619
activation synthesis on along with that
theory

901
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:07,759
be classified these dreams just wrap
with represent the active the accidental

902
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:12,579
activation ald plug dural networks got a
corresponding to various mental contents

903
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:16,509
these dreams are essentially law are
essentially means

904
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:19,209
be hobson mcaro we all

905
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:24,539
no activation synthesis model has been
refined more recently by hobson himself

906
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:26,919
into what's known as the aim of model

907
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:30,130
and again if you're going to see you see
a lot of references to this

908
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,360
all in the literature

909
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,999
which basically says

910
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:34,929
that there are all

911
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:37,009
three different kinds of prophecies

912
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:39,339
that go on and consciousness

913
00:41:39,339 --> 00:41:43,690
these are implemented both at the
psychological level of analysis and the

914
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,230
physiological all level of law

915
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,599
of analysis

916
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,520
first is

917
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,630
what hobson calls cortical activation

918
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,669
which is a product of activity in the
rita killer activating system

919
00:41:55,669 --> 00:42:00,219
or and can be measured by the of the the
rate of which neurons require reading in

920
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:03,089
the best in the in the uh... brainstem

921
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:06,699
and the psychological consequence of
this or the psychological carload of

922
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:07,410
this

923
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,579
is some kind of increased

924
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:12,369
or mortonest

925
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:13,019
then

926
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:15,870
the second part of the physiological
level

927
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:20,620
has to do with what he calls input
output dating agencies activation gives

928
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,900
you the ending a model

929
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,270
input-output dating

930
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:24,959
gives you

931
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,069
the find

932
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:28,919
all part of the model who has to do with

933
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:30,289
has been with input

934
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:32,330
it said look what happens in sleep

935
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:38,259
is that these ponting structures in the
brain stem basically shot down

936
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:40,120
and by virtue of shutting down

937
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,989
the cerebral cortex doesn't get any
input from the external world

938
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:48,450
because all those afferent neurons are
passing through the ponds

939
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,900
moreover whatever's going on in your
head

940
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,520
doesn't get translated into overt
behavior

941
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,989
because all those more signals have to
pass through the pollens in order to

942
00:42:58,989 --> 00:42:59,860
in order

943
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,669
get out of the skeletal o musculature

944
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:04,900
so what happens now is that

945
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,330
walden that women would be sensory motor
channels or blocked off

946
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,710
you're just kind of left with your
internal world whatever your cerebral

947
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,400
cortex is generating

948
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,389
as above at the product by product of
the souls of those cortical activation

949
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:21,620
and then the bien part would be a model

950
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:26,499
all reflects on modulation or what
hobson calls girl modular to rebalance

951
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:28,659
he says again there these two

952
00:43:28,659 --> 00:43:32,629
biggs systems in the brain there's not
the whole system of m interject neurons

953
00:43:32,629 --> 00:43:35,570
to work on nor epitaph brennan serotonin

954
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,329
and then there is a system of

955
00:43:37,329 --> 00:43:40,370
colin urgent neurons to work basically
on uh... on

956
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,629
uh... about under seal choline

957
00:43:42,629 --> 00:43:44,030
and they modulate

958
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,929
all your you word your levels called for

959
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:48,890
although of attentiveness

960
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,160
and so what happens during the night

961
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,349
tough position of the brain with respect
to these three dimensions of

962
00:43:56,349 --> 00:43:57,380
consciousness

963
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,749
physiological dimensions as well as
psychological dimensions

964
00:44:00,749 --> 00:44:02,749
progressively ships

965
00:44:02,749 --> 00:44:04,570
you've got what hobson calls

966
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:08,069
the jama state-space

967
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:10,500
of the portrays consciousness

968
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,180
all the represents consciousness in
basically a three-dimensional model

969
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,299
where you've got activation

970
00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:18,689
going from low to high

971
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:19,689
and you've got

972
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:21,599
the source of inputs

973
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,559
the internal just from your

974
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:24,039
brain

975
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:26,909
or external from the world outside

976
00:44:26,909 --> 00:44:28,319
and then

977
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,520
modulation where there's good got high
levels so i'll bomb nor up annapurna

978
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,020
serotonin

979
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,279
or high levels

980
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:34,869
volvo

981
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:35,989
of the civil court

982
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:39,029
high levels of co of colin urging or an
energetic

983
00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:40,680
all of the modulation

984
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,929
and so he argues

985
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:45,619
in the wake in st

986
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:48,599
you've got higher levels of activation

987
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:49,809
you've got

988
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:54,089
high levels of attentiveness because
they've got high levels of twelve go the

989
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:58,149
co liturgical a activity and your

990
00:44:58,149 --> 00:44:59,449
processing information

991
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:02,509
inputs and outputs with respect to the
external environment

992
00:45:02,509 --> 00:45:03,999
so waking life is

993
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:06,309
apa nak order

994
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:09,320
okay that's that that's what we can
consciousness all

995
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,339
is supposed to be all about

996
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,240
and then as you fall asleep

997
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,929
what happens is that all of this
systematically changes

998
00:45:16,929 --> 00:45:19,969
when you're in stage and around

999
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:22,629
diminished cortical activation

1000
00:45:22,629 --> 00:45:25,390
more of a balance between colin their
gic

1001
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,769
and aman urge ic activity

1002
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:30,250
and for that matter more of a balanced

1003
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,560
between

1004
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,039
external and and and internal or old
sources of input

1005
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:38,660
stage and rent he considered he construe
zones

1006
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,470
degrade the middle

1007
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:46,039
and then when you cycle into stage ravin

1008
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:49,749
you end up down in this corner of the q

1009
00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:52,489
higher levels of activation

1010
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:56,589
all give shifted from high levels of co
undertook activity at the high levels of

1011
00:45:56,589 --> 00:45:59,460
an allergic activity you've cut out

1012
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,490
external sources have been put your
rewind just on what's whatever's going

1013
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:07,109
through all your head and that's where
you dream

1014
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:09,900
but the reason you don't remember the
dream in the morning

1015
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,800
is because

1016
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,789
you've got these that this imbalance

1017
00:46:13,789 --> 00:46:14,979
that favors

1018
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:18,739
all the diameter gic activity as opposed
to corner gic activity meaning

1019
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:20,989
you're not paying attention to the dream

1020
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:23,579
okay if you're not paying attention to
the dream

1021
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:26,899
then you're not going to process that
you're not going to win coded

1022
00:46:26,899 --> 00:46:27,830
on you know

1023
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:28,879
in memory

1024
00:46:28,879 --> 00:46:33,769
so what uh... what god loves a hobson's
dot of the suggests here

1025
00:46:33,769 --> 00:46:38,189
if you think about what the bob what the
nervous system is doing

1026
00:46:38,189 --> 00:46:40,579
during the course of the night sleep

1027
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:44,039
you can explain both why did we dream

1028
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:46,269
we dream because

1029
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:48,469
harbury high st

1030
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:49,909
cortical activation

1031
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:52,009
but we're not getting any information

1032
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,709
from the environment

1033
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:56,319
and why we don't remember the morning

1034
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:01,829
because all this but this neurological
asian basically has prevent has impaired

1035
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:02,819
our

1036
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:03,970
attentional processing

1037
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:10,070
our ability to are to intentionally
uh... in code information and long-term

1038
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:10,579
memory

1039
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:13,690
so the dream is taking place if you will
and short term memory

1040
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:15,550
but no further processing

1041
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:19,439
all is going on that would that would
put it

1042
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:21,389
long-term memory

1043
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:23,320
very very provocative model

1044
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,990
very although they're very very popular
with over with people

1045
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:27,950
in part

1046
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:28,599
because

1047
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:30,330
it seems to achieve

1048
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:35,080
what a lot of people have been looking
for in studies halt to all of the new

1049
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,770
vivid stories of consciousness

1050
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,619
which is a way to relate

1051
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:40,930
what goes on in people's minds

1052
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,669
with what goes on in people's brains

1053
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:45,049
arm

1054
00:47:45,049 --> 00:47:49,299
this is essentially a neural scientific
model of consciousness

1055
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,500
hobson promotes that on though

1056
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,480
as such

1057
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,850
and he argues that

1058
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:57,459
during the night we just cycle

1059
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:58,849
around

1060
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:01,539
various kinds of states

1061
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:02,140
palm

1062
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,109
heavy dreams

1063
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:07,799
when ran this position not having dreams
when or in this position and being

1064
00:48:07,799 --> 00:48:10,829
awakened able to remember that the dog
to attend to

1065
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:14,059
and remember the things that go on in
the external world

1066
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:15,110
or where no

1067
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:15,959
when of

1068
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:19,009
but were in this position

1069
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:22,019
so again the a model ald

1070
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:25,069
hard to do this something that you're
going to see a lot of attention because

1071
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:29,109
of the warm water bro princes to in the
consciousness literature

1072
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:33,140
hobson himself as has argued that it's
essentially a solution to the mind-body

1073
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,049
problem

1074
00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:39,199
all because it shows correlations
between

1075
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,469
going on in the body and what's going on
the line

1076
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:44,129
i think that's probably or reach too far

1077
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,260
to be honest with you

1078
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,859
i think the mind-body problem probably
is going to be more complicated

1079
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:51,289
them not to solve

1080
00:48:51,289 --> 00:48:55,630
but in any event it provides a very nice
way of understanding

1081
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,170
what goes on all

1082
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,620
what goes on and dreams

1083
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,039
why we dream what we do

1084
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:02,559
dreams mean

1085
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:03,049
socially

1086
00:49:03,049 --> 00:49:04,770
no i think they're just

1087
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,259
random accidental activations

1088
00:49:07,259 --> 00:49:09,690
all and why we don't remember them

1089
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,229
better on

1090
00:49:11,229 --> 00:49:11,729
before

1091
00:49:11,729 --> 00:49:12,939
there are some issues

1092
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:15,520
with the a model i don't want to pick
those up

1093
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,999
uh... but i do want to pick those up at
this point

1094
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:19,900
although i do want you to have some

1095
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,369
some exposure to what this model

1096
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:28,989
okay next week we'll turn our attention
from physiological alterations

1097
00:49:28,989 --> 00:49:29,479
consciousness

1098
00:49:29,479 --> 00:49:32,249
the psychological alterations of
consciousness

1099
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:34,149
and we'll look at

1100
00:49:34,149 --> 00:49:34,900
bloody dog

1101
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,449
nature also hysteria

1102
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:39,389
and hypnosis

1103
00:49:39,389 --> 00:49:40,519
thanks very much

1104
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,109
have a good weekend
