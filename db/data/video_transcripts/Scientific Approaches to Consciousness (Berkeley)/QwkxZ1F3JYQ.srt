1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,640
okay one we begin

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,769
last time i talked about tried out of
life the mind-body

3
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:15,619
has to do with the relations between
mind and body

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,279
into four separate problems

5
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,720
and on wednesday i talked about the
first of these

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,509
which is

7
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:24,890
how we get from the body to the mind

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,329
the problem of the new role correlates
of consciousness

9
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,170
what parts of the nervous system

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,350
appeared to be implicated in various
kinds of conscious experiences

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,850
now look what i didn't talk about less
time with the distinction

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,640
that before through david chalmers makes

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,810
between

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,210
although would cause the easy problems

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,590
or maybe he's problems of consciousness

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,730
and the hard problems of consciousness

17
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,660
he characterizes the stuff i talked
about last wednesday essentially as a

18
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,680
newsy probable consciousness

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,880
it's easy to determine that the
reticular formation is associated with

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,980
consciousness or

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,160
that all

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,320
area of the one is associated with
conscious x or seen it

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,530
and uh... area of the four is associated
with

24
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,960
all the experience of seeing color

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,770
but then his points out that there are
that leaves completely on addressed

26
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,510
all problems which he calls the hard
problem of consciousness

27
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,850
uses the singular but

28
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,600
when you read his book to find figure
out

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,049
pretty quickly that there are actually
two of these

30
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:30,759
and of the first one always the one that
victims five actually talks about when

31
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,080
he clutches his head mauldin that
passage

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,750
how do brain processes produce
consciousness

33
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:43,110
how do the operations all nor on the
switches all we've got in the brain

34
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,480
five generate

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,330
conscious experiences mental states

36
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:47,799
farm

37
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,939
the idea that there is something that's
like to see red door be angry or

38
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,020
whatever

39
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,640
and

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,080
none of that

41
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,340
none of that material that i talked
about last time

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,920
dresses dot that mechanism problem

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,580
at all

44
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,219
we might be able to find out

45
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,399
what body parts are necessary for
consciousness

46
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,920
which is what the neural correlates of
consciousness

47
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,429
problem for both

48
00:02:12,429 --> 00:02:14,489
how we get

49
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:16,929
the operation of those brain parts

50
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:21,029
to conscious experiences isn't uh...
isn't at all clear

51
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:24,530
the second aspect of what robbers calls
the hard problem

52
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,620
is off

53
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,060
the problem of why

54
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,620
the brain processes

55
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,979
produce consciousness

56
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:34,899
it's pretty clear their brains process
information

57
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:38,669
that they take information from stimulus
inputs

58
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:40,359
walk around with them somehow

59
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:45,249
and then generate responses to those
stimulus simplex and that's pretty scott

60
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:45,800
clear

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,319
how all of that could happen in some
kind of mechanistic

62
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,799
on the mechanistic

63
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,689
although the west erasers

64
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:54,819
why

65
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,040
this consciousness associated with any
of this why does it at all just go on in

66
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,019
the dark

67
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:01,500
why don't we just operate

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,220
the weight we operate

69
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,950
processing stimuli and making responses
to them

70
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,579
without any kind of conscious experience
at all

71
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:16,399
this problem problem of mechanism how'd
of brain processes produce consciousness

72
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:21,289
i have to tell you does not keep me up
at night

73
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:22,419
farm

74
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,480
that's an interesting question i suppose

75
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,059
but it's a question for the girl
biologists who care

76
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:33,279
just album ilike have any interest in so
i don't talk about it all

77
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:37,969
wind a brain processes produce
consciousness is a little bit more

78
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,809
maybe metaphysical problem

79
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:42,559
why does it all just go on in the dark

80
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:45,730
palm it's probably flooded the intuition
here

81
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,939
is that being conscious has some kind of
adaptive function

82
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,210
it makes a difference

83
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,290
whether all goes on in the dark

84
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,789
all all that goes on unconsciously

85
00:03:56,789 --> 00:04:01,269
or whether as somehow we have conscious
experiences associated with

86
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:06,879
the processing of stimulus inputs and
the generating of respond so please

87
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,200
maybe why doesn't hold just although all
go on in the dark

88
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,049
is a question we might be able to have
an answer for by the time the semester

89
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:14,539
ends

90
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:18,150
but before we can get their i think we
have to find out a little bit more about

91
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,350
what consciousness

92
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,029
what context does

93
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:27,210
so now let's turn to the second all of
these problems of consciousness with

94
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,340
sigmund freud called

95
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,620
the puzzling weep

96
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,129
from the minds of the body going the
other way

97
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:37,120
how do mental states and mental
processes

98
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,689
the functioning all the body

99
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:42,879
and in his up in this case study of the
rat man

100
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,919
all gone before you don't think the says

101
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,039
the same thing the victim stein was
saying accepting his act lee

102
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,400
the end of the freezing it presented
exactly the opposite way

103
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,889
from a mental process

104
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,070
to a simatic innervation the leap from a
mental state

105
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,480
to a bottle we change is something that
can never be fully comprehensible

106
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,150
all to us

107
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,159
nevertheless called we all have balm

108
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:09,670
we all share i think they cards notion

109
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,270
that somehow our mental states do cause
our bodies to be hate in various ways

110
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,109
for one a raise money or i said i want
to raise my arm in my arms build-up

111
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:22,829
there's something something there where
this has been all print all of the bell

112
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,780
but most interestingly i think

113
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,750
the problem of

114
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,409
the affect all of the mind on the body

115
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:32,800
is an area of the is in a medical
literature psychiatric literature

116
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,300
having to do with water called
psychosomatic contractions

117
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,009
and this has it's all about the idea
that somehow

118
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:43,040
mental states can affect disease
prophecies

119
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,979
that on that that in turn

120
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:48,149
affect the operation old-boy of the body

121
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:51,779
again in the earliest all of the in the
earliest history of this

122
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,629
alm the idea of psychosomatic
attractions comes to us mace basically

123
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:56,010
from

124
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,929
freudian psychoanalysis

125
00:05:57,929 --> 00:05:59,169
famous song

126
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,180
uh... psychoanalyst frogs alexander

127
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,740
wrote a whole book all based on author
his ideas about the kinds of mental

128
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,199
states that produced various on
gregarious physical diseases

129
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,849
anorexia nervosa was supposed to be
caused by unconscious feelings of envy

130
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:19,470
and jealousy

131
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,289
and peptic ulcers were supposed to be
caused by unconscious infantile

132
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:24,639
dependency

133
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,419
uh... bronchial asthma

134
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,699
or excessive on resolved dependence on
one's mother

135
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:31,559
calm

136
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,389
hypertension high blood pressure

137
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,930
chronic inhibited aggressive impulses

138
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,409
and what our dive arthritis

139
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:40,909
called was all or was caused by

140
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:43,099
while rebellion of the conflict

141
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:45,750
that instant was when one rebels against

142
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,380
restrictive parental influences me can
kind of see how these kinds of

143
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,449
psychoanalytic stories

144
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,409
disciple of experience worked out

145
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:56,569
here is alexander's ward at all

146
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:57,079
all of them

147
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,319
uh...

148
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,270
detailed formulation for the yeti ology
a pair of peptic ulcer home

149
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,000
we've got this infantile dependency here

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,260
which leads inferiority feelings

151
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,659
which leads to norse assisted protest

152
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:17,099
and that over compensation to become a
big man where a big gone

153
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:21,860
all u_n_ delegation very aggressive
behaviors you feel guilty over that and

154
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,139
all that goes right to your stomach

155
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:27,639
and creates a whole that creates peptic
ulcers

156
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,520
that's the yacht that that's the classic
formulation

157
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,599
and at all

158
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:37,409
with infantile dependency and on resolve
oedipus complex is and all of that

159
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:38,169
palm

160
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,539
and all of that kind of stuff

161
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:46,749
more recently people have tried to
formulate all more modern

162
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:48,379
nonna psychoanalytic

163
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:52,429
fault of the idea of though

164
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:57,560
mental states could cause physical
diseases like alarm michaels

165
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,870
and what you might call modern
psychosomatic formulation

166
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,750
begins with something like the so-called
flights or flight reflex described by

167
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,470
the physiologist walter the famine

168
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,060
all you know it

169
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,429
in nineteen fifteen

170
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:11,800
we know that

171
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,269
when an organism and counters some kind
of stress

172
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:18,039
all the order of correct for the
environment

173
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,120
reacts through that threat

174
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,830
lagi thereby fleeing from the threat or

175
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,979
fighting against

176
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,389
and that calm about the threat

177
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:32,279
with all this is mediated the flight or
fight syndrome is mediated by the

178
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,900
autonomic nervous system

179
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,620
where threat

180
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,310
activates the sympathetic branch of the
autonomic nervous system and later on

181
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,890
the parasympathetic branch kicks into
marginally

182
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,620
though the sympathetic uh... arousal

183
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,440
and all the i don't know when you can
see it over here but

184
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,990
it's true anyway

185
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,840
palm that

186
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,010
for example all the synthetic nervous
system

187
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,929
for the sympathetic activation

188
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:58,180
has a whole bunch of

189
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,860
physiological or of that

190
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,200
physiological consequences one of which
is three and a hip

191
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,650
on digestive secretions

192
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,180
alm

193
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,670
uh... and dog that uh... if your

194
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,900
exposed to prolonged stress of course
that cat last very long you're starting

195
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,680
to consume blood sugars and things like
that

196
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,860
so your

197
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,850
starts working again start secretly
digestive

198
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,680
of on the fluids

199
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,110
to going to get more blood sugar into
the body

200
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,369
but there is nothing there to digest

201
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:32,029
and so gastric acids instead of eating
away at your hamburger rear speakers bar

202
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,779
eat away at you were at that that your
stomach lining instead

203
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,640
and that's what creates ulcers

204
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,110
so you don't have to have a whole new on
resolving dependencies on your mother to

205
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,100
get all service

206
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,199
all you got to do

207
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,720
is to be exposed

208
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,910
prolonged fred

209
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,040
and that's the general

210
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,459
one of the general all the way

211
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,600
most of these all modern psychosomatic

212
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,830
ideas or or college

213
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,720
so all of that can be summarized in what

214
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,120
sheldon cohen and others have called the
stress disease connection

215
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,610
where exposure

216
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,090
to psychological stress in one form or
another

217
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,930
all probably chronic psychological
stress may be a cute certainly chronic

218
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,769
sought

219
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:16,040
includes no no

220
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,720
to increase on people's risk

221
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,070
four various kinds of diseases

222
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,490
and some of these are

223
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,980
so-called mental illnesses like
depression

224
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,509
but also it turns out

225
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:30,949
that exposure to chronic stress
increases a person's risk for various

226
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:32,570
so-called physical diseases

227
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,689
like cardiovascular disease

228
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:38,429
extra chronic stress increases your risk
for proper car various kinds of

229
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,870
cardiovascular disease

230
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,100
all by about fifty percent

231
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,490
palm

232
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,940
there's actually a evidence now that
exposure to not everybody who has h_i_v_

233
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,559
infection

234
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,930
gets ames

235
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:57,260
all but it turns out that poem maybe if
you've got h_i_v_ infection and you are

236
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,180
exposed to to chronic stress

237
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,589
buster keaton increases by about fifty
percent

238
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:04,650
uh... the likelihood of progressing

239
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,250
from h_i_v_ aids and

240
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,640
increasing risk for all sorts of
complications

241
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,539
and there's even a little literature

242
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:13,830
on lovers not is convincing

243
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,400
all but there is a literature

244
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,730
that suggests that called old chronic
stress levels

245
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,110
or related to uh... increased risk for
cancer

246
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,109
the evidence for this don't do these
kinds of experiments in the laboratory

247
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:27,219
right we don't

248
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,649
expose people to chronic stress from an
infected with h_i_v_ and see if they get

249
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,780
a

250
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,550
all but

251
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,340
they resolve that

252
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,080
they're all you do is lots of evidence
for what you like all natural experiment

253
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,770
for beacon do have to be a logical
studies

254
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,139
measure stress levels in various ways

255
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:47,960
and then look at the correlation between
of the between stress levels

256
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,010
and various kinds of various aspects of
disease

257
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,190
either the onset of the disease

258
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,250
or the progression of the disease how it
develops

259
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,790
or the recurrence of the disease once
it's been treated complications from it

260
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,760
star stress seems to be involved in the
whole of these kinds of things

261
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,480
and we now know something about how this
is mediated now this is not a physiology

262
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,300
class so we got to go over this really
lightly

263
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,600
but it turns out

264
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,270
that there is what's known as the h_ p_
a_ axis the hypothalamic pituitary ugly

265
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,480
a portable

266
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,460
our taxes all seems to mediate a lot of
these are stressed disease connections

267
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,520
so that

268
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,850
when you're algo under under stress

269
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:33,260
the hype a palace releases are critical
problems releasing factor itself

270
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,390
probably substance

271
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,090
which affects the pituitary

272
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,860
uh... which releases the virus substance
which affects the adrenal glands which

273
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,310
supreme court us all and we know that
cortisol has a wide variety of

274
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,790
oval of affects

275
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,710
bodily function

276
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,430
similarly

277
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,250
there is yet another axis here known as
a sympathetic adrenal medullary axis

278
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,670
although the consequence of activation
of the sympathetic nervous system

279
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,880
although there are catecholamine summer
release

280
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,420
on that have hall all sorts of affects

281
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,340
on all sorts of barnali on the system to
the idea of your wrist

282
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,290
that it's either by virtue of the h_p_ a
axis

283
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,980
or by virtue of the essay on maxis

284
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,730
affects small

285
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,700
as medical effects on the body

286
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,189
and produces

287
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:22,400
produces the stress disease

288
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,160
so the physiology of this is beginning
to work a bid to be worked out

289
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,330
all what's not

290
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,470
always been claire unfortunately is what

291
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,710
is meant by stress

292
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,780
all walter buchanan that's him up there

293
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,790
island actually

294
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,780
the term stress you wouldn't know that's
the term stress is actually quite recent

295
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,320
on he didn't used rescues

296
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,480
all but they love the bug dog of the
cabins idea of the flight or fight

297
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,019
syndrome paula is really

298
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,410
really implies the concept of stress

299
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,010
though the idea of stress was first
introduced by all british all of the

300
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,880
position hans ellie

301
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,190
on nineteen thirty six

302
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,090
i need to find his any but in any event

303
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,620
the challenges on organisms current
level of physiological or psychological

304
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,310
adaptation

305
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,180
which sounds like a really good position
if we try to figure out what it means

306
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,970
physiological or psychological
adaptation

307
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,490
are celery all of the better for the
distinction between positive and

308
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,570
negative stress

309
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,380
distressed which is negative and you
stress

310
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,620
which is positive

311
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,809
and he makes the point

312
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,660
they're getting married

313
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,070
pretty much as stressful as getting
divorced

314
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,170
so i had a good bit adjusted just
because all sorts of good things are

315
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,429
happening to you

316
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:36,039
doesn't mean

317
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:39,080
uh... that europe that you're not under
stress

318
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,090
fall there all the even positive ads can
challenge your current level of

319
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,010
physiological or psychological
adaptation

320
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,460
sheldon cohen at carnegie mellon
university is really kind of the king of

321
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,050
stress of disease

322
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,990
these days

323
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,140
and he's defined all of the stress as
the

324
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,739
although the perception

325
00:14:56,739 --> 00:14:58,959
that environmental demands tax

326
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,960
or exceed

327
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,830
the organisms adaptive capacity

328
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,440
probably as good at

329
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,600
twelve general conceptual definition
stress

330
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,110
as a as you can find

331
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,190
there's this whole literature out there
about stress and disease

332
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,560
fortunately on this is a literature that
drives most physicians crazy

333
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,830
all and they have been got got a gun to
some lengths to try to get rid of it

334
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:30,790
the idea that mental states could cause
bodily functions is not something that

335
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:35,200
modern medicine really likes very much
because they want to know all about

336
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,220
viruses and bacteria and all of that
kind of stuff

337
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,660
physical states that cause

338
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,629
uh... but close though

339
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,140
cause disease

340
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,220
home

341
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,240
and here's the good example of this

342
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,740
this is work by marshall and warren

343
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,680
or to australian oppositions they've won
the nobel prize for the first couple

344
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,810
years ago

345
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,440
who discovered

346
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,810
fog that at all people who had the
pollsters all were highly likely about

347
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,170
eighty eight percent

348
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,160
of patients with with law

349
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,800
all of that with all sorts

350
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,730
were infected with a particular

351
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,890
new form a bacterium

352
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,970
all called off helicobacter pylori light
age

353
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,850
uh... each pile or right

354
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,660
so this is all from there

355
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,230
or bridgeable study

356
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,269
eighty eighty eighty five ninety percent
of people with all service

357
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:24,960
had which by law right all over their
gods

358
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,279
people who just had gastric inflammation

359
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,780
much less likely

360
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,039
people of problems with called excessive
liver bile

361
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,429
a less likely

362
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:37,459
and patients who complained of
gastrointestinal problems but that prove

363
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,330
normal lung biopsy

364
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,000
hong

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,230
though again had

366
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,740
much reduced level called palm

367
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,279
became law right

368
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,929
infection leading all of them uh...

369
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:52,759
marshall and warren to conclude

370
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,210
that caught it's age high low right
infection that causes ulcers

371
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,379
okay so that's a physical condition

372
00:16:59,379 --> 00:16:59,750
causing

373
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,620
a physical condition

374
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,780
leading

375
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,410
although steven hyman who was then the
director of the national institute of

376
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,110
mental health

377
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,520
an essay entitled another one bites the
dust

378
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,890
the time-honored attribution obsessed
symptomatic ulcers to stress alone

379
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,970
may result from a

380
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,990
theory driven retrospective
falsification

381
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,279
on that is one of those workers are
looking up the through the person

382
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,190
and you can always find some kind of
stress

383
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,050
getting married can be a stressful is
getting divorced than everybody's under

384
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,030
stress

385
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,650
all the time

386
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,129
applying to college can be stressful
getting into college can be stressful

387
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:42,680
graduating can be stressful all gone you
can always find stress

388
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,870
stress on the perception of stress are
notoriously difficult to define with any

389
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,420
precision

390
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,070
all basically goes on all your name in
this essay to say

391
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:57,320
that progress in psychiatry in the field
of mental health in general will will

392
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,929
occur

393
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:02,290
two of the expect that we get randolph
mental talk

394
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:08,190
and start talking about biological park
so what we want or we search for are the

395
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,110
biological basis of various mental
disorders

396
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,530
and develop all done at the biological
methods one brainstem brain damaging

397
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,180
form for diagnosis

398
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,250
and developing biological cures

399
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,700
like uh...

400
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,120
like medication

401
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,430
hyman's

402
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,220
or that's him or outright there'd be a
great after he left on their image

403
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,499
became the provost of harvard university
so visa guidance

404
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:34,770
pretty powerful

405
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,529
on you know

406
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:37,910
medical field

407
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,650
here's our good example all bottom of
all the historical trend of the

408
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,150
twentieth century that you might want to
call the biologists nation of mental

409
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,150
illness

410
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,139
which begins

411
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:52,309
with this wonderful quote from ralph
gerard zone uh... famous physiologist

412
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:57,920
behind every twisted fought there lies a
twisted molecule

413
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,570
plan dog thomas install boost the
current

414
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,870
director of n_r_a_ image

415
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:06,770
has no has written of recent paper in
melbourne inside of american

416
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,010
in which he says no row imaging has
opened up the black box for the brain

417
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,899
so that mental disorders

418
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:15,080
candies the studied for the first time

419
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,410
as abnormalities in brain connections

420
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,660
the idea that mental states comfort
nothing arbatov of the psyche counts for

421
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,460
nothing

422
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,809
that old mental illness is off

423
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:28,560
is brain disease

424
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,140
and we can see this

425
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,590
alm

426
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:36,220
we can see it all this solved but that
kind of thing towards buyers biology

427
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,059
station

428
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,100
lots of different aspects of the current
field of mental health

429
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,830
the idea of mental health mental illness
is construed as virological disorders

430
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,600
it's been it's gone now

431
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,910
so don't look for it

432
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,720
but it used to be there on the and i a m
age website

433
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,309
there was a off the headline that said

434
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:56,040
depression is a real nice

435
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,090
and the reason what they what they meant
by that was depression was a real

436
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,630
miller's because people with more
depressed

437
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,840
have brains to look different don brain
scans

438
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,330
people who don't have depression

439
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,840
as if the pression wasn't the real
illness before

440
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,050
frame images

441
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,830
so modern psychiatry ten super for
biological explanations over

442
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,930
psychological explanations for various
kinds of mental disorders

443
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:25,770
they tend to produce prefer biological
treatments over psychological treatments

444
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,730
all and in general

445
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,789
all positions of all times

446
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:34,090
tend to discount the role of
psycho-social factors

447
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,660
indices and its treatment and it's
precisely those kinds of psycho-social

448
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,980
factors

449
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,289
generate issue here but we want to talk
about

450
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:43,290
how the mind affects the body

451
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,799
the burial label psycho somatic illness

452
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,630
implies that somehow the person's mental
state

453
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,450
affects

454
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,059
on his or her

455
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:53,519
physiological

456
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,380
on function we're not talk about raising
your right arm anymore

457
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,100
we're talking about how your mental
state can affect

458
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,640
something interesting inside your body

459
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,140
so anyway all

460
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,810
the all of the discovery of h pile or i
seem to ah... put the last mail in the

461
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,720
coffin

462
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,280
of the psychosomatic account of all
service

463
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,470
ulcers are due to

464
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,719
bacterial infection

465
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:18,350
rather than to any kind of stress

466
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,670
until people started looking at this all
the

467
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:26,970
more closely herbert wider recently
deceased fellow long-time of

468
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,320
medical psychologist at u_c_l_a_

469
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,040
pointed out that yes it's true as
marshall and warren discovered

470
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,880
that virtually everybody who has peptic
ulcers is infected with age

471
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,000
by law right

472
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,990
but it turns out

473
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,100
everybody's in fact at the page five oh
right right

474
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,840
on and it's not the case that our word
that we all have also received resulted

475
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,910
not everybody is infected with h_i_v_ or
aids suffers from peptic ulcers

476
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,049
you can do survey of also free control

477
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:55,860
our people

478
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,480
not patients who had gastric problems

479
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,210
as warranted marshall did

480
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,899
what do all of population

481
00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:02,960
all sort of a

482
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,650
and you can find or age by law right
infection in about eighty percent

483
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,360
halt all through

484
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,300
all free controls

485
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,210
on normal whiter in fact estimated the
roughly half the world

486
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,059
had are clinically significant levels of
infection

487
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,920
with each pyloric

488
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,620
suggesting that

489
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,530
age by lori infection might be necessary
for all sirs to occur

490
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,310
what it was insufficient

491
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,730
all and implying

492
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:31,430
that what you really paul need to have
is home

493
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,570
is often have something else may be of
some kind of psychological factors

494
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,710
here's the kind of data people talking
about this is a popular this is laid off

495
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,299
broom result of a random sample global

496
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,440
their patients

497
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,140
signed the world all

498
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,150
stations of gastric ulcers

499
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,790
and uh... thoda good carefully matched
controls

500
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,870
patience with the one lol ulcers

501
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,220
and carefully matched also free controls

502
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,139
and on

503
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:01,740
because did concede that

504
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,920
while it's true

505
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,940
that patients with ulcers are more
likely to have each part laura infection

506
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,770
the control patients are also extremely
likely

507
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,130
that had exploring infection

508
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,690
suggested again

509
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,070
appalled that this is that this is an

510
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,300
that they'd camel rides

511
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,030
may be necessary but isn't sufficient

512
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,550
all but one response this is all

513
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,019
bruce over my ripping university of
minnesota

514
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:29,640
and robert bristled at the university of
very good

515
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,180
and uh... in norway

516
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,720
all i have uh... produced of

517
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,570
evidence for what they call a nice

518
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,900
also called by apus the stress model
parole sirs

519
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,029
by apple so stressed models and and and
medicine

520
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:46,750
argued that any particular episode of
disease is a product of the interaction

521
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,940
of two factors

522
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,010
dialysis factor

523
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,450
which were renders a person former will
piss on disease

524
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,049
and a stress factor

525
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:57,299
which precipitates thank you

526
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:57,570
song

527
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:02,710
uh... that that the silk in but but only
in not invulnerable patients

528
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,159
and so they argue

529
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,139
that called

530
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:08,490
that over myron morrison argue that
stress

531
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,620
dot just as in the modern psychosomatic
model

532
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,570
secrete gastric acid into the stomach
amak gastric acid the roads to stomach

533
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,500
lining

534
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,810
and because all solution

535
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,720
h_ pylori infection increases a person's
vulnerability

536
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,510
to disarm rogen process

537
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,660
but doesn't create gastric ulcers hong

538
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,280
all all by itself

539
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,519
and if that's the case

540
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,520
then you have at least two different

541
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,510
ogle option

542
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,490
for treating

543
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:41,159
on gastric ulcers u_p_s_ give the person
an antibiotic like a rented ratcheting

544
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,700
which attacks age by were right

545
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,860
do something psychological

546
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,520
of like bom

547
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,690
put the person through what some kind of
stress reduction

548
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,210
so what's the evidence for this

549
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,010
all over myron morrison actually dug
developed evidence for this in a

550
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,470
i'll have a role model

551
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,549
all bolsters

552
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:04,080
they're not going to go out and pick a
random sample of college sophomores and

553
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,269
in fact there do you know i systems with
age pylori amend subject them to

554
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:09,670
lots and lots of stress

555
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,230
they did this and rats

556
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,020
are born and raised in the yard in in
the lab so they're either free image

557
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,930
pylori infection

558
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,260
or at least called

559
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,150
uh... that they were randomly assigned
to conditions

560
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,620
uh...

561
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,640
regardless of the rich for lawrence

562
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,240
and we know that there is a there's an
experimental technique

563
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,640
are called restraint and water

564
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,870
hard every water blueprint of produces
gastric ulceration

565
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:36,909
uh... in uh...

566
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:37,690
in rats

567
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,050
what you do is to put the all of them
put the out a little glass to

568
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,950
and then you stick the glass children

569
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:48,929
and the animal doesn't drone or anything
like that but they don't like it at all

570
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:49,960
and uh... what what what

571
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,730
when when you well and you wouldn't
either

572
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,580
farm

573
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,890
fala and dog but what happens is the
start their technique reliably produces

574
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:00,990
gastric ulceration

575
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,380
all of the day

576
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,900
substantial percentage of rats

577
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,320
who are treated with this restraining

578
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,100
they'll develop ulcers as a result of
that

579
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,250
and here's the first entry point

580
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,770
or we have to rack is conscious while
it's restrained in water

581
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,919
do you get up to do you get all sorts

582
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:20,860
that's a very cool fight

583
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,720
so if you anesthetize the rat

584
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,929
stick them in the tube stupid to water

585
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:27,210
over too well look at the rat

586
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,690
noel sort

587
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:32,070
but if the rats conscious while this
whole goes on that's when it gets

588
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,390
holsters

589
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,990
also wotol or immersed in bed

590
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,280
was to of the based on the heart of the
phenomena which some of you all of you

591
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,760
took psychology one and shorter familiar
with the phenomenon called learned

592
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,060
helplessness

593
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,200
which occurs when

594
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,320
organisms whether they're rats are cats
or dogs are recruitment

595
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,429
are exposed to uncontrollable

596
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:54,900
on shock

597
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,489
that is

598
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,419
they just get shocked that there's
nothing they can do about it that

599
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:02,180
induces a psychological state known as
word helpless

600
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,750
and what over myron morrison dead ones

601
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,729
before their animals were put in this
restraint of water treatment

602
00:27:07,729 --> 00:27:12,919
they got prior stress treatment by being
exposed to both uncontrollable

603
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:14,160
and on predictable

604
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,789
all uh... for chuck in various

605
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:17,279
combinations

606
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,570
so they've got

607
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,910
exposed uncontrollable and unpredictable
for choc

608
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,850
them they were given the restraint of
water conditions

609
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,940
and papa and then all of you know that
they've looked at the whole ulceration

610
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,940
let me get results like this

611
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,970
here are animals

612
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,450
this is the amount of ulceration

613
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,540
so you've got out of those who just got
restraint and water

614
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:44,080
your animals several of exposed to
unprofor uncontrollable shock

615
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,360
bombardment of controllable shock

616
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,839
so there's a big increase and alteration
of the animals who had prior exposure

617
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,640
to one controllable shock

618
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,890
here's another experiment

619
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,300
restraint of water only

620
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,370
here are animals that were are exposed
to

621
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,570
uncontrollable and on predictable shock

622
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,770
big increase of ulceration

623
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:06,690
and your animals route response or
exposed to

624
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,510
uncontrollable both predictable shock

625
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,309
and also

626
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:10,539
a big increase

627
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:12,650
you know in northridge

628
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,580
here and you have clearer

629
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,419
evidence although causal effect of
stress

630
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:20,679
on all serbs this is not due to age pile
all right

631
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,179
press for the first place these rights
don't have aged by law right it even if

632
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:25,820
they did there's a random

633
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,000
of employment of animals to conditions

634
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,410
each per lori infection is spread across

635
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,030
all the young

636
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,850
hold the uh...

637
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,610
conditions of the experiment

638
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,470
so if you can if you except

639
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,490
an add'l model for human disease which

640
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,710
most biologists part of it

641
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,620
too

642
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,070
on here is

643
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:53,050
clear evidence floor causal affect of
stress

644
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,019
of them very nice

645
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:57,120
demonstration of the psychosomatic
effect

646
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,630
i'll skip those

647
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:06,179
the experiments like this give us a
followed by a very nice way to

648
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:07,890
operationally define

649
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,620
psychological stress if you look at
those classic definitions you know

650
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,630
perception of retin challenge though i
had to adaptation

651
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,440
they are as hyman point as hyman out of
the crash site

652
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,560
kind of a

653
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,600
but in these kinds of experiments

654
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,209
all redefine stress

655
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:25,240
as open as a sort of circumstance

656
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,320
where salient events or unpredictable

657
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,020
were on controllable

658
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,620
and think about these in terms of

659
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,770
kind of animal condition experiments

660
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,710
and classical conditioning animals are
trying to predict

661
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,500
the occurrence of up on condition
stimulus

662
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,290
based on the condition stimulus

663
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,859
instrumental conditioning animals are
trying to predict

664
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:47,909
the occurrence of reinforcement

665
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:50,580
based on a conditioned response

666
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,490
those so-called helplessness experiments

667
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,120
animals can do that

668
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,900
on condition stimulus for the
reinforcement

669
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,379
either unpredictable

670
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:02,470
or uncontrollable

671
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,750
and the point of all of this is where do
you think about it for a second

672
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,289
or unpredictability in on
controllability our mental states

673
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:11,990
they are beliefs about the world

674
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:17,070
i can't predict what's going to go along
i can't control or what's going on

675
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:21,440
they are about something although in the
world their mental states and to the

676
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,220
extent

677
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,960
called blood these mental states of
unpredictability and uh... on

678
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,110
controllability

679
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,700
all going to create a background against
with although against which ulcers can

680
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,150
occur here you have

681
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,730
these are the mental state

682
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,540
that is causing andy allen a cinematic

683
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,760
uh... the state

684
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,090
on mental state

685
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,299
possible this were disease

686
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:48,490
these classic psychosomatic affects

687
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,990
are one domain

688
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:55,400
in which we can study the effects of the
mind of of mental mental state

689
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,740
on the body

690
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,870
here's another one

691
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:00,530
all what's known as the placebo effect

692
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,879
all which is defined as

693
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:03,590
any treatment

694
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,410
forum illness which does not which is
not specifically affective for that

695
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,559
illness the so-called sugar pill

696
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,070
and we can to find the placebo effect is
arthur shapiro did

697
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,680
as the nonspecific

698
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,810
psychological or cycle physiological
effect produced by a placebo

699
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,210
and the placebo effects of sometimes
been called

700
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,559
the jewel in the crowd of psychosomatic
medicine

701
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,539
because everybody

702
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:31,869
uh... a things while that stuff

703
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:34,070
placebos song

704
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,059
have an effect various disease processes

705
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:38,919
placebos

706
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:39,929
always entail

707
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:41,350
bell boli

708
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,400
that person is that that the person is
taking

709
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,519
overdose on active

710
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:50,610
on kind of drug that's what that's worth
reported both start

711
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:55,230
and again becasue placebo effect this is
something that many many physicians want

712
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,980
to get rid of this quickly if they can

713
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,080
again because

714
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,440
physicians like to have biological
treatment

715
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,919
for physical illness they don't want to
have psychological treatments

716
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,860
for physical illness

717
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,539
and the two european our investigators
are probing arts and culture

718
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:15,639
uh... been a very provocative of the
study

719
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:17,059
a couple of years ago

720
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:21,700
in which they denied that in fact there
were any placebo effects

721
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,280
which is quite interesting

722
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,110
although and they've been hearing on
which which really

723
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,349
it is very important

724
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:30,539
all goes as follows

725
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:34,760
placebo effects they are going to come
up against the standard clinical trials

726
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,070
for drugs

727
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:39,710
if you're a drug manufacturer and you
want to do a drug or that you want to

728
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,019
show the f_d_a_ the food and drug
administration

729
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:47,510
ventured roadworks or what you want to
do is to take two groups of patients

730
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,560
give one random though randomly assigned
them to

731
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,230
the drug war to a placebo

732
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,980
phone

733
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,429
and all you can get your drug approved

734
00:32:56,429 --> 00:32:57,010
on if

735
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,890
the june opec to the drug is greater

736
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,080
a placebo

737
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,639
and that's a fall

738
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:05,809
drug manufacturers usually do

739
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:08,020
they have to conditions of their
experiments

740
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,179
the active drug

741
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:12,100
and a placebo order that condition

742
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:12,530
called

743
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,230
and uh... there'd their content to show
and for that matter the f_d_a_ is

744
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,980
content for them to show

745
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,090
that of the drug

746
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,120
works better all of them in the uh...

747
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,910
than the placebo

748
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,690
but probably arts and got shipped all of
them said they did well

749
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,370
okay

750
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:30,930
and within three minutes talk alike that
you can see you can show that

751
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:35,370
the of the placebo all of the heart of
the has some affect on the disease

752
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,570
process

753
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,580
but you don't really know

754
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,670
the magnitude of the placebo effect

755
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,030
unless you include

756
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:47,150
eight third condition and your
experiment which is of no treatment

757
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,650
control condition

758
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,159
the placebo condition

759
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,580
it's a control freak a placebo effects
of the drug

760
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,230
but you don't know what the placebo
effect of the drug is unless you've got

761
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,210
another group of patients and don't get
anything

762
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,960
and nobody does that

763
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,260
in drug trial

764
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,740
why would you

765
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,109
all your asked although you're being
asked to show

766
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:13,839
is that your drug is better than a
placebo so you're not going to go to the

767
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,549
expense

768
00:34:14,549 --> 00:34:16,440
volvo of the producing

769
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,840
no treatment control so what you really
need if you're going to show that you're

770
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,919
going out the all look at the magnitude
of placebo effect

771
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:26,749
you've got to be able to do three
analyses

772
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:27,609
comparing

773
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:30,450
the drug treatment for no treatment at
all

774
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,969
you get what's known as the drug effect

775
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:38,429
that is the advantage of the drug over
doing nothing

776
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:38,809
second

777
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:42,649
you want to look at the magnitude of the
drug affect

778
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:45,889
compared to the magnitude of the placebo
effect

779
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:50,060
that difference is known as the specific
aspect of the drug

780
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,199
whatever that is

781
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,359
but by the same logic if you want to
know what the

782
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,759
if you will the specific aspects of the
placebo is you want to be able to

783
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:00,430
compare

784
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,940
the placebo

785
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,069
what happens when people get a placebo

786
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,150
to what happens

787
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,010
when people

788
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,390
get nothing now why would you do that

789
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,890
well because the medicine we note that
there are lots of cases of spontaneous

790
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:15,909
remission you get a cold you wait long
enough to goes away

791
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:18,880
to get a pain to wait long enough it
might go away

792
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,890
hard to get high blood pressure rio

793
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,750
just sit there for a while and that
michael way through

794
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,449
you've got to know what happens when
people

795
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:30,109
so what robertson and got your dad

796
00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:34,949
was to sunday p available medical
literature and find a couple of hundred

797
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:35,330
studies

798
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,179
which had all three conditions

799
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:41,409
a permit him to evaluate the drug a fact

800
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:43,199
the specific a fact

801
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,439
and the placebo effect

802
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:47,539
the postal the placebo effect being

803
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:49,779
the difference in outcome between

804
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:52,090
the group they've got the would put the
placebo

805
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,809
and the group that got nothing

806
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:56,389
and when you do that

807
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:58,769
they got nothing

808
00:35:58,769 --> 00:35:59,710
here we have

809
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:03,709
for dichotomous endpoints our basic or
not

810
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:06,579
this is something called the relative
risk ratio you'll have to worry about

811
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:07,060
that

812
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,999
but basically

813
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,059
this point means that there is no

814
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:11,290
placebo effect at all

815
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,749
and what you can see is

816
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:13,949
at the values

817
00:36:13,949 --> 00:36:16,490
or nicely normally distributed

818
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,089
around no effect

819
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:24,499
here for continuous endpoints how high
is your blood pressure what it whatever

820
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:26,509
here is

821
00:36:26,509 --> 00:36:31,289
milan no effect and there's a little bit
of a fact but again you get this nice

822
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,179
kind of sort of normal distribution

823
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:34,559
uh... things

824
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,220
hundred fifty-six studies

825
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,340
leading are these guys to conclude

826
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,249
that in fact

827
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:42,160
the placebo effect

828
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,999
that their art

829
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:45,569
anne placebo effect

830
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:49,519
which is rape i'll tell ya about
conclusion that upset the whole bunch of

831
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:54,539
people in the same in the in the domain
on both psychosomatic medicine

832
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:57,179
for which is so increasingly accepted

833
00:36:57,179 --> 00:36:58,529
fly alone

834
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:01,159
barnyard by people

835
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:05,269
medicines just not something we have to
worry about much less actively use

836
00:37:05,269 --> 00:37:06,829
now it turns out

837
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:08,390
that there are all

838
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:12,070
there are some problems with although it
but with this analysis mostly having to

839
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:15,700
do with the kinds of studies that they
had to use they say they had use

840
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,719
anything that

841
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:18,379
had already been generated

842
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:22,949
uh... including all of the trial's that
had a nice sensible placebo condition

843
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,749
that really wasn't

844
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:28,759
audio placebo condition when you do
these kinds of meadow analyses reviews

845
00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:29,829
of literature

846
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:32,139
you're basically stock with what you've
got

847
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:35,209
but there are experimental studies

848
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:38,289
web based studies not necessarily
clinical trials

849
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,720
which clearly show

850
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,189
all of that placebos can have an effect

851
00:37:43,189 --> 00:37:46,769
are not on various kinds of medical
outcomes the place where you see that's

852
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:47,779
a lot

853
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:51,229
all use it and not is in pain

854
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:52,750
here it is a home

855
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,759
really interesting study done by

856
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:57,749
fred evans who was one of my teachers

857
00:37:57,749 --> 00:38:00,229
graduate school

858
00:38:00,229 --> 00:38:02,289
what evidence did was to review

859
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:05,599
of large number of laboratory studies

860
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,340
comparing the effects of

861
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,499
various

862
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:09,049
drugs

863
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:11,049
too

864
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:12,809
ordered to placebo

865
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:16,549
caught in the control of laboratory
paint this is pain

866
00:38:16,549 --> 00:38:20,700
the wrote we have lots of ways of
laboratory to induce pain

867
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,859
below my favorite is cold cold pressor
game where you take somebody's forearm

868
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:28,429
in this ticketed circulating ice water

869
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:32,419
and after about thirty seconds forty
five seconds the pain gets really really

870
00:38:32,419 --> 00:38:34,329
really unbearable

871
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:36,720
home or there's a better job

872
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,269
kind dot disconnect muscle pain report
of blood pressure cough

873
00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:42,829
on the persons alone on the person's arm

874
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:46,619
had to do some work which involved with
exhaust the oxygen

875
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:50,940
and the uh... ultimately the blood down
here new blood can't get down here to

876
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,349
adapt to the forearm

877
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:53,539
and that pain

878
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:57,190
that is the best analog clinical paying
money can buy it

879
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,039
or just feels like somebody's

880
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:01,719
tearing your inside-out it's just
unbelievable

881
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,009
and really good

882
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:04,689
ought to do in the laboratory

883
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:08,339
there are some others that are less
palatable hall one of my ego but my

884
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:11,190
former colleagues was

885
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:17,180
was enamored of electrical stimulation
of truthful

886
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,199
and there are others

887
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,289
all but in any event solved

888
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:23,619
what might happen in these laboratory so
easily find a way to induce pain

889
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:25,930
you give one group

890
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,579
solidly yaar

891
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:32,670
i'm active drug like morphine or door
bonneville max or whatever

892
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,259
another group of placebo in men than for
notre dame control group

893
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:37,800
and what evan stand here

894
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,069
was through all of the plot but he
called placebo efficiency

895
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:45,070
how well all the placebo did

896
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,089
compared to the drug

897
00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:52,209
and what he discovered was a placebo
efficiency is a constant across a wide

898
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:53,410
range of drugs

899
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,319
so that

900
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:59,709
if you think you're getting morphine
placebo as half as effective as morphing

901
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:04,729
if you think you're getting darbone
placebo as half as effective as dharwad

902
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:07,109
if you think you're getting coding

903
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:09,839
placebos happens affective as

904
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,050
if you think you're getting ronald
reagan but it does the lacks any more

905
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,489
so what that is

906
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:14,890
alm

907
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,189
if you think you're getting aspirin

908
00:40:17,189 --> 00:40:19,919
placebos half as effective as asked for

909
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,939
that's a very interesting affect

910
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:25,839
but what's really interesting about it
and looked in the present context is

911
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,409
the placebo effect is modulated by the
persons

912
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:32,270
what date

913
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,249
thank they're getting

914
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:34,780
determines

915
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,539
how effective the placebo width

916
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:41,439
placebo aspirin is not nearly as
effective for pain relief is working

917
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:48,439
but placebo aspirin is happens affected
israel aspirin

918
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:52,019
drop to my knowledge

919
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:54,880
i mean gal boy i see where you're going
with that

920
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,109
yet you consider going to really you're
shooting up now and uh... they're not

921
00:40:58,109 --> 00:40:59,539
shooting up

922
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:00,259
calm

923
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:03,329
allied but they still get half the high
that they would be i think that they did

924
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:04,839
that they did shoot up

925
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:09,509
there are placebo effects in drug
addiction

926
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:12,880
i'm told about this i've got no personal
experience with it

927
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,260
but it's well known

928
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,850
that just a slight of for injection drug
abusers for example just the sight of

929
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,710
the injection drug apparatus

930
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,829
is about to to reduce

931
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:25,579
withdrawal

932
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:27,129
drug created

933
00:41:27,129 --> 00:41:30,680
now when you get a higher not out of
that isn't completely clear

934
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,959
but the fact of the matter is most drug
addicts don't get high anyway

935
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:40,309
appear addicted the whole noble goal
whole process of getting addicted

936
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:43,659
is that you don't get high anymore
you're still trying to stave off

937
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:44,859
withdrawal effects

938
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:47,869
so there are these kinds of placebo
effect

939
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:52,449
there are similar kinds of the simple
fact seemed chemotherapy

940
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:53,230
cancer

941
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,999
treatment this is very well known

942
00:41:54,999 --> 00:42:00,089
that went on a cancer patients come in
to beyond student would be a triple room

943
00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:02,969
and they're just exposed to the
apparatus already start feeling

944
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:04,119
nauseated

945
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:08,729
uh... so that there are headed
chemotherapy for the cancer chemotherapy

946
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:10,759
offered produce nauseous a side effect

947
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:12,839
but this compound be condition

948
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:14,309
harm as well

949
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:15,499
here you've got

950
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:19,569
something like a specific belief about
the drug

951
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:23,749
modulates effect of the placebo and
there i think is really really nice

952
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,790
evidence for a mental state

953
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:31,329
i got to do a couple more things quickly
but picked some questions

954
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:34,510
yeah i would have been cold and that's
the implication right

955
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,270
art youth you've you've you've got to
you've got a pain that you would

956
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:40,109
effectively tree with coding thing i'm
going to give you some more free time

957
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:42,479
all while i'm gonna get working

958
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:45,529
you get a defect that's happened with
his more free which is probably just

959
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:50,309
about what codeine does for you yet you
could do that

960
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:56,989
you could do that part as president
nixon used to say it would be wrong

961
00:42:56,989 --> 00:42:58,889
the reason i would be wrong

962
00:42:58,889 --> 00:43:00,669
is that

963
00:43:00,669 --> 00:43:03,719
uh... under one interpretation medical
ethics

964
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:07,519
positions of us postal lied to their
patients

965
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,819
all and although there is a new
literature

966
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:11,880
although there's a guy had captured

967
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,569
pod at harvard

968
00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:15,440
gould actually has evidence

969
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,309
suggesting that if you say the people

970
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:19,380
this is a placebo

971
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,509
and it'll be good for your irritable
bowel syndrome

972
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:25,619
that actually works

973
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:28,819
okay you tell people it's a placebo

974
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:29,420
palm

975
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,589
that's kind of weird

976
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:33,299
all but what

977
00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:35,210
obama captured dogs actually

978
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:39,150
is he he's a big believer in placebo
effect sat in mind-body healing and

979
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,910
stuff like that he tells people

980
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:45,140
that uh... the before see both furs
mind-body healing stalin

981
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,220
consensus kind of list

982
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,369
special story

983
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:50,050
oh of what will the whole world around
us

984
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:53,039
let's do a little bit more uncle siebel
effects

985
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,839
all vote will forget this

986
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:56,829
all for now

987
00:43:56,829 --> 00:44:00,779
look to the lecture supplements for that
okay because the more work by all by

988
00:44:00,779 --> 00:44:02,189
fred evans

989
00:44:02,189 --> 00:44:04,729
reviewing the effects of placebos and
pain

990
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:07,419
it turns out that palm

991
00:44:07,419 --> 00:44:11,130
placebos are more effective if you've
got severe pain that if you got only

992
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,379
mild pain

993
00:44:13,379 --> 00:44:17,279
awlbayes adults response curve onto what
to placebos

994
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:22,909
so placebos give you more pain relief
and one placebo

995
00:44:22,909 --> 00:44:24,609
there's a time affect curve

996
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:27,529
if you've got a job you've got an active
agent

997
00:44:27,529 --> 00:44:30,519
that's got to have to life was saved
four hours

998
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:32,769
the placebo will also have a half-life

999
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:35,529
of approximately

1000
00:44:35,529 --> 00:44:37,989
their adult dad evans was able to

1001
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:40,039
the document additive effects

1002
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:41,650
also that bob

1003
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,450
drug of there are some people or real
placebo responders their individual

1004
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,849
differences among medical patients

1005
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:51,579
and the effects of algae that drugs are
much bigger in people who are known

1006
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:56,240
to respond unstable which suggested a
placebo effect and the drug effect is

1007
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,069
piled on top of that

1008
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:03,329
there are also problems with patient
beliefs if you tell people they're going

1009
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:07,369
to get a debit might get a placebo
you've got less of a placebo effect

1010
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:13,329
on his uh... the studies that evans had
uh... had reviewed

1011
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:14,729
barbara studies were done

1012
00:45:14,729 --> 00:45:15,810
poem board

1013
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,029
people didn't know they were getting
pussy willows

1014
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:19,730
and their physician practices

1015
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:20,710
it turns out

1016
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,060
that positions

1017
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,139
huang

1018
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:28,559
dot gupta dispense medications very
easily and very frequently

1019
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,789
the tend to get bigger placebo fax then
positions who or much more

1020
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:36,899
wary about to spend dispensing medicines

1021
00:45:36,899 --> 00:45:38,469
more about him

1022
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:44,920
big placebo pills are more effective the
little placebo pills

1023
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,170
colored placebo pills

1024
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,339
far more effective than brightly-colored

1025
00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:49,719
placebo pills

1026
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:53,340
placebo pills the taste bad far more
effective the placebo pills

1027
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,479
that pays good

1028
00:45:55,479 --> 00:46:00,179
placebo delivered intravenously is more
effective than the placebo delivered

1029
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:05,140
intramuscular lee which is more
effective than placebo delivered orally

1030
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:09,539
no to my knowledge there is no study of

1031
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:11,889
rectly delivered

1032
00:46:11,889 --> 00:46:15,169
all but because that's really a burst of
procedure you destruct ought to be

1033
00:46:15,169 --> 00:46:19,890
dynamite placebos

1034
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,150
and dog

1035
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,290
expensive placebos

1036
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,430
far more effective

1037
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:26,239
then chief placebos

1038
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:29,009
heroes work all from all

1039
00:46:29,009 --> 00:46:31,649
almost a program for promoting a product

1040
00:46:31,649 --> 00:46:34,609
behavior like a economic flatbed m_i_t_

1041
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:39,329
all this is all things people effect on
pain induced by electrical shock

1042
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:43,839
on the study was done under the guidance
of a of a new drug trial

1043
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:46,039
and in some subjects were told

1044
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:50,099
they were getting called they're getting
video regular

1045
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,309
operates drug

1046
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:54,340
and others were told that they were
gettin cheap

1047
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,509
generic

1048
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:57,390
and you've got

1049
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:59,529
more all data stable allsec

1050
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:02,659
when subjects thought they were getting
the more expensive

1051
00:47:02,659 --> 00:47:05,639
solved other proprietary uh... agent

1052
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:06,460
so again

1053
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,089
there are a bunch of these kinds of a
fax

1054
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:13,839
what's interesting about these placebo
effect is that day there well documented

1055
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,650
they have a note rieben control attached
to them

1056
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,970
and they show barry clearly

1057
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:24,479
that it's the person's believe that is
producing the affect

1058
00:47:24,479 --> 00:47:28,400
is the belief subs mental state it's
what you think you're getting

1059
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,430
is going to are perfect

1060
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,589
all of the deal

1061
00:47:32,589 --> 00:47:35,429
niigata skip over a couple things here

1062
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:38,809
comb i'll skip over this

1063
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:43,049
here's all the beltway dot very
interesting a recent renders work by

1064
00:47:43,049 --> 00:47:46,829
altman benedetti in this group of the
grip of italian positions

1065
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:47,900
gould compared

1066
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,359
what they call open versus hidden
treatment

1067
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,330
what they do in these experiments

1068
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,950
is a bit surreal clinic patients who
were getting enough

1069
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:56,819
fective treatment

1070
00:47:56,819 --> 00:48:00,779
for all of the poor for or what one
illness or another

1071
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:05,169
one verbal patience is pulled out of
getting the treatment

1072
00:48:05,169 --> 00:48:06,489
other group of patients

1073
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:09,119
gets the same treatment but are not

1074
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,039
told they're getting it

1075
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:13,859
open person couldn't read

1076
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:16,820
here all we have all of this is all

1077
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,529
effective died as a paramedic

1078
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:22,679
for postoperative inviting infer trickle
patients

1079
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:24,519
all of the open treatment

1080
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:29,640
how is it not reason green and it turns
out

1081
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,079
when you interrupt to treatment

1082
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:36,619
and you but you don't tell people
directors just obey doesn't have dripped

1083
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:38,749
that's going into

1084
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,509
if you would drop the treatment but you
don't kill the patient you're

1085
00:48:41,509 --> 00:48:42,749
interrupting the treatment

1086
00:48:42,749 --> 00:48:44,070
or they still get

1087
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:48,420
reduction of anxiety if u_n_ tour up the
delivery of value as a pen and you tell

1088
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,799
the patient that you're stopping

1089
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:52,760
but the others have delivery withdrawn

1090
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,089
when you get an increase

1091
00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:55,630
and anxiety

1092
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:58,970
here's another one this is all morphine
from post-operative pain

1093
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,459
in surgical or other treatments

1094
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:05,750
on again your interrupting the morphine
you're not delivering it and you wonder

1095
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,680
if you tell people

1096
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,089
experience more pain then if u on if you
don't kill people

1097
00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:16,599
and here's another one from benedetti
all of this is all response only in

1098
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:19,089
parkinson's patients

1099
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,459
to the delivery oval

1100
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,759
of small electrical order current

1101
00:49:23,759 --> 00:49:25,099
to the home

1102
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:27,099
to the paulus

1103
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:30,289
and what you can see here is that this
is

1104
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:32,069
movement velocity

1105
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:39,069
what how much of a tremor you're getting

1106
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,809
if you'd not telling the police
parkinson's patients are being

1107
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:43,779
stimulated

1108
00:49:43,779 --> 00:49:46,339
and if you don't tell them you stopped

1109
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:50,569
continue to get some traveling so here
again what you what we're seeing or the

1110
00:49:50,569 --> 00:49:53,329
effects of the patients police

1111
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:55,809
about his or her

1112
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:56,609
all effecting

1113
00:49:56,609 --> 00:50:00,989
the patients aren't part of the clinical
condition

1114
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:02,319
so what we got here

1115
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,209
are a whole bunch of psychosomatic
affects

1116
00:50:05,209 --> 00:50:06,350
where stress

1117
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,949
has an effect on disease

1118
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:10,250
suggestion and belief

1119
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,190
has an effect on disease and its
treatment

1120
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,009
patients expectations

1121
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:17,089
about what's going to happen to them

1122
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:18,089
all affect

1123
00:50:18,089 --> 00:50:21,560
all the better affect the reactions of
their bodies to various kinds of

1124
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,089
treatments

1125
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:25,009
the whole thing suggests

1126
00:50:25,009 --> 00:50:29,139
words and beliefs and expectations of
other kinds of mental state

1127
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:30,390
can in fact have

1128
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:32,249
of facts on disease

1129
00:50:32,249 --> 00:50:34,829
and arms industry

1130
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:36,150
that's just a rough torque

1131
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:39,539
i'll be psychosomatic effect

1132
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:42,239
palm evidence that suggests that

1133
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,649
mental status

1134
00:50:43,649 --> 00:50:45,979
an expectation

1135
00:50:45,979 --> 00:50:48,169
barnali prophecies

1136
00:50:48,169 --> 00:50:52,909
