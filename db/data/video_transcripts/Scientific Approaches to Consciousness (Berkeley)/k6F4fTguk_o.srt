1
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:08,699
okay let's pick up where we left off
last time

2
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:11,269
just to review from

3
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:14,349
last

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,880
from last lecture

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,869
general anesthesia looks like a loss of
consciousness and it is a loss of

6
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:23,799
consciousness

7
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:27,279
adequately anaesthetized patients is not
aware of what's going on with the

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,099
surgery or anyplace else

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,630
on not aware of this home

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,650
forty five

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,510
operating team is saying or any of that

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,780
nevertheless it turns out that at least
under some circumstances adequately

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,610
anaesthetized patients can display
implicit memory forum vents that

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,780
occurred during the

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,160
during the surgery

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,700
and we know that for experiments in
which

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,139
also addicts are played things like
words or music or whatever

18
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:58,579
and then they're given the implicit
memory tests mitterrand

19
00:00:58,579 --> 00:00:59,750
and all

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,520
more often than you'd expect

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,180
all they do show home

22
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,920
they do show to show some spirit priming

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,900
despite the fact that body definition

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,640
adequately anaesthetized patients

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,709
explosive memory

26
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:15,040
for all further medical procedures

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,010
and this is now been confirmed on board
and a bunch of different ways i don't

28
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,860
want to go back to that home today

29
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,920
except to say that

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,240
from my point of view

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,060
what we've seen our tests of implicit
memory for surgical of ends

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,760
but seems to me that what we're really
seeing here is implicit memory as

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,640
evidence for implicit perception

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,880
remember hide distinguish between
implicit memory where the person has

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,220
conscious awareness of the event that
that at the time it occurred

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,060
but memory for that event has been lost
the conscious recollection

37
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,530
so priming affects custard evidence for
implicit memory

38
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,749
but in this case

39
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:54,790
you've got

40
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,900
ald no conscious perception of the
events at the time that they occurred at

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:04,080
least as far as we can tell but you've
still got psalm are spared priming and

42
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,890
so what we're really looking at here

43
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,050
is evidence of implicit

44
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,299
perception

45
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:14,389
now why wont to shift now to arm

46
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:17,409
went to work on the bone problems of
karma

47
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:21,620
physicians often refer to general
anesthesia as a controlled coma

48
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,790
put the patient into a coma you do the
procedure you bring the patient out of

49
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,170
on

50
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,190
all of the coma and that's not a bad
analogy

51
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,800
what would really like to do though

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,799
is to see

53
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:34,900
what kind of all the more what happens
to consciousness

54
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,520
in cases of

55
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,890
uncontrolled coma that is the medical
syndrome where by virtue of some sort of

56
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,720
brain damage

57
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,629
the person loses

58
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,490
palm of them loses consciousness

59
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,289
either for an extended period of time

60
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:49,490
days weeks

61
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,879
ones years hall or

62
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,339
for that matter on the permanently

63
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:58,809
let's first a little medical terminology
to distinguish between all three quite

64
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:01,459
different to poland and urological
syndromes

65
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:02,819
first concussion

66
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,219
all which solid

67
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,129
refers in the medical terminology simply
to a temporary disturbance of

68
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:09,989
consciousness

69
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,559
it's the kind of thing the results
typically from what's known as a closed

70
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,799
head injury

71
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,459
if u samak your called near

72
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,809
your head on the out of the wind chill
of your car during automobile accident

73
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:25,859
or you get that long to get from
clustering football or soccer practice

74
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:26,870
or whatever

75
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,880
that's what happens

76
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,629
there's a temporary disturbance of
consciousness

77
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:33,839
not necessarily a loss of consciousness

78
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,459
fall but though the condoms sentencing
law

79
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,239
into a young

80
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,369
we're in st

81
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:44,759
in carmel you have a chronic loss of
consciousness that is that's what's it

82
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,849
say they are

83
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,439
wass of consciousness from which the
person does not read carver

84
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,579
all in a over relatively quick period of
time

85
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:56,479
you know if you can lose consciousness
completely if you sustain

86
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,360
uh... serious enough welcome closed head
injury

87
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,189
but you will spontaneously come out of
it

88
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:05,049
called after a relatively brief period
of time

89
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:07,860
but in carmel abut which a lot more to
say in a minute

90
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,130
we've got a loss of consciousness

91
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,079
that extends for a long period of time

92
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,950
and the person can't be all rollins
doesn't respond at all

93
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,430
even ald when subjected to vigorous so
we're all very painful

94
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,430
on the stimuli

95
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,840
and all color is

96
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,920
then distinguished from afar third
category of neurological all the best

97
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,299
known as stupor

98
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:33,479
where again you've got a chronic loss of
consciousness

99
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,080
but despite this quantic loss of
consciousness

100
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,939
the person will respond

101
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:42,560
to are vigorous or in pencil holder
regan painful stimuli

102
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,930
you can squeeze your arms squeezed her
hand this over that very very very hard

103
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,509
and they'll come out of a little bit as
soon as you let go they go back in

104
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,620
that would be that would be stupor

105
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,870
in coma you don't see anything like that

106
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:01,870
all at all

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,029
no it's not

108
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:09,080
it has some id has sold more all of the
similarities to but

109
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,539
christopher we're talking about
something that's very

110
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,220
transitory okay

111
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,089
will go on for minutes or maybe hours

112
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:19,729
but the vegetative status on that goes
on for days weeks months

113
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,650
years amid talk about that for a lot

114
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,330
in this lecture

115
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,830
just stood to let you know it's actually
possible to do experiments on these

116
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,510
things one of my favorite experiments
call in the uh...

117
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,960
neuropsychological literature

118
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,550
i'll buy yarnell and when she long time
ago

119
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,680
on the daily that expected that was
experienced by college football players

120
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,270
they manage to

121
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,489
get themselves seated on the bench

122
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:45,960
or with old

123
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,330
with various college football teams

124
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,560
and whenever one of the album

125
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,429
players would get gained on the field
that is

126
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:59,010
get rid of the head and scroll out lose
consciousness their ran out there

127
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,370
and as soon as the medical team had
taken a look at the uh... but that the

128
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,120
person

129
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,139
bait and the person to be going to arm
won't come out of oil

130
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,050
commodity xo home concussion

131
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,119
they did minister

132
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,769
little memory tests they'd save what was
the number of the guy who hit you

133
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:16,939
on what was a number of the play you
were running the power and and and all

134
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,619
of that the kind of track

135
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:23,149
all peoples long wallis and recovery
global of of memory

136
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,180
and in this case

137
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,680
uh... in uh... in in this particular
study there was really no loss of

138
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,019
consciousness of all

139
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:32,950
there was that some kind of a media
disorientation of something closer to

140
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:38,500
to stupor but what they did discover was
that within minutes on the concussion

141
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,500
all within minutes and kind of walking
off the field have been carried off the

142
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,400
field

143
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,270
these old these players tended to lose
memory

144
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,050
so the effects of a concussion are not
necessarilly

145
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,210
belong

146
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,180
visible home all of the immediately so
when your head on the head

147
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,759
okay

148
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,620
get up and start trying to think that
there's something right

149
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,500
are you really believe the they get
somebody to take a look at you

150
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,229
on many of your recovery of the famous
case of the tasha richardson

151
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,139
the uh... that the actress who was could
cost today

152
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,529
i skiing accident hit a tree or
something like remember exactly what it

153
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:16,499
was

154
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:19,859
and she was fine she walked away that
ought to provide thought she was fine

155
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:21,899
and the next day she was dead

156
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:26,979
pollen because structure had closed head
injury and all of the blood had built up

157
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,589
all got phone calls and pressure on the
brain

158
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:33,709
so whenever there is any kind of head
injury even if it's a closed head injury

159
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:34,699
know what

160
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,310
or no bleeding or whatever

161
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,520
you're really need to see somebody

162
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:45,520
along and get them get a value-added yet

163
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,259
well be entered for one thing

164
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:52,770
sometimes people don't even ask

165
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,669
and she wasn't disoriented what happened
when the tasha richardson case was that

166
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:01,599
there was there was a came a drama club
called of audio completing all inside

167
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,210
the door of of the brain

168
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,009
and that just kinda build the build-up
and created pressure on the brain from

169
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:07,889
the blood

170
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,720
if they had climate

171
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,569
they couldn't believe that and she'd be
alive today

172
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,220
all but uh... it just built up

173
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,249
too long too much

174
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:17,979
olwen and uh... uh...

175
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:24,979
the that the extra pressure on the brain
killed all the brain tissue and

176
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:27,249
it's it's serious business

177
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:30,650
okay let's look at look at called light
itself now

178
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,159
alm

179
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:34,719
here's the medical definition all the
medical diagnosis of caramel

180
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,480
loss of consciousness

181
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,570
indicated by you

182
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,650
failure of the patient to communicate

183
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,610
the lack of patient response to
stimulation

184
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,379
these are ordered to review say
something visual job shoulder something

185
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:47,009
or

186
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:51,089
on you make bob prick their skin with a
uh... for the pad or something but with

187
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:52,250
the pin

188
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,630
on no signs of a motion in common
vegetative functions are ok the patient

189
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,800
is breathing on his own

190
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,020
small and although the heart rate does
they did is doing what it's supposed to

191
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,640
be doing

192
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,000
you know i start closed permanently
closed

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,600
or and there is no evidence of the
patients can't do anything like

194
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,350
on normal sleep cycles

195
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,660
on that the way you know

196
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,929
the way we would that's a contrast with
the vegetative state which i'm going to

197
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:20,150
talk about on you know in a second

198
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,360
so that's what goes on in coma

199
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,190
clinically we evaluate all of the coal
according to our yard that the test

200
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,110
known as the glass gold colour scale

201
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,560
all which on who you evaluate the
person's best response to a command to

202
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,310
open your eyes

203
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,460
they open arise spontaneously that's
really good thing if they don't open

204
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,430
arise at all that's a bad thing

205
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,050
best verbal response u_s_ from a
question

206
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,740
if they can't answer that's a bad thing

207
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,459
all

208
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:51,169
if they can you estimate who they are
where they think they are what day it is

209
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,830
a thorough re-entered the time place in
person

210
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,280
that's a very good thing

211
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,160
and then there's the best motor response
not at all

212
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,900
which is classic case in coma

213
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:07,370
or that able to obey commands so they
won't burn valuation of person state of

214
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,950
consciousness clinically all of the goes
by this glasgow coma scale which is used

215
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,540
pretty much universally on now

216
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,170
and if you score alone

217
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,549
if you score all the less than eight on
the salt that on the scale

218
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:23,230
that's considered to be a severe

219
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,100
uh... severe komal

220
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,839
if you score higher

221
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,199
automat that's all that's relatively

222
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:31,750
bulge of the good thing

223
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,430
okay now we get to your vegetative state
all which is something that

224
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,419
when it happens typically follows the
cold war

225
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:40,390
person goes into a coma first

226
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,660
then begins to recover from the cold war
palm

227
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,900
usually within about a month or so

228
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,090
and what distinguishes though though
vegetative state from although from a

229
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:50,680
color

230
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,300
is that

231
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,449
the person appears to be awake

232
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:56,350
but still doesn't appear to have
consciousness

233
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,029
so what we mean is that

234
00:10:58,029 --> 00:10:59,350
the persons are used

235
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,750
are open

236
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,160
palm and they open and close

237
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,460
o'connor diary all go according to
something that looks like the normal

238
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,010
sleep cycle

239
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:12,260
nevertheless despite the fact that the
patient's eyes are open

240
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,910
all

241
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,379
there's no communication

242
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:17,930
there may be some response to conclude
that the stimulation

243
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,720
if there's a very loud

244
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,650
very loud noise in the room the person
my shop startle reflex

245
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,770
or if it's a very very noxious cost plus
another sensory stimulus the person my

246
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:35,770
show a response to that but not very
much dot

247
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,930
you know that there hasn't been that
much work on the exactly what the sleep

248
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,570
cycles or like in you know

249
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,400
you know

250
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,480
vegetative state and i don't know why
that is 'cause that's an ideas thing to

251
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,600
do

252
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,990
all but the behaviorally what happens is
the person's eyes will be open for a

253
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,410
long time and then they'll

254
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,170
close

255
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,530
and then they'll open again for a long
time and then they'll close just kind of

256
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,310
like you would not eat or in class or
something like that just

257
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,570
on the bore the person seems to be going

258
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,729
all through some kind of regular
rhythmic

259
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:08,710
uh... cycle

260
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,230
all i'm sure there is such a study out
there cuz i can't imagine somebody

261
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,180
hasn't done it

262
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,720
but i'm not aware of it so i'm not going
to look that up

263
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,740
okay that's that that's a very very good
very very good question

264
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,239
alm

265
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,620
here is just a little grass

266
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,810
from uh... epidemiological study dawn
auto them some time ago that's

267
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,680
purvi represented what what what goes on
now

268
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,060
what we've got here it is on two-time
since

269
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,040
a severe head injury

270
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,980
and the percentage of patients who are
in the uh... uh...

271
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,190
uh... perks persistent vegetative state

272
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,610
all the if it's one month

273
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,880
ten percent

274
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,770
then there is some recovery

275
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,160
so that

276
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,199
for year after the head injury

277
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:55,299
all fewer than two percent all doll
headed your patients or renault more

278
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,840
persistent vegetative state

279
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,130
but if you think about how many such
people there are actually quite a bit

280
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,860
there

281
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,920
and fifteen twenty thousand

282
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:09,100
cause of such patients all around in a
medium in any given year

283
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,170
what goes on in the brain in colour and
persistent vegetative state

284
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,860
i think the best way to think about the
persistent vegetative state

285
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,759
is that it's

286
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,880
a less severe komal

287
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,780
the damage the brain damage seized seems
to be pretty much the same

288
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,049
in phnom while

289
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:28,400
you know to be either case

290
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,600
well primary damages in the reticular
formation the sort of part of the brain

291
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,710
stem

292
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,870
projecting up into walk into the palace

293
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,380
on especially implicating these two

294
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,690
alba regions of the uh... within the
reticular formation

295
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,570
the curry ecuador pple gray right about
there

296
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,080
and the para break you'll

297
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,990
nucleus right about there

298
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:53,059
it's also possible to get called off
from diane c palak damage

299
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:55,710
damage to the fallacy for example

300
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,610
all but

301
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,000
one way or the other

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,400
on what's happening is

303
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,750
communication with the cerebral cortex

304
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,480
is basically on disrupted cause all such
communication

305
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,600
runs through the reticular formation

306
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,269
on and uh... and the foul so that's
basically what happens

307
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,960
bear

308
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,610
alm

309
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:20,040
and it's this kind of evidence that gave
rise to of the the idea of a reticular

310
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,550
activating system

311
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,900
that is with that one of the functions
of the reticular formation is to send a

312
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:31,190
message is off into the cortex that
keeps the cortex all white and alert

313
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,370
and sleep cycles

314
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,290
well-regulated

315
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,120
palm out here

316
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,050
all of the that this was first
discovered by a are two italian

317
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,940
investigators neurophysiology groups in
the group

318
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,059
on you know in nineteen forty nine

319
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:48,590
they dropped microelectrode stone into
the particular formation of caps

320
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,120
and what they discovered

321
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,160
all was that if u barbecue lesion the
reticular formation

322
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,350
you've got to palm belgium the cat space
we went to sleep

323
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,550
they've off the lobster into a comatose
state

324
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,350
home

325
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,750
and if you still a good

326
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,970
that same region

327
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,089
told barbour cats would stay awake
permanently that as soon as it turned

328
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:08,399
off the stimulation

329
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,570
the cats would go back to their normal
all sleep cycle

330
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,720
we now know again for work by a group c
in the boom

331
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,399
that all if you region

332
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,280
this area of the particular formation
so-called rostral area towards the front

333
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,540
towards the peace

334
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,980
on you guessed dog the animal falls
asleep

335
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,920
briefly lapses into a coma

336
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,030
if u lesion

337
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,660
rear area of the coral

338
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,430
haldol

339
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,380
ordered area towards betrayal

340
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,640
all what what you get is insomnia
instead

341
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,600
can dalton

342
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,520
it's this

343
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,950
there's a particular pattern in the g
that will talk about a little bit next

344
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,410
week

345
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,069
uh... that's a good sign of cortical
activation

346
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:51,660
but it all seems to come from here so if
you damage the reticular formation

347
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,320
what's going to happen is

348
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,860
that the cortex

349
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,059
fog doll that becomes inactive and
that's

350
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:59,220
essentially what you get

351
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,019
birthday ya

352
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:01,580
with a coma

353
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,450
i'm going to skip to main zero

354
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,890
all of members of a syndrome but we want
to talk about here a little bit going to

355
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,890
be relevant on later on

356
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,890
is a syndrome made famous by oliver
sacks in the movie or wake innings

357
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,519
wall and also by of them dot by some
other hong films and uh...

358
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,290
and books known as the locked in
syndrome

359
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,569
in cold blood and the persistent
vegetative state

360
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:29,040
it looks like the patient is unconscious

361
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,989
but in the lockton syndrome it's quite
clear

362
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:34,579
that the person is conscious

363
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:37,819
it's just that the person has lost the
ability to

364
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:38,899
all communicate

365
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,369
either vocally

366
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:42,900
or or through our motion

367
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,560
also there's quadriplegic problem

368
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,070
parapro what's this all before all of
the four limbs

369
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:53,380
orders walsons speech global more so
than the ability to filled vocalize of

370
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,200
all

371
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,870
but it's pretty clear

372
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,150
that these patients

373
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:03,180
compulsive into thin contrast to the
patient's uncoma and be vegetative state

374
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,069
all i have preserved oratorio plugs for
example the preserved auditory and

375
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,290
visual flight

376
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,819
you can play employees of the rule no
show a startle reflex

377
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,089
all you can

378
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,370
moved an object

379
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,900
in front of their eyes and and and and
they'll follow it

380
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,610
and they can communicate

381
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,300
or not vocally

382
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,449
all but they can communicate through i'd
movements you can say blink once for yes

383
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:28,390
and linked waits for no

384
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,010
and all that you do actually get them to
without answered questions

385
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,860
and there's also evidence for preserved
emotion

386
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,309
in these are these patients multiple on
the you know

387
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,470
on the face

388
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,200
something that you also don't see

389
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,830
in comatose patients

390
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,480
or in the persistent vegetative state

391
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,960
the damage and a locked in syndrome is
in a quite different area

392
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,180
on here

393
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,140
palm it so that they screen in the uk
anterior

394
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,130
on the portion of the of the brain stem
the ponds and so on

395
00:17:59,130 --> 00:17:59,649
excluding

396
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:02,070
the reticular formation

397
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,730
the reticular formation is doing its job
to keep the cortex alert

398
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,040
there is damage audited elsewhere in the
alone

399
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,070
in the brain stem

400
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,909
the prevents the person from movie nor
communicating or anything cardinals like

401
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:17,730
that

402
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,570
except

403
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,800
by movements

404
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,880
now how does that work

405
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,520
here are the barometer twelve cranial
nerves almost all of the most and coming

406
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,440
out called beyond of of the brain stem

407
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,990
and what happens is you're getting

408
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,640
damage

409
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,870
here in the all the movies and stuff
along or the violent stuff along

410
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,330
events bearing

411
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,840
on the diane cephlon or the or or or the
cerebral cortex itself

412
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,980
and notice

413
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,159
that palm

414
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,640
if you didn't murder getting all the

415
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,470
soda damage right there

416
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,570
on that basically spares

417
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,020
rb ocular motor nerve so the person
couldn't move reserve arise

418
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,250
and also the truck clear

419
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,179
uh... nerve

420
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,090
on so

421
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,050
there's the damage right there

422
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:02,840
palm and

423
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,330
all of that damage

424
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,500
basically prevents or the person from

425
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,870
are moving or viewable world or
communicating

426
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,170
in the usual way

427
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,650
alm

428
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,270
there are some other terms about the
vegetative state that uh... that uh...

429
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,650
that go wonders why the debate about
this right now

430
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,480
palm about whether we should talk about
uh... persistent vegetative states of

431
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,490
all or just talk about vegetative states
because you

432
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,860
if you call something a persistent
vegetative state and people might not

433
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,020
try hard for

434
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,809
all three of the with haitian

435
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:40,440
but there is now quite a bit of interest
in the home not trying to

436
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,760
on set the stage for people to actually
be calmer instead of

437
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,080
vegetative out

438
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,919
on a uh...

439
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,010
on a hospital bed someplace

440
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,809
log home impatience with a vegetative
state get

441
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:56,080
acts of actual physical therapy to try
to

442
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,630
maintain some muscle tone

443
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,160
or there might be electrical stimulation
of the brain stem to see if you can get

444
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,120
them alert all sorts of things like that

445
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,100
on you can actually paid people to read
the newspaper

446
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,990
part the people in a vegetative state
just a kind of maintained uh... maintain

447
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,770
some kind of

448
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,630
some kind of

449
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,010
and it does happen from time to time
that there are that there is recovering

450
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,160
all from oil from this condition here's
a famous case

451
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,940
on hearing on northern california

452
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,220
couple of years ago

453
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,340
where a woman had lapsed into a coma
appalled by what what one day of that

454
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,980
you gave birth she had a brain tumor she
gave birth

455
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,770
that you have brain tumor surgery lapsed
lot left into a coma

456
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,929
are in stating that cooperating here

457
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:43,370
all and then all of the basically agreed
on a year or so later

458
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,550
or began to show signs of of of recovery

459
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,530
on she ought could in iraq for their
child she could communicate by rolling

460
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,690
their eyes and so on

461
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,820
i don't know what happened to hurt there
hasn't been anything more in the news

462
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,820
uh... about over lately but you do see
these cases once in awhile

463
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,770
and all

464
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,250
there are limits

465
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,360
if the person has been in the persistent
vegetative state

466
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,130
the prospects for recovery or roughly
fifty fifty

467
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,660
uh... fifty fifty

468
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,530
but the longer the vegetative state is
gone on

469
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,100
six months to a year

470
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,610
one to three years

471
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,120
on the less likely any kind of recovery
is going to occur

472
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,260
snot zero

473
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,160
still about five percent

474
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,390
depending on what you mean by recovery
but at least they don't meet clinical

475
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,650
criteria

476
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,489
for the uh...

477
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:34,250
for the vegetative state

478
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,679
but again onto if you're in a coma
tonight's to refute nice of you come out

479
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:39,710
of it

480
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,630
fault of

481
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,590
within a month

482
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,420
otherwise you're very likely the lapse
into into the vegetative state

483
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,140
if you're in the vegetative state

484
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,830
it's really nice to get out of it

485
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,020
within about six months otherwise

486
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,690
the prospects for recovery are
relatively

487
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,830
relatively slim

488
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,440
famous case from a couple years ago most
of your probably remember this sub terri

489
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,670
shaw evolve all who in nineteen ninety

490
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:08,410
on had dot gov they've experienced
cardiac arrest when into a you know

491
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,480
went into a uh...

492
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,690
uh... komal and then into a vegetative
state

493
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:18,280
on eight years later her husband tried
to that ask the court to allow

494
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,420
url

495
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,130
like supports

496
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,750
uh... to be removed

497
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,030
or her parents said no no all that

498
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,250
lab that that would be albright

499
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,130
they thought that

500
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,200
behavior like this suggested that you
might be conscious she was in a

501
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,260
vegetative state

502
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:38,560
for eyes would open or once a while she
blog appeared to do something like smile

503
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,360
all four or or get a little bit weepy

504
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,540
alm there was out of the c_t_ scan or
performed in two thousand two that

505
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,480
suggests that there was really no
cortical tissue there at all that have

506
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,049
all atrophy

507
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:53,730
on

508
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,410
all fucked up all

509
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:59,900
all benchley although the husband
prevailed and although the wildlife

510
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,170
supports removed shy bulldog

511
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,620
and when the home and when she was
autopsied in two thousand five there was

512
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,800
a sensual you know on phone

513
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,350
no uh... them cortical tissue

514
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,240
there

515
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,610
miracle

516
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,400
this is a serious serious

517
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,330
problem for health policy

518
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,670
on what to do with these people how to
manage them how long to continue life

519
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,830
supports and all that there are no weezy
answers at all

520
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,269
all but called

521
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:29,789
as unpalatable trying to show your by
the end of the songs of them were by the

522
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:30,940
end of this lecture

523
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,570
new technologies suggests that

524
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,720
volvo fault

525
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,970
there's new technology the mike that i
should be helpful in resolving these

526
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,400
kinds of cases

527
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,420
or they might make

528
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,270
so uncertain

529
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,250
questions easier to have to answer

530
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,010
but they also might make certain
questions

531
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:53,130
to answer

532
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,630
people in comox and in the vegetarian
state appear to be on conscious whether

533
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:00,960
they're going through the normal
sleep-wake cycle is one thing

534
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,980
but they just don't seem to be
responsive to their own

535
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,880
to their environment at all

536
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,129
the question that that their rights as
naturally as

537
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:12,559
maybe there are some kind of unconscious
processing maybe there's something going

538
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,550
on there

539
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:18,050
but we've got the audits that that's
simply not too old not manifest in terms

540
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,780
of uh... in terms of conscious
processing

541
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,680
and over the last several years people
have tried various techniques to try to

542
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,220
figure out whether that's the case or
not

543
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,870
here's a pioneering study by a winter
extra who was that a graduate student of

544
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,190
the speech and hearing

545
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,799
all program i had a bunch of patients
who were in either an acute vegetative

546
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,480
state that is a bit of a vegetative
state for less than three months

547
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,310
or a persistent vegetative state have
been in it for more than a year

548
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:48,070
and some patients would actually been in
a vegetative state and recovered

549
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,870
and she did something very sad that very
simple really

550
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,730
which was to put them up to a little
psychophysiology kal monitoring device

551
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,980
monitoring what's known as the galvanic
skin potential

552
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,700
changes in the electrical properties of
the skin

553
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,650
and then present them with all

554
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,049
sound

555
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:06,679
to try to induce startle response

556
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,330
continue presenting that sounds to see a
phone there be an oriented responsible

557
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,160
bitch away shin

558
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,029
or she would when the patient eyes were
open she'd or hold up on pictures on

559
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:19,780
familiar and unfamiliar faces

560
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,200
to see if there be a differential
response onto those

561
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,760
and she'd also lol holed up on messages
are worth the risk has written command

562
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,240
finkel sad thought were thinkin angry
thought or whatever

563
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,429
i want to see hall what would uh...

564
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:36,210
what would happen

565
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,910
although this was a pioneering study she
really didn't get that much

566
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,440
palm

567
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,290
uh... here you've got of of the good
probably the simplest test of

568
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:44,840
consciousness

569
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,470
all of the magical

570
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:51,040
of on startle response these are control
patients who are not

571
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,310
argument and a vegetative state courts
they all gave the the startle response

572
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,110
our patients who were recovered

573
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,890
did give a startle response that's
almost definitional

574
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,049
budget all about sixty percent of the
patients in the acute

575
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:07,400
fall below that phase of the pledge it
it is they didn't give

576
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,520
or an acoustic startle response

577
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,260
will be about forty percent of the
chronicle phase so there was some kind

578
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,590
of

579
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,940
prob processing there

580
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,850
but remember that the acoustic startle
response is a reflex

581
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,110
okay and i don't have to have a lot of
consciousness

582
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,280
in order to argument in order to give
that is kind of the bare minimum

583
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,620
for diagnosis of any kind of information
processing

584
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,559
here is also what rick your test

585
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,020
our response to famous faces

586
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,840
control subjects

587
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,860
all the hard though the tend to give a
differential response to famous faces

588
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,720
picture world reagan or or or or
whatever

589
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,300
the acute and the chronic

590
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,990
uh... patience not too much

591
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,310
nor for that matter did the recovered

592
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,230
p_b_s_ stations

593
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,120
which suggests something about the
nature of this recovery

594
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,600
it's possible to come out of the

595
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,730
persistent vegetative state to be able
to interact with your world

596
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,770
it's not that does not mean that you've
returned to full function

597
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,100
these are patients who did not recognize
the picture of the president or pictures

598
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:15,220
of uh... of family members or or
whatever sold they worked

599
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,720
conscious

600
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,600
but they were by no means song

601
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,660
no means fully functioning

602
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,340
all what doctor extra did find however

603
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,579
was that

604
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:28,369
response to her test during the
persistent vegetative state didn't

605
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:29,750
predict

606
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,440
recovery

607
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,649
from the persistent vegetated state that
is

608
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:36,020
dot blot you go to the patient did show
the store response

609
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,230
they were much more likely to come
through to recover that if they didn't

610
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,980
if they didn't show

611
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,849
differential response to famous faces

612
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:46,970
they were much more likely to recover
than they did

613
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,850
so there are some implications here for
rehabilitation

614
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:54,500
you might think about doing some testing
like this with the patient

615
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,410
vegetative state

616
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,419
to try to are the figure out what kind
of off

617
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:01,179
what kind of treatment they should do
all of them that they should get

618
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,009
wilder in

619
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:04,530
that state

620
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,619
okay now just a complicate things
further

621
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,379
are just so you know what his car that
their colleagues all at in the uh...

622
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:13,680
the vivid in two thousand two

623
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,429
argued that

624
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:18,039
for some patients in the persistent
vegetative state

625
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:22,590
there is another evidence of conscious
mental activity

626
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,450
that we'd need a new label

627
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,090
for these patients we shouldn't call
them vegetative state patients

628
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,399
all instead

629
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:30,609
although they proposed

630
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:32,880
a new category

631
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,250
minimally conscious patience patience in
the minimally conscious state

632
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,119
where the patient's ought to be you get
this label

633
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,039
if you had

634
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,729
some partial response

635
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:45,070
or even inconsistent response

636
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,380
to the kinds of tests that i talked
about ulm before

637
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,170
all

638
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,080
all but

639
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,310
consistent and not a full response
necessarily custom you fully responded

640
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,050
consistently on these tests

641
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,320
there be no question about whether you
have a vegetative state are not newbies

642
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,740
are going to be classified as as
conscious

643
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,230
but these will attest that jesse no ald
all

644
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,150
law and the federal proposed

645
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,210
all for diagnosing this off

646
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:17,410
the state leading to real debate in the
medical literature

647
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,289
weather

648
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,750
patients who meet the criterion for the
minimally conscious state

649
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,250
should be

650
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,700
treated differently

651
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:29,630
in rehabilitation then patients volume
media in the dedicated state this is a

652
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,390
question basically a medical ethics and
social question of

653
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,570
all of of of how much money

654
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,510
but at least

655
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,739
onto c l_ began to all

656
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:42,029
began to argue

657
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:43,380
all that

658
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,160
by virtual gifts just kind of standard
clinical criteria we ought to be able to

659
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,960
distinguish

660
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,870
between patients who are clearly not
conscious of all like ever

661
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:57,589
even though they seem to be going to the
sleep-wake cycle and their vegetative

662
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:58,710
since we're okay

663
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,110
and patients who do seem to have a psalm

664
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,169
degree of consciousness

665
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:05,880
sometimes

666
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,809
the obvious thing to do

667
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:10,159
in these guarded in these cases

668
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:10,910
used to

669
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,370
look at brain

670
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,089
function

671
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:15,390
home more on more or less directly

672
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,640
church to remember looked at order nomic
nervous system activity

673
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,980
the a galvanic skin potential or
galvanic skin response as well

674
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,300
peripheral measure

675
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,790
palm of blood called

676
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,660
we now have the ability

677
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,070
on using things like

678
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,740
cat scans and all that related
potentials and even off

679
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,240
on m_r_i_ scans

680
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:42,240
to be able to look at the brain function
in these patients

681
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,410
pioneering study by ship of his
colleagues to patients

682
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,629
diagnosed with all of the the minimally
conscious state

683
00:30:49,629 --> 00:30:50,580
okay

684
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,980
although and what they did was to

685
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:59,759
although called record the subjects of
brain responses various kinds of

686
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,820
the various kinds of stimuli

687
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,870
touching the hands

688
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,740
although telling them stories about
family all of the family events

689
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,880
all worried even laudatory or the
passages

690
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,420
and in one of these conditions have read
your gpa repetitive straight

691
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,409
and the other condition read 'em

692
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:17,300
backwards

693
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,020
okay played the tape backwards

694
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,690
of reverse speeches

695
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,169
speech

696
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:24,390
but it's all but it's on intelligible

697
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:29,010
and did they looked at all of the brain
responses that various areas

698
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:33,260
and one of the things they discovered
was that all when you stroked

699
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,500
the person is all about the cause of the
the these patients have to member was

700
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,560
just to patients

701
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,809
what you almost see is

702
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:45,279
activation

703
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:51,090
in what they call the anatomic hand area
that part aldy sonata sensory area

704
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,090
parietal lobe

705
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,480
of of the brain

706
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,680
that alone

707
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,899
is uh...

708
00:31:55,899 --> 00:31:57,820
did who specialized for

709
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,580
smile tactile sensations the rights of
the brain

710
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,620
you can see these

711
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,630
and so that lights up

712
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,990
so at least there is some kind of
cortical processing

713
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,140
all of this particular part of this
particular stimulus

714
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,489
fault

715
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:17,180
they did the same kind of analysis

716
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,980
with verbal stimulation

717
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,760
and they found on that when they played

718
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,829
for these patients

719
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:26,440
you get activation and very few seria

720
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,730
all at least in one patient

721
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,360
one patient hard-fought unfortunetly

722
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,440
a lot of damage in the left temporal
lobe so

723
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,860
no question about

724
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,420
bradley's area working there

725
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,389
but the other patient didn't have left

726
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:41,370
uh... what atmosphere damage

727
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,419
and you can see

728
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,080
you can see it here

729
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,509
activation

730
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:48,249
in the uh... in the left temporal lobe
in response

731
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:55,249
speech quist

732
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,860
well once you start them once you get
the person this can you please real

733
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,490
basically can't control that

734
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,110
caller id

735
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,100
any longer

736
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,450
in the in this particular starting

737
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,730
what they did was to ardham the patients
were or wake

738
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,620
by the definition of having their eyes
open

739
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,009
all and they said well look this is all
we can do

740
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:23,250
at least they're awake not asleep

741
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:28,030
on and although they put them in
michigan this is pat scanning uh...

742
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:31,650
remember correctly

743
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,600
that's all you can do

744
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,809
really is just hope that you're going to
catch these people when they're at their

745
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:36,780
best and

746
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,440
these trials take a little while

747
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,200
counseling and some of their drifting in
and out they're gonna drifting

748
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,390
group

749
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,950
i'll show you all uh... all of them

750
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,590
for one more convincing study

751
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,530
in a moment but at least

752
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,710
all bob what was interesting about this
was that you could actually see

753
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,250
rain there is

754
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:58,900
responding

755
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,289
more or less differentially it wasn't
just that the whole brain became active

756
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:07,720
but when you touch the handy anatomic
head area became active when you read

757
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,819
people's speech

758
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:12,299
although you know about the cause speech
all of the speaker of the missionaries

759
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:13,260
karnicki seria

760
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,509
com contacted

761
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:16,499
here's a nice demonstration of that

762
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:19,599
all brain activity

763
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,059
in response to speech stimulation

764
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:24,959
an will be cut here are the two patients

765
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:26,120
palm and uh...

766
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,529
and controls

767
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:30,139
and what you can see of course is that
when you place

768
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,409
all of the speech forward

769
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:34,109
of course the controls or brain damage
there

770
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:37,129
showing a lot of activation and burn
ickies area

771
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:39,839
patients who

772
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:40,870
didn't have

773
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,419
did the damage in the left

774
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:45,630
for the hemispheric also showing quite a
bit of activity

775
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,190
patient one who did have a lot of damage
in the left hemispheres not showing much

776
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,509
activity

777
00:34:50,509 --> 00:34:52,489
can do anything about that

778
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,569
all

779
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:57,289
fall and there's more activity in the
left

780
00:34:57,289 --> 00:34:57,939
hemisphere

781
00:34:57,939 --> 00:35:00,199
then in the right hemisphere

782
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:00,859
palm

783
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:01,519
and on

784
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:02,199
and when you do

785
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,140
when you are doing first speech

786
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,259
what's interesting

787
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:08,420
is that the control subjects are trying
to figure out what that's all about

788
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,720
right so they're speech centers are
getting off

789
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,169
forgetting activated

790
00:35:12,169 --> 00:35:12,799
all but

791
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:13,640
not so much

792
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,710
with the you know

793
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,259
with the yield on that with the patient
so again

794
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:22,069
this is really more of an example of how
people tried to use brain damaging

795
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:24,609
two-track what's really going on into

796
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:26,219
they had to get evidence

797
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:27,019
offer patients

798
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:28,930
who can't communicate

799
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,700
through the usual kinds of channels some
idea about what's going on

800
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,859
uh... what's going on inside their heads

801
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:40,049
on here's another one paul that same
sort this is by parent and his

802
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:42,279
colleagues using about related
potentials

803
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:46,950
i talked about it dot new york he's a
little bit a little bit last time

804
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,789
remember that there are three components
to be your p

805
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:54,519
the first time milliseconds after a
stimulus reflecting brainstem activity

806
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:59,779
the next hundred milliseconds reflecting
subcortical activity and at all involved

807
00:35:59,779 --> 00:36:02,440
not the for the route reflecting uh...

808
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,150
reflecting quarter collectivity

809
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,380
so what they did was they recorded

810
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,469
all of this issue force vpn these days
late

811
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:13,149
although the cortical all bad
performance reports to reflect

812
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:14,359
cognitive processing

813
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:17,479
of the stimulus on in various ways

814
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:20,479
and so what they did was i cooked up all
subjects to org

815
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:22,660
would it would be jerry

816
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,920
and recorded the ventilated potentials

817
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,829
when the subjects were presented with
their own the first name

818
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:32,389
as opposed to

819
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:36,739
somebody else's first name

820
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:40,059
all four groups of patients this is a
very substantial study

821
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:43,009
some patients and uh... persistent
vegetative state

822
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:46,419
some patients who have been diagnosed in
the minimally conscious state

823
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:47,660
a group of patients

824
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,089
we're clearly conscious

825
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:55,349
but had blocked in syndrome and a bunch
of neurologically intact on age-matched

826
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:57,650
controls and again what we're looking
for

827
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,300
is the fate of these

828
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,049
consul called cognitive event related
potentials

829
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:04,340
that occur in new york ny

830
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,220
out here passed about a hundred
milliseconds

831
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,499
there is the uh...

832
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:11,779
there's the ah...

833
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:13,659
data for that we've got controls

834
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:15,439
stations of the vegetative state

835
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:18,529
patients in the middle in conscious
state and patients in the walked in

836
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:19,469
central

837
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:23,380
and what you can see here's the first
negative component about a hundred

838
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,819
milliseconds of out

839
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:29,899
and the controls are giving you advice
are done by strong response or response

840
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:31,619
diminished they have been

841
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:32,649
vegetative

842
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:35,059
patience and

843
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:36,999
interestingly less so

844
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:39,249
the mentally conscious state patients

845
00:37:39,249 --> 00:37:40,369
all

846
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:43,070
patients who were walked in argentina
and actually the least

847
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,469
glad to be at all

848
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:45,889
that's crazy

849
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:50,219
right and it's just a really wierd on
novelist solvable finding

850
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:54,689
because bio all accounts patience in the
walked in syndrome or conscience

851
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,179
so they should be showing

852
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:58,720
patterns volvo

853
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,070
above the brain activity that are
comparable

854
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,209
to those in the yard

855
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:04,370
salvage the controls

856
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:07,729
and they're just really not doing that

857
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:10,060
place where you see something really
nice is in this

858
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,910
this love focal p_-three component

859
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,459
p_-three

860
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:17,309
is a positive deflection occurring about
three hundred milliseconds out in the

861
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:18,929
event related potential

862
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,430
that's a response to

863
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,130
a distinctive or unexpected stimulus

864
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:28,230
so if you're trained to do play a true
dot patient or train of high pitch

865
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,830
stimuli and stick in a low pitch
stimulus

866
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,109
p p p p p movie

867
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:35,679
you're going to get a big peacefully

868
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:36,760
the controls

869
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,529
give me a big p_-three

870
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:41,689
the patients who are locked in on the
patients who are in the minimally

871
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:42,690
conscious state

872
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,929
give you are fairly substantial p_-three

873
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:47,569
the patients in the vegetative state

874
00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:49,150
not so much

875
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,020
perrine yet all that the parents of the
colleagues focus mostly on this finding

876
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,260
to suggest that

877
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,099
yeah there is some differential

878
00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:00,429
all of that there is some cognitive
activity in these patients

879
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:02,309
fall especially

880
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:04,869
the patients who are in the minimally
conscious state

881
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:06,069
as opposed to

882
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:09,129
uh... as opposed to the vegetative state

883
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:10,289
all but again

884
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:12,210
kind of an anomalous result

885
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,200
what's going on with these locked in
patients because they should have been

886
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,179
showing

887
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:18,730
all of p_-three response

888
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,669
comparable to that

889
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:23,029
of the controls

890
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:27,689
alright are same thing here here's
evidence of semantic processing

891
00:39:27,689 --> 00:39:31,489
lots of evidence in the controls here in
the here the the data actually works out

892
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:34,339
the way it's supposed to work out

893
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:35,590
controls showing

894
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,569
lots of

895
00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:38,879
p_-three evidence in the in new york ny

896
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,489
walked in patients

897
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:43,009
this bold

898
00:39:43,009 --> 00:39:46,849
this is the magnitude of the people who
responds

899
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:49,110
this is just what it is shown

900
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,660
change in the future in response

901
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,689
all the controls did

902
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:55,709
all the locked in

903
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:59,839
all of the patients in the minimally
conscious state show the putri response

904
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,480
just was smaller

905
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,180
only about half of the patients in the
vegetative state

906
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,609
this uh... chill dispute response

907
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:11,670
so again what we're doing here is using

908
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:16,289
direct measures a brain activity federal
arguably related to the person's

909
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,549
consciously

910
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:21,160
they resolved to see whether the person
is conscious

911
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,329
uh... countries will

912
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:24,440
now param

913
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,450
add up and and and his colleagues

914
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:27,690
themselves admitted

915
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:32,460
that the best evidence for consciousness
in their study in patients with no about

916
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,849
that minimally conscious patients

917
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,809
came from the p three response

918
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:40,880
but even that is kind of end big u_s_
because it turns out

919
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,999
that you can get the p pre responsive
lots of other circumstances where the

920
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:47,519
persons not conscious of what's going on

921
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,789
for example

922
00:40:48,789 --> 00:40:53,930
you can get the p three on even in
response to a subliminal

923
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,739
stimulus

924
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:59,309
okay so that's a stimulus by that by
definition the persons not aware of

925
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:00,730
if you get a piece three

926
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,699
to a subliminal stimulus

927
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:05,009
than the fact that you get a p three

928
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:06,259
in a patient

929
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:09,869
uh... in the minimally conscious state

930
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:12,450
necessarilly mean that they're conscious
of that stimulus

931
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,299
you can have apparently

932
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:19,160
psalm auditory processing some even
relatively complex processing

933
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,329
it being actually

934
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:23,310
without the person actually being

935
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,169
consciously aware

936
00:41:24,169 --> 00:41:28,289
of what's going on

937
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:32,809
here it is all but burgers where this
art area on the part of the research is

938
00:41:32,809 --> 00:41:34,080
going now

939
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,109
this is all of them

940
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:39,119
pioneering study by or one of his
colleagues out of bob dole journalism

941
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,410
big hole more research carpet on the
project on dot university of new van

942
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:47,400
and what this is a case study

943
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,649
twenty three-year-old woman who had
uh...

944
00:41:49,649 --> 00:41:53,999
uh... serious serious brain injury
following automobile accident

945
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:58,509
she lapsed into the vegetative state she
was completely unresponsive

946
00:41:58,509 --> 00:42:00,310
tour external stimuli

947
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,199
of for for five months

948
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,089
she got a diagnosis of vegetative state
precisely because

949
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:11,109
onto her sleep cycles seem to have been
preserved

950
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:14,569
and what though what all of his
colleagues dad was two wheel this woman

951
00:42:14,569 --> 00:42:16,379
into laos f_m_ are alright

952
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:19,409
uh... did doable into a magnet

953
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:23,829
and look at her responses to various
kinds of stimuli

954
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:29,569
uh... sometimes all the dividend one
case all played over here phones on

955
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:32,700
either meaningful speech sounds like

956
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,089
words

957
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:34,969
of various kinds

958
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:35,530
song

959
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,660
or just

960
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,709
noise

961
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:38,849
and in another case

962
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:43,299
they actually asked her to engage in
certain kinds of imagery

963
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:46,960
here part of the all the results of the
scans performed

964
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,309
during home

965
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:50,509
torino the speech processing

966
00:42:50,509 --> 00:42:52,920
and what you can see is that

967
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,319
for the patient

968
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,129
all good

969
00:42:56,129 --> 00:42:56,730
speech

970
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:58,649
not noise

971
00:42:58,649 --> 00:43:00,579
the all of the bed

972
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:04,279
roughly not all of the auditory cortex
but also some of their orders from a

973
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:07,550
very few seria is responding
differentially

974
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,750
not as much as in the controls

975
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:13,310
but you are getting a response and
you're getting it in the same area as

976
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,419
the controls

977
00:43:14,419 --> 00:43:15,500
which suggests

978
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,289
that this patient was able to make a
distinction

979
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:21,660
between actual speech sounds

980
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,910
uh...

981
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:24,869
non speech on goings

982
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:27,920
there is a very interesting thing but
that yesterday do

983
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,549
was to but while she was in the magnet
they actually aster to imagine

984
00:43:32,549 --> 00:43:35,150
that she was playing tennis

985
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,130
not watching a tennis game

986
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,849
aster to a magid that she was playing
tennis

987
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:44,709
of like hitting the ball swing in the
racket and on the and and and so on

988
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:46,729
when u_s_ controls to do that

989
00:43:46,729 --> 00:43:50,150
you get a lot of activation in the
supplementary border area

990
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:53,529
this is the next gyrus over from the
motor cortex

991
00:43:53,529 --> 00:43:58,950
all of them towards the frontal lobe
that this week preparers

992
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:59,609
motion

993
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:03,349
and so that's exactly where you'd expect
to see activation if you were a magic in

994
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,720
yourself swinging a tennis racket

995
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,689
control show

996
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:08,729
very nice activation there

997
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,839
but so did this patient

998
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:12,539
moreover

999
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:15,539
they then the estes patient to imagine

1000
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:17,919
walking through her house

1001
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:19,129
moving from one room

1002
00:44:19,129 --> 00:44:21,160
to another

1003
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,529
your house or some other familiar area

1004
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:27,729
when u_s_ controls to do that

1005
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:30,869
activation the primary motor cortex but
you also get

1006
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:32,199
activation all

1007
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:35,270
of the hearing in the poem portions of
the temporal lobe

1008
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,590
and you see

1009
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:41,089
activations and pretty much the same
area on in this uh... in this patient

1010
00:44:41,089 --> 00:44:45,039
what's interesting about this

1011
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:48,269
on magic yourself playing tennis

1012
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:53,789
magid in yourself walking through rome
or walking through a familiar location

1013
00:44:53,789 --> 00:44:55,680
that's a conscious

1014
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,259
voluntary action that's a deliberately

1015
00:44:58,259 --> 00:44:59,099
conscious

1016
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,119
voluntary response to instruction

1017
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,200
and this patient

1018
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,079
seem to be doing that

1019
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:06,750
even though she couldn't communicate

1020
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:11,880
for consciousness she wasn't able to
engage in overt behaviors if you looked

1021
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,239
just at the brain called brain activity

1022
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:21,580
by any standard argue would say that she
was engaged in conscious uh...

1023
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,019
conscious behavior

1024
00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:27,229
now very recently this same group this
belgium group

1025
00:45:27,229 --> 00:45:28,900
palm

1026
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,509
did a very extensive study using the
same methodology reported that just last

1027
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:34,779
year

1028
00:45:34,779 --> 00:45:39,739
fifty-four patients there must have
every comatose patient and

1029
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:41,979
thought that the other fifty-four
patients

1030
00:45:41,979 --> 00:45:46,239
half of whom had upper-level diagnosis
of persistent vegetative state

1031
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,209
about half of whom had uh... diagnosis
of mentally conscious state comparing

1032
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:52,910
two sixty nine called healthy controls

1033
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,779
and they did exactly the same thing

1034
00:45:54,779 --> 00:45:59,949
for each of these patients iran trial's
in which they asked him to a magic

1035
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:01,789
swinging a tennis racket

1036
00:46:01,789 --> 00:46:03,330
or to imagine

1037
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:08,400
all walking through a familiar heart of
the street or or or or house

1038
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,289
and they looked at activity

1039
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:14,619
in these regions of interest first for
the motor task hitting a ball in tennis

1040
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:15,020
court

1041
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,609
the supplemental all border area

1042
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:18,420
and second

1043
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,089
for the special task volvo

1044
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:25,249
aerial in the medial temporal lobe
noticed a parrot hippocampus drivers

1045
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:29,039
all of which we know is that bill
clinton's office involved in

1046
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:30,619
all spatial processing

1047
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:33,190
of various kinds

1048
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,029
here are there you know the although the
results of the stands

1049
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:40,559
it turned out they tested fifty-four
patients

1050
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,999
or only five of the fifty-four patients

1051
00:46:43,999 --> 00:46:47,319
showed any differential response to the
instructions

1052
00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:49,509
the other forty-nine patients showed

1053
00:46:49,509 --> 00:46:52,169
no differential responsible

1054
00:46:52,169 --> 00:46:55,249
for what you've got here are these five
patients

1055
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:56,709
compared

1056
00:46:56,709 --> 00:46:58,949
orthodox compared to healthy controls

1057
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:03,599
for the motor imagery the healthy
controls you're seeing called activation

1058
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:04,569
inbio

1059
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:06,219
in the motor cortex

1060
00:47:06,219 --> 00:47:13,169
and for the special imagery

1061
00:47:13,169 --> 00:47:16,039
your scenes of activation on in the uk

1062
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:17,349
the part of the temple

1063
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:19,729
area of media temple solvable

1064
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:21,929
and for these five patients

1065
00:47:21,929 --> 00:47:26,359
you're seeing the same kind of thing
here it's hard to see

1066
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:27,390
skoal injury there

1067
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:28,889
as you can see

1068
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:29,700
all but

1069
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,279
at least on the other side

1070
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:34,239
you've got are gap

1071
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:37,199
where your helmet

1072
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:37,799
palm

1073
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:41,359
all but at least you can see some
activation here in the supplementary

1074
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,769
public workers

1075
00:47:42,769 --> 00:47:46,549
part and you can also in the special
task see some activation

1076
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:47,660
in nam

1077
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,029
revealed temporal lobe

1078
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:50,739
on here's another one

1079
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:54,169
for the motor task seen activations

1080
00:47:54,169 --> 00:47:55,569
and paula little bit

1081
00:47:55,569 --> 00:47:57,159
don't hear in the office

1082
00:47:57,159 --> 00:47:59,199
for the spatial tests

1083
00:47:59,199 --> 00:47:59,680
palm

1084
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,549
here's another patient

1085
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:05,170
seem lost the top of the head here

1086
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:09,339
all but you're also seeing these same
activations so again

1087
00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:11,579
five out of the fifty-four patients
tested

1088
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:13,190
so that's a minority that's

1089
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,410
on basically

1090
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,429
nine percent

1091
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:16,919
all of these patients

1092
00:48:16,919 --> 00:48:19,380
so it's not everyone

1093
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,589
interestingly

1094
00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:24,259
four of these five patients for patients
who are diagnosed in the persistent

1095
00:48:24,259 --> 00:48:25,749
vegetative state

1096
00:48:25,749 --> 00:48:27,259
poorly one of them

1097
00:48:27,259 --> 00:48:31,799
had a diagnosis of minimally conscious
state

1098
00:48:31,799 --> 00:48:34,230
even expected to be back underway around
right

1099
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:38,210
the whole point of the dubbed the
diagnosis of middle way conscious state

1100
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,090
is if you want to be more conscious

1101
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:43,009
that a person who's in the persistent
vegetative state

1102
00:48:43,009 --> 00:48:46,319
but it's not working out that way i
think this whole

1103
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,410
diagnosis of middle econ two stages

1104
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:50,929
very very very problematic and

1105
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:51,940
as they say

1106
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,659
more research needs to be done

1107
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:56,279
palm

1108
00:48:56,279 --> 00:48:59,719
these guys were ordered put those who
are the purpose one step further

1109
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:05,369
to see if they could actually use these
differential brain responses to

1110
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:05,969
instruction

1111
00:49:05,969 --> 00:49:09,779
as a way of establishing communication
with the person

1112
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:13,969
archive inspired by all that all of the
diving bell the butterfly purebred the

1113
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:15,140
booker seen the movie

1114
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,189
the patient with a locked in

1115
00:49:17,189 --> 00:49:20,969
syndrome who is able to communicate by
palm halt

1116
00:49:20,969 --> 00:49:23,320
why you're using identified i'd
movements

1117
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,869
to lower pick out letters

1118
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:26,400
on a l

1119
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,649
primal letter board

1120
00:49:27,649 --> 00:49:29,830
and what they did all with these
patients

1121
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:30,849
although those

1122
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:34,310
five patients who responded
differentially to the motor imagery or

1123
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,789
the spatial imagery instruction

1124
00:49:36,789 --> 00:49:38,040
they'd say something like

1125
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,839
okay

1126
00:49:38,839 --> 00:49:42,919
if the younger brass has some questions
if the answer is yes

1127
00:49:42,919 --> 00:49:44,559
imagine that you're playing tennis

1128
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,470
if the answer is no

1129
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:48,399
imagine that you're walking through the
house

1130
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:50,089
okay sing look at them

1131
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:50,770
differential

1132
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,319
all involve them

1133
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,190
brain wave there

1134
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,090
they did this completely correctly the
interrogator was blind to the correct

1135
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:58,679
answers were all sorts of

1136
00:49:58,679 --> 00:50:01,649
on all the holes for the methodological
by cities

1137
00:50:01,649 --> 00:50:03,639
one patient

1138
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:05,119
of the five

1139
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,489
of the fifty four

1140
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:12,140
five patients showed differential brain
response one of those five patients was

1141
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,539
actually able to use

1142
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:16,189
the all

1143
00:50:16,189 --> 00:50:17,990
does that these imagery instructions

1144
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:21,159
to answer questions on yes or no

1145
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:24,639
so that's not a lot that's one other
fifty-four patients being able to use

1146
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,419
this for communication

1147
00:50:26,419 --> 00:50:29,859
but daughters open up some possibilities
here

1148
00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:36,319
for on weatherford offer diagnosis as
well all as well as for management

1149
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,249
what we've got here

1150
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:40,839
here

1151
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:42,839
the persistent vegetative state

1152
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:47,859
and the minimally conscious state there
is some evidence of conscious activity

1153
00:50:47,859 --> 00:50:51,519
there's some evidence that these
patients are actually able to

1154
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,949
voluntarily respond ought to command

1155
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:57,389
you just can't see it in their overt
behavior you've got a look at something

1156
00:50:57,389 --> 00:51:00,849
like brain activity they were to see it

1157
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,909
kada qualify this

1158
00:51:02,909 --> 00:51:06,919
this occurs only in a very small
minority of patients the basque majority

1159
00:51:06,919 --> 00:51:07,999
of patients

1160
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:09,400
in these conditions

1161
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,149
don't show this differential

1162
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:12,989
response

1163
00:51:12,989 --> 00:51:17,129
and it might be possible to use this is
a technique for communication watson's

1164
00:51:17,129 --> 00:51:19,710
only a very small minority of patience

1165
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,720
show this

1166
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,400
different responding to begin with

1167
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:29,400
it's not something that weekend all rely
on

1168
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,350
yacht

1169
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,979
dubbed the published paper doesn't talk
about that

1170
00:51:36,979 --> 00:51:40,649
so we actually don't know whether this
predicts recovery or not i'm sure

1171
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:42,749
they're doing that study

1172
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:45,799
generalizing from the turks trust wrote
study you'd say

1173
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:49,189
the people at the best chance of
recovery the people or showing some

1174
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,489
differential brain activity

1175
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:55,130
but in this paper this is published in
february two thousand ten

1176
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:58,929
there is no such as no such follow-up

1177
00:51:58,929 --> 00:52:00,069
so anyway

1178
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:06,809
here it is a way in which we can take
people who are apparently unconscious

1179
00:52:06,809 --> 00:52:10,769
all going to try to figure out or
whether there is any kind of conscious

1180
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:14,070
mental life called their there at all

1181
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:16,130
it turns out

1182
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:17,629
sometimes there is

1183
00:52:17,629 --> 00:52:19,929
most times

1184
00:52:19,929 --> 00:52:24,190
these studies especially the the the
studies of the belgian groups

1185
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:28,009
of or open up a whole new direction for
research

1186
00:52:28,009 --> 00:52:31,659
on these very very very difficult to
problematic

1187
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:34,499
neurological conditions

1188
00:52:34,499 --> 00:52:37,170
okay next week's sleep injuries thank
you very much
