1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,220
volcano last time all introduced you to
the literature to some of the

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,050
experiments early experiments on

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,179
a phenomenon known as implicit memory

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,409
which i'm going to take as a model for
all of the experimental study of other

5
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:20,359
aspects of unconscious mental life

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,560
and if you

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,579
reading this literature even reading and
writing a swale for all of them

8
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:26,380
rosenthal's book

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,550
for example

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,139
you all along

11
00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:30,339
noticed that

12
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:34,010
there are a number of different terms
that investigators use

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,360
palm

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,040
to refer to this phenomena

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,170
i follow schachter in home

16
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,770
distinguishing between explicit
conscious memory

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,350
and implicit unconscious memory does
that work for me

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,330
on the question him my task is

19
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,380
why don't you just say conscious purses
on conscious memory logistic use those

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,480
terms

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,970
well polished

22
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,730
dud i asked

23
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,830
schachter about this once and he said

24
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,340
two-term on conscious just has too much

25
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,850
all spare baggage associated with it too
much floridian baggage

26
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,920
too much psychoanalytic baggage

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,350
and he just wanted to stay away from it

28
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,400
for him and for me

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,910
explicit means conscious

30
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,720
and implicit means unconscious

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,009
now you will see in the literature from
time to time

32
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:20,229
references to

33
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:20,720
direct

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,230
and indirect tests of memory

35
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,670
direct tests like recall and recognition

36
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,320
and indirect s

37
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,660
mike priming pets or savings that
relearning or something like that

38
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,400
and that means pretty much the same
thing

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,920
home

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,880
i want to avoid at all

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,250
uh... the the the direct indirect
distinction however because

42
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,280
it's not just that prime innocent
indirect test of memory

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,050
that is

44
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,119
some kind of

45
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,210
varies so dole's sneaky test that

46
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:49,940
lol

47
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,680
and get somebody to reveal that he has a
memory that is not reporting

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,780
it's not just a non intrusive measure
memory we're really talking about on

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,270
conscious memories here

50
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,149
priming affects

51
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,880
that occur in the absence

52
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,500
of conscious recall a recognition

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,269
and then finally you will see some all
theorist referred to

54
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:09,580
this same distinction

55
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,269
as a distinction between declarative and
procedural memory

56
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:17,900
or sometimes as a distinction between
declarative and non declarative memory

57
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,600
and that's just really wrong

58
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,949
that's just the raw fun way to think
about this

59
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,509
the reason for that is

60
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:27,719
the declarant or procedural distinction
in cognitive science psychology in

61
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,919
cognos lives

62
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,399
refers to

63
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,809
format in which knowledge is represented

64
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:37,139
declarative knowledge is factual
knowledge that can be represented in

65
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,369
sentence like propositions

66
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:43,149
procedural knowledge and skill knowledge
that can be represented in

67
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:44,959
on

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,760
structures known as productions that
have a kind of

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,999
conditional

70
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:50,999
nature to them

71
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:53,229
you want to do with a then

72
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:54,819
be furs

73
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:55,979
and so

74
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:59,429
yeah it's true you could declare
explicit memories of a way that you

75
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,739
can't declare it implicit memories

76
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:02,920
but that's just a

77
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,290
that it confuses

78
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,080
the format in which knowledge is
represented

79
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,189
with the

80
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,740
way in which

81
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,449
memory can be expressed so

82
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:12,480
all for me

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,520
it's always an explicit horses implicit
distinction

84
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,349
all referring to

85
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,909
unconscious versus one conscious world
memories

86
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,869
one other thing i have to say is

87
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,690
all of the studies that i that i
described to you last time

88
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,999
involved the particular formal priming
donors repetition programming

89
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:35,569
and to remember be defined repetition
priming as a kind of priming

90
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:40,279
the prime and the target share physical
features in common

91
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:45,809
your primed with the word ash can and
then the target is a stem like a sage

92
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,969
that you're supposed to complete with
the new world with the legal english

93
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:50,929
word

94
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:53,540
repetition priming is the most commonly
studied

95
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,150
well called kind of prime news special
evil it in the literature on the

96
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,419
implicit memory

97
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:01,609
but it's not the only kind of prime in
you can get

98
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:04,319
and it's for that matter or not the most
interesting

99
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,419
are kind of crime you know it's amazing

100
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,969
how many studies have been performed on
repetition priming

101
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:13,629
a phenomenon that itself is

102
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,359
don't tell anybody

103
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:20,369
repetition priming can be mediated by
what we call a perception based

104
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:21,630
representation

105
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,729
alban event

106
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,400
all perception based representations

107
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,340
represent

108
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,600
thought that the whole or ordered
knowledge representations

109
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,569
the represent

110
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:35,039
the physical structure of an event what
it looks like what it sounds like

111
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:39,449
where it is in space are what its
relative location is with respect to all

112
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,569
other call don't bother robbed

113
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:44,610
butter perception based representations
dawson represent

114
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,620
the meaning

115
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,039
of the event

116
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:52,170
that is something that's represented by
army need-based representation

117
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,610
alm

118
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,540
all bought more like a propositional
representation

119
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,979
all deb represents both the meaning of
the event and it's so it's a magic

120
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:04,159
relations armenian relations based on no
m

121
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:06,650
on the among various kinds of objects

122
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,979
so what you really like to know

123
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:15,500
can the implicit memory which we know
includes all sorts of repetition priming

124
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,360
effects

125
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,379
can implicit memory extend to

126
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,280
also magic priming effects

127
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,790
that have to be mediated

128
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,290
by a meanie based representations

129
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,250
product of semantic analysis

130
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,870
that goes beyond

131
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,390
palm

132
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,080
just the physical analysis albee idm and
destruction

133
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,419
and there are calm as i say they're not
too much with all of them

134
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:40,020
or was torture on this

135
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,219
but there are all of the good examples
all of it

136
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:46,180
so for example what you'd like to see is
something like

137
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,860
category prime if a person studies the
word tree

138
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,849
is he or she faster to identify a
particular kind of tree

139
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:59,979
all of that that does the word so you
get

140
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:02,660
also magic relationship between three
and oak

141
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,370
and oak is a member of the category
three

142
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,990
or a solicitor priming

143
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,910
if the person studies

144
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,210
forward like table

145
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,870
can you get a priming effect

146
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,969
on a target mike chair

147
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:16,460
although the fact that has to be
mediated by

148
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,310
the associate of relationship

149
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,129
between

150
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,619
or and share

151
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:25,459
or you can construct autostart denture
actors dot a couple of times idiomatic

152
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:28,259
associates like sour grapes

153
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,289
sour grapes don't belong to the same
category they are not exactly associate

154
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,449
would prime

155
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:38,179
but the phrase so we're grapes isn't
idiom in the english so somebody's

156
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:39,230
studies so our

157
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,900
are they

158
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,739
now primed to deal with something like
of the the two was

159
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:48,020
idiomatic lee associated word

160
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,789
here is one of pearly study of category
priming and amnesia work by a gardener

161
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,269
is associates

162
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:55,929
where the calm

163
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:59,469
of those subjects did in fact study

164
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:05,169
category labels like tree and then they
were asked to make lexical decisions

165
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:07,120
about items like

166
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,020
or produce alm

167
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,689
or category associates

168
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:12,550
as old as free associates

169
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,319
and you've got a music patients and
controls

170
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,719
and you can see that the n_b_c_ patients
don't remember the items that they

171
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:21,180
studied very well on the test of

172
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,099
or kit would recall

173
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,369
but if you know ask them to generate
instances of the target i'll get out of

174
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:29,010
the category that they started

175
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,509
they show prime minister act

176
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:32,229
so on here are

177
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:35,629
on here the rest of the demonstrate
interest instances of targets they

178
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,600
didn't study can't be any priming

179
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,740
that's the baseline

180
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,400
and they show a nice priming effect when
there has to get very all instances of

181
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,089
targets of the cold front categories
that they did study

182
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:48,029
so this is a prime ineffective

183
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:52,470
that can't just be mediated by the
physical appearance all the work

184
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,099
it has to be mediated by something about
it's priming

185
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,120
and this is just a little demonstration

186
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,259
that shows you

187
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:04,720
on semantic priming can occur
independently or in the absence of

188
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,660
explicit memory

189
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,180
just like repetition priming

190
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,650
all i can occur

191
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,089
all a distinction between repetition
priming and semantic priming

192
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:16,170
becomes all but more important

193
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,890
when we get to the next topic

194
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,250
which is

195
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:19,650
implicit

196
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,369
or unconscious perception

197
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:24,060
descriptors okay

198
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,469
all implicit or unconscious perception

199
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:30,000
which is a phenomenon that's kind of
model dawan

200
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,870
implicit memory

201
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,870
in implicit memory we have

202
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,240
an effective a past event

203
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,350
study the word sometime in the past

204
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,420
the person's current experience for
direction like making a lexical decision

205
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,480
or generating a free associate

206
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,700
or generating a category instance

207
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,140
in the absence of conscious recollection
of that event

208
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,589
but in these could be in the case of
implicit memory

209
00:08:54,589 --> 00:09:00,660
the prime univ and occurred sometime in
the past

210
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,660
now what we want to know is all i can
you get implicit perception by analogy

211
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,650
to implicit memory unconscious
perception where you can show the effect

212
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,210
of a current event

213
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,330
an event of the current stimulus
environment

214
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,030
on the person's experience water action

215
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,110
in the absence of conscious perception

216
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,150
that event

217
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:26,090
this of course is the classic question
about sub little perception

218
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,760
sold let's do a little bit of background

219
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,310
those of you who were all living in this
country and all two thousand

220
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,500
on me remember this famous alba
political advertisement that occurred

221
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,300
ald caught in the context of the bush
more

222
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,760
of the presidential on campaign

223
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,460
this was a arm

224
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,080
this was a alone

225
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,070
uh... advertisement mounted by the
republican allowed that national

226
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,779
committee where first

227
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,870
you see

228
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,180
pole vault with oval algo rithm

229
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,370
go that the vice president

230
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,100
all and then

231
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,430
a whole bunch of words come floating in
on the screen like democrats uh...

232
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,340
dollop of taxes and things like that

233
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,300
and four

234
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,480
one frame of the video

235
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,090
you get this piece of the word democrats
racks

236
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,730
flashed off on the screen

237
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,310
and that don't followed by

238
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,880
all of the gore prescription plan
bureaucrats will decide and just another

239
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,860
repetition of the word wraps

240
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,690
and there were some complaints that this
was the use of some little advertising

241
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,629
all over the time to influence people's
voting

242
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:35,650
all by means of this kind of
psychological called uh... treachery

243
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,040
and their bed there've been a lot of all
i have that there's been a lot of

244
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,009
interest over the years

245
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:43,250
and whether these kinds of things the
hard part all affective

246
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,120
or not they'll have something to say
about that

247
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,970
at the end of the lecture

248
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,040
the idea of sub little perception goes
back a long way

249
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,980
widen its writing onto beginning of the
eighteenth century

250
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,759
argued

251
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,649
that calm

252
00:10:57,649 --> 00:10:59,959
in addition the conscious perception

253
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,810
we had an infinite number of what he
called petite perceptions little

254
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,190
perceptions

255
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,849
are governed that are unaccompanied by
awareness

256
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:11,320
and he argued that are conscious
perceptions

257
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,650
were built up all these called

258
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:17,349
of these smaller proof of the
perceptions road smaller percept

259
00:11:17,349 --> 00:11:20,660
that were not aware of sewing

260
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,020
dropping pebbles into our commitment
when aquarium or something

261
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,950
all you don't see those pebbles but as
they fall on top of each other gradually

262
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,310
they come to the surface that was my
dances idea about how perception works

263
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,480
at the beginning of the nineteenth
century

264
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,110
all her bart called

265
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,100
or argued

266
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,580
that there was an actual threshold the
german word is lyman

267
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,320
that has to be crossed

268
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
all by a percept before it becomes
conscious

269
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,040
anne argued that our minds work

270
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,609
for would be

271
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,310
percept

272
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,390
and if one of them gain strength

273
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,940
it push the other ones out of the way
and cross the threshold into

274
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,850
consciousness

275
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,660
very nice spatial metaphor

276
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,330
all for consciousness

277
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,700
on it that's the one big we became aware
of

278
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,800
but her heart

279
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,339
also suggested

280
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:10,159
that even though these although the cell
belittle

281
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,029
percept

282
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:12,700
syllable little percept

283
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,020
didn't cross the front loop threshold
into consciousness

284
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,800
nevertheless

285
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,170
they could all exerted an influence on
our ralph

286
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,490
on our behavior so one of the questions
for the nineteen th century cycle

287
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,610
physicists

288
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,249
is there really such a threshold

289
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:33,560
all the that a that that out of stimulus
has to cross percept host across

290
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,070
before we can become consciously aware
of it

291
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,770
or before if you had any effect all on
us

292
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,770
again whiteness thought argued the
contras perceptions were built up from

293
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,530
unconscious

294
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,140
petite perceptions

295
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,640
by french is not very good so i'm not a
good gonna try

296
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,560
of herbert argued that on conscious
perceptions have an effect on

297
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,530
consciousness

298
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,260
and a philosopher

299
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,379
c_s_ first

300
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,479
and his

301
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,730
graduate student joseph just roll

302
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,610
all actually decided to do well and
experimented too deep too well good to

303
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,880
test out this idea of the wyman

304
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,050
published six that this experiment in
eighteen eighty four

305
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,930
just roll was the first american

306
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,549
to take the them for the first american
to take

307
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:19,050
a p_h_d_ in the united states in
psychology

308
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,480
although of this is the first
psychological experiment to be published

309
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,580
in the american scientific literature
really lovely experiment

310
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,600
and what percent just road ahead

311
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,820
was to ask their subjects was mostly
just road doing this

312
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,700
are to make us all of us there is a very
difficult comparative judgments

313
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,389
they'd put to weights

314
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:41,410
on aren't all of the uh... alone on the
subject skin

315
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,270
they were very close together

316
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,339
or did not do not need in weight

317
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:49,240
and simply ask him to what george which
one was the heavier

318
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,420
or they'd flash

319
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,600
to lights and ask

320
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,399
release of the the observer

321
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,230
to judge which of the two lights

322
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,769
all were wrong of

323
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,210
where the brighter

324
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,210
all up and

325
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,740
all the help that the observer will get
worse

326
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,420
typically just roll here

327
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,020
had to make eight

328
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,140
art had to rate how confident he was in
his judgment

329
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,660
now sometimes the discriminations were
really easy

330
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,900
the ought to stimulate were far apart in
terms of weight

331
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,640
brightness

332
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,900
or other times p discrimination was very
difficult or because they were very

333
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,929
close together

334
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,740
in weight or brightness

335
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,100
on it at some point

336
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,110
all the observers confidence rating went
zero

337
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,720
the observer would say i'm sorry i just
can't tell what the differences

338
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,380
so there is no conscious perception all
the difference

339
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,589
and at that point

340
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:40,980
or the observer was forced to choose

341
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,800
which white was the brighter

342
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,110
for which weight

343
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,810
or was the heavier

344
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,620
here are the basic results

345
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,260
all from the stall them from this study
is from the weight judgment

346
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,770
all portion of the experiment with the
collected more data

347
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,719
here you have the ratio of the weights

348
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,290
one point oh six to one

349
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,319
one point no three one point oh two

350
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:03,040
one point four one five one point

351
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,339
of hold

352
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:07,520
the whole farted and so on just kind of
goes way down

353
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,990
are here

354
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,990
and all

355
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,230
this is transfer form is is to
alternative force choice ordered a

356
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,830
judgment

357
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,840
and here it is so above the percentage
correct

358
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,000
when the observer was at zero accuracy

359
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,959
okay when the observer could not
consciously tel

360
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:24,850
which one

361
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,250
was of which weight was the heavier and
what you can see

362
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,579
at all of these ratios even down to this
teeny tiny ratio of one

363
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,180
about five and a thousand

364
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,360
all of the difference

365
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,180
the all moody observer

366
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,459
was right more often then you'd

367
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,160
that they need be by chance and in fact

368
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,850
person just roll had to work out new
statistics which hadn't been invented

369
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,610
yet

370
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:54,290
are in order to god convinced people all
of that uh... that this act this value

371
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,200
fifty nine percent accuracy

372
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,630
or was in fact significantly better

373
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,680
that you'd expect

374
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,640
five chips

375
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,560
so here we have the first

376
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,520
expert psychological experiment
published in the united states

377
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,350
all by the first p_h_d_ in the united
states

378
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,580
are ended fund subliminal perception

379
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,250
and its own awful portrayed of
experiments

380
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,069
especially in the early part of the
twentieth century

381
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:19,419
trying to

382
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:20,700
trying to determine

383
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,360
all-weather on whether

384
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,980
did something like subliminal perception
is possible

385
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,330
that is

386
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,790
cannot stimulus

387
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,860
that is below the threshold for
conscious awareness in this case

388
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,790
the difference between to wait

389
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,100
is the stimulus

390
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,940
can a stimulus that's below the
threshold for conscious awareness

391
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,260
nonverbal less be perceived

392
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,830
and we can track that perception

393
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,050
all by vide the influence of the
stimulus

394
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,170
on the observers ongoing behavior

395
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,750
now in fact experiments like this
generated a lot of criticism and are

396
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,170
some of these were interesting and some
of them were not interesting

397
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,290
all above bunch of criticisms had to do
with what i call the threshold bugaboo

398
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,490
a lot of complaints about

399
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,160
threshold setting procedures

400
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,160
also for example you could say well the
reason person just throw got these

401
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,170
results was better

402
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:15,080
they'd invite that they didn't correctly
identified the threshold for perception

403
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,839
and what it looked like all got them
subliminal ordered stimuli

404
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,540
really word subliminal stimulus

405
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,069
that's an argument that

406
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:26,450
completely circular but

407
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,290
palm

408
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,770
or they say what what

409
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,250
the way we are dental five the threshold
is

410
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,940
buffer in psychophysical threshold is
the point at which

411
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,830
a stimulus the presence of the stimulus
could be detected only fifty percent of

412
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,670
the time

413
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,090
that's how we define a stimulus

414
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,700
or that that's how we define of that
threshold

415
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,000
so if you've got a job you get your
below threshold where the stimulus is

416
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
being detected less than fifty percent
of the time

417
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,690
it's still being detected some of the
time

418
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,690
and that might be enough to push

419
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,029
uh... performance art

420
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:00,310
performance above chance

421
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,210
but the most important thing

422
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,280
on something a lot of foreshadowed
involved in the last what was uh... some

423
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,279
of lectures

424
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,670
was a kind of theoretical blinder

425
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,359
that people had on

426
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,980
which was the idea

427
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,679
that home

428
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,070
subliminal perception

429
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,070
really has to be confined to what we
would call pre attentive perceptual

430
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:21,710
analyses

431
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,290
so all yes you can get these kinds of
facts with calm with all

432
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,430
all with all pr

433
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,120
physical analyses like detecting the
presence of the absence of a deal of the

434
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,630
stimulus

435
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,909
but you can't get anything interesting
out of it you can't extract the meaning

436
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,220
of a stimulus

437
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,010
although subliminally

438
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,530
precisely because

439
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:46,000
if there is such a thing as subliminal
perception by definition it has to be

440
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,350
confined to pre attentive perceptual
analyses

441
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,360
and the prevailing theory of attention
at that time

442
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,070
was that

443
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,350
pre attentive analyses were themselves
confined to a dollop two

444
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,140
on extract information about the
perception of the of the physical

445
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,810
properties of the stimulus

446
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,250
generating a perception that he's calm

447
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,220
uh...

448
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,160
uh... but representation

449
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,500
what happens is there's our challenge
laid down

450
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,910
not to do studies like

451
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,040
what pure sva person just road did but
rather

452
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,130
to try to dead evidence for

453
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,490
processing of the meeting

454
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,490
of a subliminal stimulus can you add
allies the meaning of the stimulus

455
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,900
that's not

456
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,890
conscious awareness that's where that

457
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,610
debate i talked about about between
proponents of early versus late flexion

458
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,220
that's without all comes

459
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,040
another bella another criticism i think
with uh... it was even more revealing

460
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,660
and this is all criticism that
identifies consciousness

461
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,000
discriminative behavior

462
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,250
any argument went

463
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,630
this way

464
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,120
the evidence for subliminal perception
whether it's a person just roll

465
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,830
experimenter somebody else's

466
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,820
always takes the form of some
discriminative response to a subliminal

467
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,649
stimulus

468
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:05,869
notice the dates here

469
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:10,840
these guys were writing at the heyday of
behavior is and they didn't like

470
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,230
thousand-dollar don't terms by cult-like

471
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:13,890
consciousness

472
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,730
didn't even like using terms like
perception

473
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,650
the only way we can define consciousness
is behaviorally

474
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,900
and the behavioral definition of
consciousness is in terms of

475
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,310
discriminative response

476
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,900
europe aware in something

477
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,690
if you could respond to it

478
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,690
discredited privilege

479
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,270
so in fact

480
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,220
any discriminative response to
stimulation

481
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,119
counts as evidence of conscious
perception

482
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,270
that's how we know somebody's
consciously perceived something

483
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,919
so but uh... on when this criticism was
directed at the person just row study

484
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:46,780
the idea was

485
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,360
jest role in the other observers were
just warm when they said that they

486
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,750
couldn't i'll proceed

487
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,620
all of the uh... the uh... difference
consciously

488
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,529
the fact that they could perceive the
difference consciously

489
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:59,010
was

490
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,490
gammon by the fact that they could
respond to a discriminative lee so the

491
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,460
trick here is

492
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,810
all no discriminative response

493
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,809
on can count as evidence of one
conscious perception

494
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:12,679
and the effective this basically is to
rule

495
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:15,470
fall some liberal perception

496
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,410
palm

497
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,020
opry or

498
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,419
if you can't come to discriminative
response

499
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:24,380
to a stimulus that you're not aware of
it as evidence of subliminal perception

500
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,930
what are you going to count

501
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,240
and if there is no evidence that can
count

502
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,740
because dispirited responses taken as
indicated consciousness then you're

503
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,370
never going to be able to home

504
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,940
to test this hypothesis

505
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,379
the other thing that happened in this
literature

506
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:46,909
is that there was a shift in method that
is that that that turns out to be

507
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:47,919
important

508
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,910
in studies of the sort gone by person
just ro

509
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,650
all dawn subliminal stimulus was defined
as one that was very weak

510
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,690
very small difference between

511
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,210
the weight of two stimuli or the very a
very small difference

512
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,810
between the brightness orble of to uh...
of two lights

513
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:09,739
and what happened to end up with in in
the l

514
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:13,120
early twentieth century assist move
overture began to build

515
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,690
is that all people began to use first
the device called a to cast a scope

516
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,349
more recently art other computers

517
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:24,710
to control the amount of time that the
stimulus

518
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,700
is present

519
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,109
so a subliminal stimulus is now

520
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:31,750
fall defined as one that is thought that
that is

521
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,960
flashed very briefly not necessarily a
low-intensity stimulus

522
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,880
but one that's very brief

523
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,399
or that's fine

524
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:43,720
except that we have this kind of memory
cold iconic memory

525
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,870
devil hold

526
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,700
favorable representation of a visual
star realist

527
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,970

528
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:55,179
visual system invision even after the
stimulus goes off

529
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:59,030
you'd be can't justify the subliminal
stimulus is one that's presented for

530
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,810
five milliseconds or something

531
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,730
the thought visual image of that
stimulus will persist for much longer

532
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,750
than that

533
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,970
for that reason

534
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,630
people developed a whole bunch of
masking procedures masking procedures

535
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,010
that effectively

536
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,559
all paul

537
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,559
you raised

538
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,440
this iconic memory

539
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,529
and on the phone

540
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:20,759
uh...

andrew render

542
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,190
visual stimulus

543
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,150
effectively or invisible

544
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,240
here's a little

545
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,740
figure that shows some of these mask and
procedures

546
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,230
here's up about two years old

547
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,279
technique called

548
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,860
phone energy basking we've got a prime

549
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,720
and a target

550
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,450
and the subject

551
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,650
fixate on this point

552
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,560
very bright light is flash

553
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,909
followed by the prime

554
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:46,150
followed by another very bright white

555
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,390
followed by the target

556
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,220
and what happens is these two energy

557
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,820
all of those stimuli

558
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,380
affectively vendors

559
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,510
evidence just bright light it's not of
did this not any kind of target

560
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,690
affectively all prevents the person

561
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,100
from home

562
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,860
from being conscious of the prime

563
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,830
so that's how that works

564
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,230
and we're talking about

565
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,440
this is called as a way stimulus on
cities agrees we're talking about

566
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,600
bug that acer craze of like less than a
second

567
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,919
here's a phenomenon called forward
masking

568
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:20,530
where you fixate

569
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,580
then that there is a fault that hash
mark hearsay rollbacks is new preview

570
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,610
warm

571
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,740
present the prime

572
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,129
followed by a blank

573
00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:29,470
screen

574
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,340
a lot and the target

575
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,860
and lift the this stimulus

576
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:39,500
onset they synchrony is less than about
called the fifty fifty milliseconds

577
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,430
all of the forward mask will effectively
prevent you from the from consciously

578
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,870
perceiving the prime

579
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,070
here's the same mask and procedure

580
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,640
they're very popular one except it's
gone backwards

581
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,000
you fix it

582
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,350
the present the prime

583
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,860
you present the mask and then the target

584
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,440
and this mask affectively

585
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,640
all-new erases the prime from conscious
perception

586
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,390
if you're one of these belts and
suspenders kinds of guys

587
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,270
you can

588
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,530
do with the forward primer

589
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,830
then present the prime

590
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,220
that a backward mask

591
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,930
and present

592
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:14,509
the target so there are just lots of
these kinds of of them

593
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:16,810
procedures are better off that are being
used

594
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:20,570
and all of them have the effect

595
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,029
rendering the prime

596
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:23,190
essentially invisible

597
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,179
well not essentially invisible

598
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:28,140
invisible

599
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,780
the prime

600
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:36,030
tony marcel anthony marcela psychologist
at cambridge university maybe use of

601
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,820
masked priming

602
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,679
all-girl indictment classic study
reported in nineteen eighty three

603
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,809
that demonstrated for the first time

604
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,799
all water known as mast

605
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,070
priming affects

606
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,330
math semantic priming effects

607
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,620
his subjects were put in august that
would be use one of two on different

608
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,620
procedures electrical decision procedure
in which they are asked to

609
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,370
they could to decide whether a target is
a legal english word or not

610
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,440
or a perceptual identification procedure

611
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,190
immature simply ask to read the ordinary
the target why don't apply what the

612
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:10,640
target

613
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,150
uh... is

614
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:13,820
and then

615
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,899
this case

616
00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:19,090
all of the targets were words like nurse

617
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,419
and dot masked prime

618
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:26,510
once they semantically related word like
doctor sold doctor comes up with the

619
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,260
prime

620
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,300
it's mask so you can see here

621
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,289
that nurse comes up as a target

622
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,840
and the subject is asked to make a
lexical decision about the word nurse

623
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,309
or to identify

624
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:37,370
of the legal

625
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,030
the word mirrors

626
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,570
and so that the target is always
presented super liberally you can see it

627
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,690
clearly

628
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:49,320
the primers presented sublet only in the
sense that its exposure

629
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,710
mast

630
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,120
so the subjects do not see

631
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,360
the prime

632
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,160
but the rest to do something with this
target burst

633
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,390
and the question is

634
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,290
can you see upright mean effect

635
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:06,780
the sailboat does the master
presentation i'll be associated warlike

636
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,170
dr

637
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,320
facilitate

638
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,850
performance all of the whatever task it
is

639
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,780
on the target

640
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,000
and of course the answer is yes

641
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
here are all

642
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,500
thaw what one of one of morsels
experiments doggedly expert five

643
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,400
and what we're seeing

644
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,830
ins on some trials the prime in the car
guitar not semantically related so you

645
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,860
wouldn't expect to see any semantic
priming

646
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,399
on other trials

647
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:38,580
all of the primary target are associate
lee related like doctor nurse cable

648
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,059
chair so on

649
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:43,560
also you would expect to see some of
semantic priming

650
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,700
alm

651
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,659
but brielle prime

652
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:49,880
is pres presented just once

653
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,590
to for twelve sixteen twenty times that
doesn't seem to make any difference

654
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,830
all but what you've got here is
responsibly missy

655
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,890
all of them but you can see here is

656
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,770
there's a nice primate affecting about a
ten percent priming effect

657
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,430
called when the prime in the target or
not related

658
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,820
our response latency

659
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,980
is about five hundred and seventy five
milliseconds

660
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,040
palm

661
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,400
when the private target are related

662
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,869
response leads his vote five hundred
twenty-five on milliseconds

663
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:22,589
temper sub-prime in fact that's a pretty
nice priming effect or in this

664
00:28:22,589 --> 00:28:23,680
literature

665
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,930
all and so what martin what marcel was
able to claim was that

666
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:32,070
yes it's possible to extract something
about the meaning

667
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,220
all busted pollack of a subliminal
stimulus you're getting subliminal

668
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,169
semantic priming

669
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:38,419
where the priming

670
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:40,450
of the young the prime

671
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,679
has been rendered essentially

672
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,229
inaccessible

673
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,149
to conscious perception

674
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:48,299
by means of the mask

675
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:49,860
here's another experiment

676
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,840
followed

677
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,510
above the marcel did i want one

678
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:55,950
there's no called the subliminal strip
affect your number the stroop effect

679
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,840
from uga of from an earlier class

680
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,280
the subjects task is to identify

681
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,910
the color all big color patch

682
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,160
art that's presented all of the to a lot
of computer

683
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,440
and what marcel dared was to embed in
the caller

684
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,880
patch

685
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,230
a color word

686
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,600
but the color word itself was mast

687
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,470
so you can't actually see the color word

688
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,200
are sometimes the color word is congress

689
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,279
or other times

690
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,630
the caller word is

691
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,250
in congruent

692
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,760
or green or there's a very

693
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,000
paused ulm uh...

694
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,270
uh... short dog interval or hear and the
question is

695
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,559
will the mask presentation

696
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,350
i'll be in congruent color word

697
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,880
disrupt color naming performance

698
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,890
the answer

699
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,480
on is

700
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,660
here is where

701
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,250
the all of them color and the the color
patches presented simultaneously with

702
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,760
the last word

703
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,430
here is appalled by members of the
experiment where the color blue or the

704
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,190
color patches presented

705
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,570
a little bit after nor the presentation
called on of the word

706
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,040
and what you're seeing here

707
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,549
these are the income grew in trials

708
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:11,380
and you see the stroop effect

709
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,710
when the word in the pattern in
congruent

710
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:17,789
it takes longer to want to did to
identify the caller patch

711
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:20,889
when the word of the patch or conger
would

712
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:22,710
last time

713
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,260
all the way

714
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,610
across

715
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,660
all of this effect

716
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,870
so you can get a straw perfect

717
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,620
even when the word that suggesting this
drew perfect

718
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,629
not consciously perceptible

719
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:36,720
because or because it's been

720
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,600
all because it's been maps

721
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,330
here's another example of this message
from the canadian laboratory on she's

722
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,980
been americorps all that experiment

723
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,230
all be buried

724
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,370
v_r_ that the masking conditions

725
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,240
when there is no matter

726
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,190
you get a big stroup affect

727
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:00,960
or or the amount of interference had not
been color naming

728
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,190
follow you could detect the prime ninety
percent of time still pretty visible

729
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,369
you still get

730
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,600
austral perfect

731
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,540
all the subjects are detecting the video
of crime

732
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,580
all of the via the incongruity word

733
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,750
just barely above

734
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,100
and you're still getting that's the
significance drupal fact

735
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,330
and then when they can see the when
they're not the fact of the prime of all

736
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,330
poorly on twenty five percent of trials

737
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,480
the through perfect finally on finally
goes away

738
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,660
on the basis of this kind of finding

739
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,480
fallen

740
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,060
the magnitude of the strip affect

741
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,030
varies with the detective bility of the
problem

742
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,350
she's run an article

743
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,030
suggested that

744
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,440
we don't have just one threshold for
perception

745
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,960
in fact

746
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,450
thresholds

747
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:57,640
for perception which they called the
subject of threshold and the of

748
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,120
and beyond objective threshold hong

749
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,850
respectively

750
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,389
the subject of level

751
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:05,000
the subject of threshold

752
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,350
they defined as a detection level where
subjects claim not to be able to

753
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,690
discriminate perceptual information at
better than chance levels

754
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,559
when subjects a

755
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,500
i don't see it

756
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,530
the object differential

757
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,649
they hall identified as the level of the
detect ability

758
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:27,830
where perceptual information is actually
discriminated actions levels

759
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,000
remember the person just relax permit

760
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,040
where the the subjects that i can see it
anymore

761
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,679
by the response to choose

762
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,950
and he was able to choose

763
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,630
worrying

764
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:44,090
here somewhere if subliminal perception
occurs somewhere in this area of between

765
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,890
the subject of threshold

766
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,540
this is the threshold for conscious
awareness

767
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,470
this is the point where conscious
awareness goes to zero

768
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,350
and the object of threshold

769
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:58,370
this is the point where discrimination

770
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:02,120
subliminal perception explains or you
know

771
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,309
in roughly alone

772
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:04,980
in roughly the space

773
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:11,720
okay so there's number-one fresh old
their or in fact

774
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,720
now let's

775
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,420
see how you can call deb how you can see
this

776
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,670
we have

777
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,120
palm

778
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,990
the again its radio subliminal all the
screw perfect we're looking at response

779
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,040
latencies

780
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,470
between in congruent incongruous of

781
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,150
cellulite

782
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:35,330
here we have are clearly still
preliminary presentation

783
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,500
the uh...

784
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,399
i'll be all of the of the word you get a
big through perfect

785
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,700
you've got

786
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,740
mask that

787
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,670
takes the subject below the subject of
threshold

788
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,840
you still get a strip affect

789
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,929
when you

790
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:52,780
reduce

791
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,059
when when you increase the masking
ordered even further

792
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:57,089
taking the subject

793
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:59,060
closer to the object of threshold

794
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,990
the strip affect is home

795
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,579
is correspondingly weakened

796
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:05,460
and again the same thing here

797
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,169
super liberal presentation

798
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:08,669
big through perfect

799
00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:12,129
below the subject of threshold you still
get a strip of fact

800
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:13,859
down at the object of pressure or

801
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:15,229
it's gone

802
00:34:15,229 --> 00:34:19,619
and the same thing or here so that's
basically how duong road we would like

803
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:21,080
to distinguish between

804
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,789
the object of in subject of threshold

805
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:26,469
here's what i think

806
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:29,839
for anybody is interested

807
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,859
you're likely to get some magic priming

808
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:34,039
doctor nurse

809
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:36,119
kinda priming

810
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,899
when you were in this region

811
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:39,280
vera relatively close

812
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,799
for the subject of threshold

813
00:34:41,799 --> 00:34:43,169
the further you get

814
00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:47,379
to do toward the towards the object of
threshold it seems to me looking at the

815
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,669
literature

816
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:52,209
the likelihood of getting semantic
priming

817
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:54,329
correspondingly

818
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:58,509
all but you can still get repetition
priming priming based on a perception

819
00:34:58,509 --> 00:35:00,099
based in dallas

820
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,100
even when you get

821
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,860
very close

822
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,060
to what used to an americorps cold

823
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,879
of the young the object of threshold

824
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:14,549
this is what the literature on
subliminal perception looks like these

825
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:15,159
days

826
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:20,440
the stimuli are not sublingual in the
sense that they used to be subliminal

827
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,520
and the classic subliminal perception
literature

828
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,279
subliminal stimuli were very weak

829
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:27,150
stimuli

830
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,540
in the modern

831
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,400
subliminal perception literature

832
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,819
subliminal stimuli are

833
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:34,310
stimuli that's not

834
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:34,579
exactly

835
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:37,449
um... that's not exactly the same thing

836
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:40,279
but beginning with this pioneer in excel
experiment

837
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:43,140
by uh... by marcel

838
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,509
we're taught

839
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,720
we now understand all of them

840
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,489
pretty clearly

841
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:53,819
subliminal of the perception can extend
to semantic priming effect

842
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,439
as well as repetition priming effect

843
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:58,849
i didn't show you repetition priming
texas

844
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:00,359
they're boring

845
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:04,789
the really interesting question is ken
you extract some magic information out

846
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:06,609
of a subliminal stimulus

847
00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:08,489
and the answer peers to be yes

848
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:09,670
though it turns out

849
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,689
that there are limits

850
00:36:12,689 --> 00:36:15,659
which i'll talk about on nanosecond

851
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:18,759
so now we have

852
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:23,339
it was a perception can occur when the
stimuli are

853
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:27,039
we we know that that occurs when they're
when they're super liberal

854
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,300
all and also when they're sab liberal

855
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,410
now there are also a bunch of
demonstrations all been plus a

856
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,360
perception effects

857
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,230
in brain-damaged patients

858
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,919
who were having some difficulty

859
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:40,899
conscious of perception

860
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:46,069
the famous example of this is the case
of blindside described by larry weiss

861
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:47,760
cranston a book length

862
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,699
organ study of a single patient patient
d_b_

863
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:54,459
all dv suffered brain damage

864
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:55,829
in his

865
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:58,580
visual primary visual cortex area

866
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,759
although the area b_-one in the yard in
in the occipital lobe

867
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:03,599
that call

868
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,430
of rendered him affectively blind

869
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,939
in his left visual field

870
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:11,789
left visual field a bullfrogs

871
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:14,649
you could see clearly in his right
visual field

872
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,670
couldn't see a thing

873
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,679
in his left visual field

874
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,010
all gradually

875
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,919
this this is called a skirt alma or
blind

876
00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:23,759
alm

877
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:28,269
piled up eventually is blind field
receded a little bit so that it was the

878
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:32,769
lower left quadrant of his visual field
that he couldn't see anything

879
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:36,400
uh... couldn't see anything in but the
fact of the matter is that you presented

880
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,449
a stimulus

881
00:37:37,449 --> 00:37:42,069
if this aerial of space the lower left
quadrant of his visual field

882
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:44,529
you couldn't see it

883
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,600
what why scratched discovered

884
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:52,880
was that despite the fact that d be
could not consciously c

885
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,829
stimuli presented in

886
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:58,009
a blind apportion of his visual field

887
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:58,840
nevertheless

888
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,130
you could make

889
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,589
although judgments about the stimuli

890
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:04,219
city quincy

891
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:06,630
judgments about their visual features

892
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,459
better than chance levels

893
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:10,859
so that he was able to

894
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:12,919
when just has to guess

895
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:17,269
so i know you can see a big just guess
is there a stimulus there or not

896
00:38:17,269 --> 00:38:18,519
we could do that

897
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,849
better than chance

898
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:21,889
where is it

899
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:22,910
he could do that

900
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,019
better the chance

901
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:27,770
what it's four minutes he can do that
better than chance is that morning

902
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:31,209
is a moving faster slow is a papa right

903
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,239
is a horizontal or vertical

904
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,390
is a big recive small

905
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,289
in each of these cases

906
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:39,430
didi cad

907
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,090
judgments

908
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,969
guesses about the stimulus

909
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:44,340
better pensions

910
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,469
levels they're not great but they're
better than chance levels

911
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:48,299
all

912
00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:48,959
even though

913
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:53,019
he cannot see the stimulus and we can
see the stimulus

914
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:54,090
he's blind

915
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:58,149
and that portion ald visual spaces
cortical blindness

916
00:38:58,149 --> 00:38:59,509
here's a nice example

917
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:00,789
although this

918
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:02,469
so long

919
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:03,919
kal

920
00:39:03,919 --> 00:39:07,479
indeed in this particular experiment
phoebe was simply ask appoint his finger

921
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:10,319
where the stimulus was

922
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:13,170
and if the stimulus is presented it is
intact

923
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,119
visual field

924
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,890
he's precisely accurate complete right
at the stimulus

925
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,159
if the stimulus is presented

926
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,860
uh... in his own sga thoma those blind
portion space

927
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,859
he's still pretty good

928
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:27,029
the screws up here

929
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:28,409
once in awhile

930
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:29,359
he's of

931
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,339
is pretty good

932
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:31,250
about uh...

933
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,269
about that

934
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:36,990
here is on the other example this is
perception of orientation

935
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,099
palm here is asked

936
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:42,329
judge whether this though whether a bar
is

937
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:43,749
horizontal or vertical

938
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,189
and he does that

939
00:39:45,189 --> 00:39:47,029
very well be right

940
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:48,819
almost every time

941
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:52,790
parties asked to discriminate between a
vertical bar

942
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,769
and a diagonal bar

943
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:55,710
he's right

944
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,099
over ninety percent of the time

945
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:03,070
if he's asked to discriminate between
haldeman stimulus extra stimulus o

946
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,650
he's right

947
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:08,839
almost ninety percent of the time he
can't see the stimulus

948
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:09,970
but he can make

949
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:15,479
akbar though chance of guesses about the
physical properties of the stimulus

950
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,550
that or ralph

951
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,799
that are better than chance

952
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:19,640
palm

953
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,869
here's another one this is a very very
subtle test

954
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:26,469
onwards act i've been asked to detect
what's known as the grading

955
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:27,899
here we have

956
00:40:27,899 --> 00:40:31,859
called bob examples of what or the what
grade he looks like

957
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:33,869
could barely see

958
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:37,409
like you don't want any broader goal
lines here

959
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:41,789
you can begin to see some vertical lines
here

960
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:44,560
easier to see them here very easy to see
them

961
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,759
uh... load here

962
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:49,979
graders

963
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:53,299
measured in terms of the with of these
bars

964
00:40:53,299 --> 00:40:55,069
and evolving

965
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:56,410
baby is simply asked

966
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:01,729
is for that is the stimulus or the
graded or all of the great it or not

967
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:03,359
chance levels

968
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:03,780
and

969
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,370
is that the sales has presented in the

970
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,039
part in the impact portion

971
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,200
of his visual field

972
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,159
is pretty good

973
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:13,799
if the studios has presented in a script
alma

974
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:15,529
he's still pretty good

975
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:16,290
especially with

976
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:18,689
the wider stimulus

977
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:22,549
so he fails when there's very little

978
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:23,470
in the grading

979
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,970
but the fact that he can detect a great
enough all

980
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,819
when he can't see the stimulus

981
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,929
what account for something

982
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:33,309
so we've got to poland we've got this

983
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:34,889
there's one patient

984
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:37,819
i know where you're going to them

985
00:41:37,819 --> 00:41:39,439
despite the next dog question

986
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:41,679
there's also a phenomenon of deaf
hearing

987
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:43,440
here is patient on a daily

988
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,899
who sustained a traumatic cause injury
to arm

989
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:51,859
to the oil primary auditory area anyone
in the temporal lobe has been called

990
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:54,769
kore dekh li death nothing wrong with
his ears

991
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:56,439
ald and it turns out

992
00:41:56,439 --> 00:41:59,399
that home

993
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:03,630
by a can detect the presence of an
auditory stimulus

994
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,109
just as well as control subjects do

995
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:10,339
bacall soul localize the auditory
stimulus whether it's front or back or

996
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:11,899
uh... or the side

997
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:15,569
all pretty well

998
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:18,919
saving about the language of the
stimulus you can't distinguish between a

999
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:21,529
melody and just of the pure tone

1000
00:42:21,529 --> 00:42:23,790
all but he can make some judgments

1001
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:29,099
about an auditory stimulus that he
simply cannot hear he has no conscious

1002
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,559
experience appearing

1003
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:32,809
and i don't have a slide for it but
there's also

1004
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:33,849
one patient

1005
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:36,839
actually there couple patients now

1006
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:37,649
nonsense

1007
00:42:37,649 --> 00:42:38,509
they have

1008
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:43,509
on damage to the primary somatosensory
cortex in the priore

1009
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:47,960
followed a don't have the conscious
experience of tactile sensation

1010
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,779
but yet they can make certain tactile
discriminations

1011
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:56,509
outside all outside of awareness

1012
00:42:56,509 --> 00:43:00,769
on here's another phenomenon where you
can see implicit perception of work

1013
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:04,299
this is a phenomenon known as pro so
peggy no joke

1014
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:09,229
alm per person purposes will justify dog
ordered define problem for possible

1015
00:43:09,229 --> 00:43:10,009
nausea

1016
00:43:10,009 --> 00:43:13,130
as with the inability of a patient to

1017
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:15,059
recognize right down to fly

1018
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:15,780
faces

1019
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,289
that car

1020
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:20,140
faces a people who are objectively
familiar

1021
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,419
um... too

1022
00:43:21,419 --> 00:43:23,400
he could describe the faces

1023
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,760
it's a little purses got blue eyes

1024
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,010
all persons got tall brown hair person's
got along those persons got this

1025
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:30,669
person's got that

1026
00:43:30,669 --> 00:43:32,989
to describe all the features

1027
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:36,059
are and then the classic case they can
recognize other objects

1028
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:38,499
they just can't do faces

1029
00:43:38,499 --> 00:43:39,550
and all

1030
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,769
this fella phenomenon

1031
00:43:40,769 --> 00:43:46,009
the syndrome is caused by brain damage
all here in the home

1032
00:43:46,009 --> 00:43:50,139
although lower portion of the uh... of
the temporal lobe

1033
00:43:50,139 --> 00:43:55,099
of the with rosa fuse a forum drivers
what's sometimes called the fuse that

1034
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,589
face area

1035
00:43:56,589 --> 00:43:58,179
damage in this part of the brain

1036
00:43:58,179 --> 00:43:59,910
produces a selective

1037
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:04,689
inability to recognize objectively
afternoon your faces now that's an

1038
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:06,999
interesting phenomenon

1039
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:08,399
on

1040
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:10,539
russ bauer and his associates

1041
00:44:10,539 --> 00:44:14,029
did a really interesting all of the
study of course of a goes our patients

1042
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:19,880
uh... new york a number of years ago
that showed that they were able to

1043
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,180
palm make discriminate but they were
actually should ripple to show prime

1044
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,769
interfax

1045
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:26,930
from faces that they could recognize

1046
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,530
what happens here

1047
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,990
is that the subjects are

1048
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:34,499
prime with the name

1049
00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:36,089
mark you go off

1050
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:38,429
or the face

1051
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:38,960
photograph

1052
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,660
of all about the whole book a president
utah

1053
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:46,339
and then have to make some judgment
about an associated content associated

1054
00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:47,039
target

1055
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,929
and what you can see here where it is
where the name

1056
00:44:51,929 --> 00:44:56,219
fit or defend the the love the the
private part of the same

1057
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:56,810
remains

1058
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,150
you've got a very nice

1059
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:02,009
although facilitation effect very nice
prime minister

1060
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:03,940
compared compared to when

1061
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,229
the names are on familiar

1062
00:45:07,229 --> 00:45:09,049
the same effect

1063
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:11,530
we all go but when the prime is a face

1064
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,900
so here and all the subjects or not

1065
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,199
consciously recognizing the face

1066
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:18,799
a face that should be familiar to them

1067
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:24,019
fun consciously there is some perception
of the face as familiar there is some

1068
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:25,719
unconscious recognition of the face

1069
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:28,179
that produces these kinds of

1070
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:30,769
these kinds of priming effects

1071
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,809
one more example

1072
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:36,989
and that's from another girl logical
phenomenon known as hemi spatial neglect

1073
00:45:36,989 --> 00:45:39,509
is one of my favorite clinical studies

1074
00:45:39,509 --> 00:45:41,269
on a very special neglect

1075
00:45:41,269 --> 00:45:45,369
alm is a gardeners are the neurological
syndrome

1076
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:46,369
patients

1077
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:51,299
pay no attention to something that in
one visual field or the other

1078
00:45:51,299 --> 00:45:52,900
on usually occurs

1079
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,039
by virtue of damage in the right
hemisphere

1080
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:58,400
part in this area basically where the

1081
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,869
off quite old and the trouble will be of
from two uh... come together

1082
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:04,720
all

1083
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,570
and what time we now know that dumping
these patients have a lot of difficulty

1084
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:09,809
of pending

1085
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,979
damages on the right or the business in
the right side of the brain

1086
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:17,719
they have a lot of difficulty attending
to the left portion

1087
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:19,309
so for example

1088
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,449
here in some clinical tests

1089
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:23,270
if you ask such a patient

1090
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,979
to draw a flower

1091
00:46:25,979 --> 00:46:29,559
still draw a flower but they'll leave
off the left side of the flower

1092
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:33,079
the left leaf isn't here

1093
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:34,089
hard here

1094
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:37,710
if you give them a bunch of of wines and
ask them simply too

1095
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,430
all of them

1096
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,380
put a yacht

1097
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,200
or they'll put a line through each of
them

1098
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:47,009
you know they would find for the lines
that are in the right side of the paper

1099
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:49,349
the lines that are on

1100
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:50,929
are left side of the paper

1101
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:54,119
if your present them with along the
horizontal line

1102
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:57,529
and u_s_ withdrawal vertical line right
in the middle of it

1103
00:46:57,529 --> 00:47:00,129
they'll put their burka line

1104
00:47:00,129 --> 00:47:03,579
a quarter third of the way across it's
as if they don't see

1105
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:05,929
this part of space

1106
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:08,259
if you present the word like this

1107
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,329
cowboy

1108
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:11,400
rape in the center of their visual field

1109
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,369
and ask them to read the word

1110
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:16,219
they'll tell you the word is boring

1111
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:17,839
we'll miss

1112
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:19,029
they won't read

1113
00:47:19,029 --> 00:47:19,550
cowboy

1114
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,229
they are inattentive

1115
00:47:22,229 --> 00:47:25,670
of wall of space

1116
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:29,489
marshall and how we're going to british
alguna duda ro psychologist performed a

1117
00:47:29,489 --> 00:47:31,099
really interesting study

1118
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:34,009
palm or the though dot on couple of
years ago

1119
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:35,999
in which they asked patients

1120
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:37,259
to all

1121
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:39,639
to examine

1122
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:42,470
almost identical line drawings of
something

1123
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:47,209
for example like of like a house

1124
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:50,589
the first test will go on for the
subjects was to ask if there was any

1125
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:52,759
difference between them

1126
00:47:52,759 --> 00:47:54,049
neglect patients

1127
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:57,049
don't pay any attention to the left part
of space

1128
00:47:57,049 --> 00:48:00,829
they say now they're the same

1129
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:02,449
even though this one's got

1130
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:04,929
smoke coming out of it for something
like that

1131
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:08,120
but then what marcia lamb elegant did
was to ask

1132
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,979
well which one would you rather live in

1133
00:48:11,979 --> 00:48:16,429
let me ask which one would you rather
live in is the neglect patients

1134
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:18,239
are almost always chose

1135
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:21,779
siong the that the impact house

1136
00:48:21,779 --> 00:48:24,869
and that doesn't happen

1137
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,430
you reverse the image

1138
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:29,699
so that the fire in the smoke is in the
right

1139
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:30,799
albums of space

1140
00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:32,479
if you were asked subjects

1141
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:34,569
a good usc seeing patients

1142
00:48:34,569 --> 00:48:37,989
but there's a difference between the two
houses there they'll say yes

1143
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:41,239
and if you go on and stable which one
would you rather live in they look at

1144
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:43,459
you like you're a moron

1145
00:48:43,459 --> 00:48:46,699
polum principle of course would rather
live in uh... live in this one

1146
00:48:46,699 --> 00:48:50,439
the subjects are not consciously aware

1147
00:48:50,439 --> 00:48:55,219
of this feature of the visual stimulus
yet they seem to be responding to what

1148
00:48:55,219 --> 00:48:56,640
they seem to be

1149
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,309
of

1150
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,800
they seem to be at all

1151
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,319
uh... taking that information in and it
seems to be influencing their behavior

1152
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,630
outside of awareness

1153
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,899
okay

1154
00:49:08,899 --> 00:49:09,859
all

1155
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:13,609
no i won't do that either

1156
00:49:13,609 --> 00:49:15,179
yall do this one this is cool

1157
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:19,999
this is an auditory example in normal
neurologically intact subjects doesn't

1158
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,569
work by eric wright who's a psychologist

1159
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:26,999
at the university of british columbia
use a dichotomous named procedure in

1160
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:31,429
which subjects were asked a shadow a
complicated pros passage that was

1161
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:36,589
presented to one of their here's and
ignore what was presented to the other

1162
00:49:36,589 --> 00:49:38,029
on here

1163
00:49:38,029 --> 00:49:42,489
already on attended channel in the dike
article are same procedure say heard

1164
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:46,200
paris socio consisting appalled a

1165
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,269
have a phone

1166
00:49:47,269 --> 00:49:50,779
a word that it has two different
meanings but

1167
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,549
the same sound

1168
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:58,489
all along with a descend biggie waiting
word like taxi

1169
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:00,529
and peace

1170
00:50:00,529 --> 00:50:04,390
later on after they finish the shadow in
procedure they were asked if they

1171
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:05,599
remembered anything

1172
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,349
all of what had come over the audit
ended channel

1173
00:50:08,349 --> 00:50:12,680
and because it was a complicated shadow
we cut their recognition test was of the

1174
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,049
recognition performance was very bad

1175
00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:16,119
and then

1176
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:19,660
all what i did was do what they say okay
now less than we're going to a spelling

1177
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,089
test i want to spell the following words
for me

1178
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:27,390
and he presented them with these
powerful

1179
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:31,739
how do you spell the word fair you can
spell it that they are really as in taxi

1180
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:36,319
fare or you can split so that they are
yaar as unfair plays

1181
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,699
you could spell at p_ a c_ is that
warranties

1182
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:44,229
or you can spell it p r_u_c_ as in piece
of pie

1183
00:50:44,229 --> 00:50:49,309
and what you see here is recognition is
very poor no better recognizing targets

1184
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:50,890
that morris

1185
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:57,289
faith showed dot strong tendency to
spell the hama phones in their direction

1186
00:50:57,289 --> 00:51:01,319
implied by the paris owes his presented
over the unattended channel

1187
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:04,140
no conscious awareness of this

1188
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:08,660
it prime their performance on the
spelling test a bunch of examples of

1189
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,539
implicit perception

1190
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:15,559
okay have a good weekend next week will
gobble gobble move on

1191
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:18,289
to a couple other domains of implicit
cognition

1192
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:22,200
and then we'll talk about implicit or
unconscious

1193
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:22,579
thank you very much
