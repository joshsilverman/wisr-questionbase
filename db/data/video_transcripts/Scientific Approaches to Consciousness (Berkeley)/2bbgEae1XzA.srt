1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,690
okay where we left off last time

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,969
was with this problem lol

3
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:11,980
the extent or what

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,199
pre conscious or pre attentive
processing

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,380
and the question that bedeviled
attention theorists for a long time

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,529
install does to some extent

7
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:24,339
is how much processing can you do

8
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:28,720
without pain conscious intention to the
thing you're processing

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,189
okay how much processing can be
accomplished

10
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:32,689
pre attentively

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,120
before you pay attention to something

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,580
and on

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,000
the basic all

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,510
all the questions

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,030
pose this way

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,870
is

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,819
preaching are pre conscious processing
or pretend to processing limited just to

18
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:52,190
perceptual analyses of the physical
structure of the stimulus

19
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,160
which is what the early selection
theories of attention

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,440
implied

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,239
or can pre conscious processing extend
to semantic analyses of the meeting

22
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,720
all of the stimulus

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,480
which is what's all implied by the

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,540
all late processing all theories of
attention

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,950
and as i mentioned all last time

26
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,869
daniel condom and any common tried to
cut through this

27
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,670
and said look

28
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,770
the yacht

29
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,730
the arp

30
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,090
determining factor here it isn't that
kind of processing that is it is but is

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,740
the kind of information is being
processed

32
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,360
perceptual information about physical
structure

33
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,910
versus semantic information about
meaning

34
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:39,060
dubbo the limits on attention really
come from the kinds of prophecies that

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,690
are being deployed

36
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,500
and he argued

37
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,350
allocate are limited to attentional
resources in lots of different

38
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,160
directions

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,359
what are called our car rolled

40
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,700
the potential resources or

41
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,070
fundamentally ltd

42
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,530
what happens here on weekend

43
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,279
became number employees relatively

44
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,610
enduring

45
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,210
cognitive dispositions

46
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,680
process information automatically

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,859
or

48
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:09,479
weekend

49
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,579
all did deploy

50
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:15,020
goal directed

51
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,069
potential prophecies

52
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,219
that are more or less

53
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:20,319
so the general idea here is

54
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,539
that you've got two different kinds of
information processing activities here

55
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:26,329
some better automatic

56
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:28,290
all of that operate on consciously

57
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,780
and some that are controlled operate
consciously and the resign introduces

58
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,160
theory is that

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,759
carmen was the first

60
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,529
to articulate this distinction between
automatic

61
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:43,209
controlled or automatic unconscious
processes

62
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,769
and the general idea here is

63
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:51,079
limited cognitive resources but all the
mother processes don't take up any

64
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,139
resources

65
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,769
so if you're processing something
automatically you can process a lot of

66
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,929
things that uh... that at a time or so
you can processes information in

67
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,680
parallel

68
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,959
but also depended on the what has been
automata eyes

69
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,669
dollar did give some enterprising stings
but on public place you can do that on

70
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:11,029
consciously of lord

71
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:13,480
so common introduced this distinction

72
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,239
between automatic

73
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,809
and overall unconscious and a conscious
or controlled processing that is

74
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:23,660
basically dominated the study of
attention ever since

75
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,770
it it's that distinction between
automatic and controlled processing

76
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,359
but i want to discuss detail today there
is the young

77
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,190
capacity model of the century

78
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,849
again

79
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,679
of will skip through the talked about
that a little bit last night

80
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,019
already reinforced

81
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:46,169
what the importance all commons called
the capacity through the tension was

82
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:50,629
in the traditional view the traditional
viewed as characterized by this

83
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:53,280
conflict with this controversy between

84
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,539
late or early selection of late
selection please of attention

85
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:59,639
there was a bill that there was general
agreement

86
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,080
elementary processes

87
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,939
that is

88
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,089
so called a bottom-up

89
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:06,509
information processing all that
activities

90
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:07,829
that focus on

91
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,009
hall and a lot i seen the all perceptual
structure of the physical structure of

92
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:14,250
the state was everybody agreed

93
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,329
that those were performed moral esprit
consciously

94
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,959
more or less outside the scope of the
pension

95
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,699
the debate was

96
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,069
all about another della about

97
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,919
guarded conscious prophecies

98
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,030
all of that had to do with

99
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,450
complex processes certainly that had to
do with

100
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,419
semantic org meaning analyses

101
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:34,139
and the traditional view was

102
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,439
that these tended to be performed

103
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:39,669
uh... could be performed

104
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:44,079
the revisionist view that comes to us
from carmen

105
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,249
that's not the report distinction

106
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:50,919
there are elementary prophecies that
could be performed pre attentively

107
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,069
get whatever they are

108
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:56,840
so even elementary mean analyses could
be performed preoperatively

109
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,819
complex processes

110
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:04,739
can become good can be performed on
consciously to provided that their

111
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,479
automatons

112
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:06,880
provided

113
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,930
that they're automatons you can do a
lots of complex things called on

114
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,629
unconsciously

115
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,840
pre attentively

116
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,259
as well

117
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:17,389
and to this prompted this new

118
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,780
that even complex processes

119
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,000
can be performed outside

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,400
boundaries of conscious attention

121
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,910
all beyond began to began to take hold

122
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,500
in the nineteen seventies

123
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,699
with a lot of research that was done on
various aspects of automatic processing

124
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,099
here's what we were in

125
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:38,139
fall

126
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:42,329
well buchwald of the art of the very
bottom interesting the comes to us from

127
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:44,930
our data burge handle and

128
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,479
producer nils

129
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,169
palm

130
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:48,119
from talking about

131
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:51,289
how we get a lot of it has to be in
skilled performance

132
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:53,620
and one of the burden samuels argued

133
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,490
was that there are certain complex
skills

134
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,870
that simply cannot be performed
consciously

135
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,919
this if you tried to perform them
consciously you'd never get them done

136
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,359
anybody here plays a musical instrument
a special if you play the musical

137
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,269
instrument well

138
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:11,709
you know that if you're if you're if
you're playing followed that with all

139
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:15,860
the line of music on of them clarinet a
red trumpet or something like that

140
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,610
you do not say to yourself

141
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,210
all i just press the key for c_ sharp

142
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,250
now i have to press the key four d or
the british or poor whatever if you did

143
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,900
that if you're playing the piano

144
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,549
you would never ever get the peace or
finish

145
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:33,439
rather what happens is that skilled
pianist

146
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:33,999
execute

147
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:35,529
called all the pieces

148
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:39,099
all of the automatically more or less
automatically

149
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,860
they don't have to think about what
they're doing all the time

150
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,949
they just play the please

151
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:44,479
and they

152
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,590
have automata ized

153
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,370
these all of the runs and trails of our
page it was all the other things that

154
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,120
they do basically by

155
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,329
by virtue of the fact that they practice

156
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,660
a lot more than the rest of us do

157
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,229
who were america

158
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:01,679
uh... near amateurs

159
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:03,159
so the idea here is

160
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,660
but if you're going to perform something
complicated

161
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,029
you can't do it all consciously or you'd
never get it done

162
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,469
some components of skilled performance

163
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:13,649
have to be unconscious

164
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:15,229
la virgin samuels

165
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:18,699
gave us literally definition of a lot of
intensity may somewhat

166
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,110
when you perform something automatically

167
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,960
whatever you're doing is immediately
processed in the long term memory and

168
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,009
that's the case

169
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,789
even if you're putting even if you're
paying attention

170
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:30,279
onto

171
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:32,010
durden do something else

172
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,370
so was killed piano player for example

173
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,509
might be thinking of the overall
structure of the peace

174
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:40,770
might be looking through the orchestra
conductor to see what he's doing might

175
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,090
be waiting for the violence to come in

176
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,480
although it or whatever

177
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,979
but he's not thinking about the passage
is going to be plane right now

178
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:49,750
because he's got that

179
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,519
if you will in his uh... in his fingers

180
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,509
now liberation samuels didn't use a
musical example

181
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,759
they used called the the example of
redeemed

182
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,449
which is something that everybody here
in the big in this role

183
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,720
has as a deal that there's a basic
cognitive skill

184
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,710
fiber to the fact that you spent

185
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,579
called something like the west thirteen
fourteen fifteen years

186
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:13,739
in school

187
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:18,099
what liberty samuels did was to go to
give an example

188
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:20,770
how weird is that we get

189
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,280
bulb though the words on the page

190
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,619
to the meeting all the words and are
heads

191
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:27,630
and they say look

192
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,639
what's that but what happens is

193
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,329
all the information you've got on the
pages what they call graph you make

194
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:34,470
information

195
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,600
like letters

196
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,520
printed on the printed letters

197
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,060
they said the process over reading

198
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,570
goes something like the following

199
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,940
the first thing we do

200
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,030
is we have this graphic information on
the page and we apply a set of feature

201
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,720
detectors that analyze this griffey make
information into its elementary features

202
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,300
so for example the letter alright
consists of a single vertical line

203
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,910
the letter s

204
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,620
consists of

205
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,390
open

206
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,060
curbs

207
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,750
the letter are consists

208
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,600
of a vertical line

209
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,030
and

210
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,870
and an oblique

211
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,380
the letter q consists of a close

212
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,860
and an oblique light

213
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,490
the letter p_ consists

214
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,240
angel about above the final vertical
line and uh...

215
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,310
and occurred

216
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,109
letter p_ has the same features is the
letter are except the letter or

217
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,120
has this

218
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,990
all that has a citywide

219
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,689
they argue that as we learned to read

220
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,269
what we learned to do

221
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:38,100
is to analyze

222
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,199
will do get the individual letters

223
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:41,939
into their constituent features

224
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:44,400
so we recognize them as

225
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,900
tonight and i sat sun or it's a pizza q
or or whatever

226
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,250
and they argued that these feature
detectors

227
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,950
are intrinsically automatic

228
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,800
that is were built by evolution if you
will

229
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,730
the presence of certain features
individual all good

230
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,630
individual all indicated environment and
we don't have to learn that we don't

231
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,760
learn to detect vertical lines and not
open circles and closed circles

232
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,569
that hold on innately

233
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:15,890
by virtue of soem automatic prophecies

234
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,560
and of course called

235
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,010
most of the as one of the most of you
will know all of their cuba land weasel

236
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,819
won the nobel prize in physiologic
medicine

237
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:29,889
by hard actually identifying called
dignity in the yard adat kat visual

238
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:33,440
system all of a set of future detectors
that through just that

239
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,739
that protect lol

240
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:39,059
a white dove of dark org dark spots
against white

241
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:42,440
background white spots against dark
background insults and stuff like that

242
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,930
the general idea is that

243
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,880
these feature detectors operate in much
the same way

244
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,210
but that's not enough to get you really

245
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,980
because next thing you have to do

246
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,699
is to

247
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:57,790
be able to recognize all that certain
combinations of features represent

248
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,720
letters in the word fiber fee all of the
language all of that

249
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,910
that you know

250
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,580
and those of you probably don't remember
this but if you've taken all of those

251
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,980
old above some certain foreign languages
recently

252
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,850
all you know

253
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,150
that this is a michelly effort for

254
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,470
on if you take russian

255
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,130
for example elementary russian words
where there's a very very different

256
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,200
alphabet or greek

257
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,679
you know that you have to spend a lot of
time

258
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,079
of growth low learning the difference
between all may go and saudi and

259
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,399
five-year-old that kind of stuff

260
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,350
it's a different

261
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,400
it's officially effort fault

262
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,440
and then once you get that one singapore
able to decode the letters

263
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,460
then when you add that as you learn a
language at that as you learn to read

264
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,220
you what you learned certain spelling
pattern codes

265
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,360
i before e_ except after c o it looked
like a let's solve it is a is a neighbor

266
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,279
or way okay

267
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,399
that's a that's the spelling pattern
code

268
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,029
that helps you again

269
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:56,330
all of the globe read the words that are
there in front of you

270
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,710
and then as the you have to put together

271
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,380
what matters and patterns of letters to
make and fire words and then all put

272
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,210
words together

273
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,310
to make employer called groups of words

274
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,840
and what of

275
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,580
what they are called la virgin samuels
argued

276
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,569
all of this stuff

277
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,430
recognizing letters

278
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,540
recognizing some spelling patterns all
the put it all together into words and

279
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,560
putting words together into phrases and
sciences

280
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,279
that's a nationally effort for

281
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,110
but becomes automata eyes through
practice

282
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,550
as you become a skilled greater you dont
have to think about it anymore you know

283
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,390
it's a p

284
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,119
you don't have to get all the decode the
word letter by letter

285
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:42,249
nobody here reads all they've been reads
it was caused

286
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:44,230
cut at talk tax

287
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,500
right you don't do it at

288
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,420
you just recognize the word cat and you
recognize the word cat because you've

289
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,450
read it over and over and over again
follows in two thousand sometime

290
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,779
all in your role

291
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:55,620
in your experience

292
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,290
but it started out hard

293
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,050
and if you don't believe me that it's
hard to begin but

294
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,570
take a look at what goes on in
kindergarten first grade as teachers

295
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,800
tried to teach kids to read it

296
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,230
most people get it

297
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,060
paul and they both of them and what we
mean by getting it

298
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,670
is a bit on a per work at it anymore

299
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,300
feature detecting is intrinsically
automatic

300
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,810
the rest of it according to this theory
of reading which is off

301
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,740
kind of generic theory of reading

302
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,910
uh... isn't something that's initially
offered full

303
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,060
and uh... bala traumatize through
practice

304
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,970
and that's the model for these things

305
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,220
now that the most demonstration of this

306
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,470
which is known as the stroop
interference experiment which most of

307
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,780
you probably know something hall

308
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,630
that bed shows

309
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,660
that at some point redeemed words which
to starts out as very hard for fall

310
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,280
all goes on on conscious or that you can
go on unconsciously

311
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,539
so for example

312
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:57,010
all in the dance troupes original
experiment

313
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,650
with the classic an experimental
psychology

314
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,270
all he would ask subjects to read color
names

315
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,260
home

316
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,709
or and all that

317
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,689
and would but the the trick here is

318
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:12,220
that some of the names were printed and
united colors were different

319
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,720
the color

320
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,950
that they named

321
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,960
and what's troop discovered was that

322
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,290
that turns out to be very hard

323
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,470
here's the data

324
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,429
from home

325
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:23,540
all but one of scoops experiment

326
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,210
here in this experimental condition

327
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,730
subjects are simply trying to name the
color all of the ink in which a word is

328
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,690
printed

329
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,190
that's all they have to do was named the
color of the egg

330
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,890
palm

331
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,709
all the uh... the trick is

332
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:42,720
that the word names are different

333
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,440
on here in the control condition the
word names the same color or it's not a

334
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,420
word of all it's just a block of letters

335
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,629
and you can say

336
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:52,899
that it takes people a lot more time

337
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:56,690
here in this experiment because that's
the same stroop interference effect

338
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,819
this is all but happened

339
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:00,069
after subjects did

340
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:02,209
two hundred trials the day

341
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:05,770
fort eight days in a row

342
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:06,720
and you still get

343
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,580
a little bit

344
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,630
of interference effect

345
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,180
alm

346
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,940
let's have a volunteer who wants to do
the stroop interference effect

347
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,160
anybody who saw

348
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,630
particularly feeling extroverted today
why do it

349
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,509
this is how it would be experiments done

350
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:26,839
this is an experiment in speed a
processing your job is to mainly inc

351
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,599
caller in which strings of letters or
words are printed

352
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:32,460
and do so in going to do with a lot
would

353
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,150
as quickly as you can

354
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,189
so these are the colors are going to see

355
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:38,670
that's we're going to call that blew up
there

356
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,610
jenkins

357
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,750
in thailand

358
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,690
green and brown

359
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,130
those of the four colors you have to
deal with

360
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,309
sold for practice

361
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:49,660
going to show you

362
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,060
short columns just six nonsense words
their dot meaningful words are just

363
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,550
letter strings

364
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,760
and what i want to do

365
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,950
is simply to pull out the caller

366
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,870
in which each of those nonsense words is
printed

367
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,890
do so

368
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,850
outloud

369
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,450
start for the top go down

370
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,810
and do it as fast as you can

371
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,200
you all set

372
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:17,200
no pressure here

373
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,340
excellent okay

374
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,060
now we're going to the same thing but
they are now there's going to be a

375
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,579
column of real words

376
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,400
rather than nonsense letter strings

377
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,070
and all i want to do is that

378
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,520
name the caller in which the word is
printed

379
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:37,520
forget that all you have to do

380
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,450
now we're ready for the real thing

381
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:48,600
okay those are just practice trials now
i've got four columns

382
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,830
words here

383
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,880
and their nonsense words

384
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,530
and called what i forget all i want you
to do is call out the caller in which

385
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,580
the word is printed okay there nonsense
words put so you can call them out

386
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,520
part anyway

387
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,850
start with the leftmost column go down

388
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,160
called to mexico will be no hope

389
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,160
donald uptown and will be finished

390
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,530
ari excellent okay now you know what's
coming

391
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,740
all we're going to do the same thing
again

392
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,060
all but alguna vez this time because if
it's a list of real words but what you

393
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,500
do exactly the same thing what should
tune in or the words

394
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:03,500
and just name the caller in which the
words are printed

395
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,500
hooker attacked

396
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,460
uh...

397
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,520
that's hard

398
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,570
okay it's very hard now there is some
tricks that you can do with the kinda

399
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,020
squared so that makes it hard to read
the words okay that that that's a trick

400
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,720
but

401
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,450
these subjects didn't do that

402
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,089
it's just very difficult and what's
difficult about what makes it difficult

403
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:09,080
is

404
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,640
despite the instruction

405
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,190
despite might clear instruction your
clear understanding structured

406
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,010
you can't help but read the words

407
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,370
that's bad they're very familiar working
for bid on time but i still didn't you

408
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,070
really remarkably well

409
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,620
all for all of them

410
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:31,600
for that both people achieved and a lot
worse

411
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,430
when you get to teach your own class if
you want to do

412
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,630
just remember

413
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,910
classroom demonstrations hardly ever
work

414
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,530
this one worked okay

415
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,559
but there are no sometimes you have
people falling down when they're doing

416
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,960
the strip testable with something

417
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,090
so anyway

418
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,200
that's basically

419
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,890
ald that's basically the strip
experiment here

420
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,900
and reasonable or way about it

421
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,710
all of the power and stroup understood
this even goes as far back as nineteen

422
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,230
thirty-five is that you would joyous
can't help reading the words

423
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,160
you read the words

424
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,160
despite the fact that you're intending
to do something else

425
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,720
they're all a crucial automatically

426
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,930
on note or the reason to get
interference of course is that read the

427
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,390
word

428
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,520
goes to all of the fault of the word but
no

429
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,779
your knowledge of the word

430
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:23,309
tends to go to your speech apparatus of
the same time as your

431
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:24,440
knowledge of the color

432
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,179
tends to go to your speech apparatus

433
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:28,150
and you only got one speech apparatus

434
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,360
right so there's a little bit of
conflict there

435
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,580
but the idea here is

436
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,530
you just can't help with read

437
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,830
farm own words

438
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,800
so what happens is on the basis of
experiments like this

439
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,100
hello birds and other individuals

440
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,960
on order argued for a new view of the
relationship

441
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,860
between consciousness and uh...

442
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,340
and attention

443
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,240
everybody agrees that there is some kind
of a quibbling so some kind of

444
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,900
identification between conscious

445
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,230
consciousness

446
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,929
and attention you become conscious of
something by paying attention to it all

447
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:02,720
day long

448
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,940
and and and all that

449
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,140
and that there is

450
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,510
some sense to the idea that there's some
kind of pre attentive processing pre

451
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,190
conscious of the processing

452
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,830
and as we talked last time

453
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,860
in early selection theories of attention
the idea was to pre attend a presenter

454
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,429
processing

455
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:23,140
was confined to perceptual analyses of
the physical attributes

456
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,780
or stimuli

457
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,539
palm

458
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:29,860
and all the late selection theory said
yeah that's true but you could also get

459
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,520
prepared to processing

460
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,229
detected semantic processing

461
00:21:33,229 --> 00:21:35,450
of the meeting for various kinds of
stability

462
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,460
and that debate between the early
allayed selection there is going on and

463
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,550
on and i'm still goes on

464
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,880
all but what happened here

465
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,179
out of the column and and others

466
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,669
began to

467
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:51,640
redefine attention not in terms of any
kind of companies are not limitation on

468
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,970
thoughtful on dont information
processing

469
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,140
but rather

470
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,879
redefining attention as mental effort
and the general idea here

471
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:01,120
is that automatic prophecies

472
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,680
dole require any mental effort

473
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,240
because they don't require any mental
effort they can be executed

474
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,370
outside the scope

475
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:10,940
or both

476
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,950
of conscious intention

477
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,930
you don't have to pay any conscious
o'fallon not it's not happening

478
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:19,860
all by virtue rating you're doing in
conscious awareness

479
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,830
and it's not something that you're
consciously controlling on either

480
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,920
and again the general idea is that all
up ta automatic prophecies

481
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,360
all have to have two forces

482
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,130
sol martin immediately automatic reflex
like

483
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,820
the operation of feature detectors
individual system for example

484
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,820
other prophecies because lord
traumatized

485
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,200
by virtue of extensive practice

486
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,690
whether it's the extensive practice of
reading

487
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,580
all of us

488
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,529
or the extensive practice at the piano
or the clarinet for the out with them

489
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:54,730
or the guitar

490
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,620
all four people who are who are skilled
musicians

491
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,789
and there are a lot of other examples of
this

492
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:05,020
uh... don't you don't get to see too
much of this of berkeley

493
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,529
but there are some people actually know
how to apply

494
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:09,140
a necktie

495
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,679
or and uh... that's something that once
you've done it for a couple of years

496
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,090
is something that's very automatic you
just do it

497
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:16,690
alone

498
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,920
on many of sports

499
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,500
related skills are done automatically if
you're a skilled golfer

500
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,370
or a skilled tennis player

501
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:29,040
on you just execute your strokes and on
that and uh... and all that were less

502
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,990
automatically

503
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,159
line in fact there is uh... there's over
bourbon legend anyway

504
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,660
that paid attention

505
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,630
laws that who was on such things as your
golf stroke will actually make it worse

506
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,700
on disco kind of

507
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,949
let yourself go get in the flow of it

508
00:23:43,949 --> 00:23:47,739
and there are lots of other examples of
favorite example dissolved writing a

509
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:49,530
standard shift kar

510
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,679
purists kill driver of the standard
shift kar you're not thinking about

511
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,620
pressing down on the clutch and movie
mode gear shift and odds-on switching

512
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,879
gears when the rpm is get above two
thousand or whatever it is here

513
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:03,889
you don't have to think about any of
that at all

514
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:05,270
you just execute

515
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,060
the uh... the are the prophecies
automatically

516
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,999
there is a

517
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:14,960
formal definition of autumn intensity
kind of a consentual definition

518
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,130
that comes from a lot of theoretical
empirical work

519
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,879
uh... that was uh... dot mostly in the
yard

520
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:22,730
in the nineteen seventies

521
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,000
and all you've got it kind of goes like
this

522
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,590
order matic prostheses apart

523
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,929
inevitably evoked by the appearance of
all

524
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,560
stimuli in the environment

525
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,980
in the strip experiment

526
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,769
there's a word up their red blue green
brown whatever

527
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,799
and you just can't help relieve
automatically a vote by the presence of

528
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,600
some stimulus

529
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,139
the second

530
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:51,159
consentual property of an automatic
process

531
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:51,990
is that

532
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,720
all that is what we call incorrigible
completion

533
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,790
once the process president has been a
vote

534
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:03,500
it can't stop it just has to run itself
on the run it's helpful

535
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,679
sometime this is described as a
ballistic process on the analogy to a

536
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,529
ballistic missile

537
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:10,270
which is shot off

538
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:10,980
admitted to us

539
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,430
goals

540
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,040
malval

541
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,620
and uh... that lands

542
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,160
or a boy

543
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,300
for that matter wanted shot

544
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,789
or what what what what what the
governors ordered

545
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:24,260
the bullet just travels and philip

546
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,840
falls to the ground by virtual gravity
or hits a target

547
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,930
or whatever

548
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,140
so that's what we mean by incorrigible
completion

549
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,589
fall by uh... the bard efficient
execution

550
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:35,800
we simply mean

551
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,440
that automatic prophecies consumed
little

552
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,760
or no

553
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,080
cognitive capacities

554
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,540
they require little or no

555
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,460
mental effort

556
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,049
in order to be a executed

557
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,070
alone

558
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,240
ando fourth

559
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,029
or the consentual property

560
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,730
is what's known as parallel processing
it

561
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:58,880
and the point about parallel processing
is pre sliced li because

562
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,789
automatic

563
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:00,530
prophecies

564
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,820
consumed little or no attentional
capacity you can do a lots of the

565
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,290
message same time

566
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:11,809
they won't interfere

567
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,419
propped on cognitive processing that
require attentional effort

568
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,590
the idea here is that you've got a
single capacity of

569
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,570
or or both

570
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,929
of attentional effort

571
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:23,140
and if you're doing something
complicated

572
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,049
that requires a lot of that capacity you
can't do something else that's

573
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:30,090
complicated and requires a lot of
capacity but if you're doing something

574
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,880
that's complicated requires a lot of
capacity you can do things

575
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,060
very complicated or don't require a lot
of capacity

576
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,570
phone of these probably his automatic
prophecies

577
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,880
unconscious in the strict sense of the
term

578
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,640
uh... the appraisal use a couple of
times did it and of course

579
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,500
of bye-bye unconscious we mean they
operate outside phenomenal awareness

580
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,290
you word aware when you are aware that
you were reading some color names from

581
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:03,500
time to time but you weren't aware of
the process of doing it

582
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,170
or and they also operate outside a ball
and terry control it's something that

583
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,820
you can't help

584
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,710
and five strict sense of the term

585
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,620
what i mean there is

586
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,990
there's a general view here

587
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,910
you can't com directly away are all fun
run conscious process

588
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:24,419
is strictly unconscious is no way for
you to become consciously aware of it

589
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:26,990
all you can do is to know what by
inference

590
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,030
and we know about these what these
automatic process eased by inference

591
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:36,140
from things like response latencies
send-off

592
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,150
the speed of speed reprocessing and
things like that

593
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:44,670
so that's the general consentual
definition of automata city

594
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,940
there had been some other properties
that have been ascribed to automatic

595
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,140
process ease over the uh... over the
years these arb although the more

596
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,370
controversial

597
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,230
for example then hasher and rose acts

598
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,610
all proposed to extend the definition of
water but the city

599
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,669
they agreed

600
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:04,840
that automatic process these work
inevitably a vote by the appearance of

601
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,950
the environment of certain

602
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,110
fallen or the

603
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,460
or affective stimuli

604
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,100
and they all agreed that automatic
prostheses were officially executed and

605
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,580
that they didn't require any cognitive
capacity

606
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,909
but they suggested

607
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:22,090
that if you really have an automatic
process

608
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,779
you'd see no improvement

609
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:25,059
in that process

610
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:27,710
with training

611
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,240
on you may have acquired

612
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,620
the automatic process

613
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,409
through training

614
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,690
and people once it's automata eyes

615
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,890
it's not going to get any better than
that

616
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,430
only if you're a skilled pianist

617
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,330
all they saw what you can do

618
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:45,400
onto to with or the only so fast that
the other

619
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,460
going to play or pay joan

620
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,500
as fast as so that you could do it you
can't get better their physical

621
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,540
limitations here

622
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,190
the second all above the proposal

623
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,059
that hasher exacts made was that

624
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:59,940
there are essentially no individual
differences

625
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,179
in the engagement of these automatic
prophecies of what they are really meant

626
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:05,100
by that was that

627
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,370
home

628
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,750
things like like you and personality
audra traits and all that jazz just

629
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,640
kinda been matter as long as you are
traumatized the process anybody could da

630
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,010
anybody could do it

631
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,460
they also suggested interestingly

632
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,040
that automatic processing is working age
invariant

633
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,899
that is once you

634
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:26,920
automata life to process

635
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,440
you can basically kept it

636
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,299
all and it did indicate of with full

637
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:36,789
that at least with normal aging one of
the fit one of the things we cn alleles

638
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:39,880
farmers disease for example in other
demented illnesses

639
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,400
is that would be info there in early
stages of alzheimer's disease

640
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,850
all of the than the patients can do
pretty well

641
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,669
so long as they recorded so long as they
were like just on the automatic

642
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:50,429
processes

643
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:53,430
but in the late stages of alzheimer's
disease even

644
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,300
the automatic processes begin to fall
apart

645
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,130
but in normal aging

646
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:03,370
all of the diesel automatic prostheses
seemed to be invariance across age

647
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,020
and then finally these automatic
prophecies tend to be independent of

648
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,250
arousal

649
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,160
small group called you could you could
do when you're dry was that you could do

650
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,480
the when you're excited

651
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,450
and it just doesn't matter

652
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:19,210
reasoned that doesn't matter is or
dramatic process these don't depend on

653
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,440
cognitive capacity

654
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,120
arousal levels will affect how much
capacity you've got

655
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,510
so arousal levels are going to poor or
or going to apec performance of

656
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,800
conscious processing

657
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,540
but they're not going to practice

658
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,960
beneath the performance of an

659
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,200
of an automatic unconscious process
precisely because

660
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,260
hardy's saw

661
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,740
prophecies don't or consume any kind

662
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,530
haldol

663
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,780
called cognitive activity

664
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,770
so now all this might be really familiar
to you all from other sort of the other

665
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,690
psychology courses

666
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,500
because you've seen something like water
but the city before

667
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,360
in fact the concept the cotton that the
concept of a lot of interest to be in

668
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,870
cognitive psychology

669
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,420
and cognitive science

670
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,370
has its roots in physiological
psychology we have

671
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,679
d_n_a_p_ eight years

672
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:09,230
uh... like spinal reflexes

673
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,550
that are on a bed that are displayed
automatically

674
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:16,740
on use of uh... familiar example see if
i could do this without

675
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,820
collapsing the table

676
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,250
if my position hits my patellar tendon
i'm going to give a patellar reflex

677
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:27,450
and that's a joke it's at the same
automatic stimulus response

678
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,760
min if i have my spinal cord

679
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,710
the of the art of final words

680
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,369
that are controlling the reflex

681
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:39,669
can't communicate with my brain you're
still going to get

682
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:43,340
spinal reflexes no

683
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,890
there's just automatic pistol cocked
kind of karna control

684
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,520
and there are other than a tax season
invertebrate animals

685
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,970
alaikkum all of this

686
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,309
of of the flying towards light for
example

687
00:31:56,309 --> 00:31:57,260
automatic

688
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,809
they're just built to do that

689
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:02,480
uh... and instincts like alone

690
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,840
imprinting decent things like that
that's automatic

691
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,350
loaded they're just going to do it

692
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,040
on condition responses plunder
traditional learning theories

693
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,150
traditional stimulus response learning
theories

694
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,480
were also held to be automatic

695
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,979
pablo once pat one dog

696
00:32:20,979 --> 00:32:25,970
learned the connection between the bell
and the me powder the idea was that the

697
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,909
sound of the belt automatically a vote
asawa very reflex

698
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:31,630
uh... in the animal

699
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,640
for thorndike's cats or skinner's
pigeons

700
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,850
or once they were in the connection
between the uh... between the key or the

701
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:44,080
bar press and all of them dot the food
risque for whatever

702
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,610
orbit but

703
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,770
the appearance

704
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,850
of that stimulus evoke the response low

705
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,130
you devote the response automatically

706
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,170
so that that

707
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:56,070
that idea was kind of carried over into
cognitive psychology and cognitive

708
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,559
science

709
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,990
with the idea

710
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,880
automata city can be acquired through
learning through extensive practice

711
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,430
with some kind of has

712
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,300
called

713
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,290
and then that the other of the kind of
corollary idea here which is not been

714
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,570
tested all that much

715
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,039
all in the laboratory

716
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,720
that one something has been automata
life

717
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,850
you can't

718
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,210
do you want um but rises you can't

719
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,300
make me you can put it back under
conscious control

720
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,640
no later in the course

721
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,740
when we talk about the experimental
literature on medication

722
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,320
we're going to feel probably not true

723
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,080
that one of the effects of at least
certain forms of meditation is to do you

724
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,730
want homicides

725
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,360
processing

726
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,600
so that you can reduce things like the
simple fact

727
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,550
of for example it's very cool

728
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:44,540
but we're not there

729
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,080
the next although

730
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,060
uh... but next all applaud that chapter
in this

731
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:54,400
are comes to us from our richard colby
done canadian psychologist now at

732
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,420
washington university

733
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,120
and uh... the for those who said what

734
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,159
the way we've been talking about caught
american controlled processing

735
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:05,509
we've tended toward the end of flight

736
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:09,210
automatic processing with certain kinds
of tasks like redeemed

737
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,410
and controlled processing with all other
kinds of tests

738
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,849
unattached

739
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:15,709
is that that's not quite right

740
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:19,839
you can it's not if it's it's not kosher

741
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,699
classified

742
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:25,059
tasks as either automatically or
controlled

743
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:26,459
rather he argues

744
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:28,200
every task

745
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,720
some components to it

746
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,669
better performed automatically

747
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:35,210
and every task has some components to it

748
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,789
better control that better performed in
a uh...

749
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:39,529
in a controlled fashion

750
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:45,079
and dick armey said about developing an
experimental paradigms double hours to

751
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:45,889
separate out

752
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:48,670
the automatic and controlled components

753
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,199
all performance of any kind of task

754
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,590
uh... and determine

755
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,379
there ought

756
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:56,839
and determine their relative strengths
let me give you an example of the kind

757
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:57,680
of thing that

758
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,029
thought he had in mind

759
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:00,609
here for example

760
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:04,139
called is all very dog common dalton

761
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,560
haha of the fighting

762
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,080
in the study all volatile dot beijing
memory

763
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,490
which is that there are substantial age
differences

764
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,630
in performance on a recall uh... bill

765
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,299
task three recall past

766
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:19,789
but there are essentially no wage

767
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:20,720
related differences

768
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,029
in performance on recognition test okay
so if you get older

769
00:35:25,029 --> 00:35:26,800
these are subject to their six days

770
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,320
you're not recalling things as well

771
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,649
subject

772
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:32,009
uh... do in their twenties

773
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:35,359
but if you're just perform or right
below the recognition passport doubled

774
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,180
which was passed through something like
that

775
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:42,499
there's no age difference on at all

776
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:44,469
fact it's an empirical fact

777
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:48,989
or that there is differences and recall
but not age differences recognition

778
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:50,809
puzzled people for a yelp

779
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:52,969
for a really long time

780
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:59,579
and george member avenue c ought uh...
of the san diego and larry jacoby again

781
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,639
argued

782
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,769
maybe arguments over slightly
differently

783
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:06,200
but they both of them said look

784
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,009
recalling some pena recognizing
something their very very very different

785
00:36:10,009 --> 00:36:12,249
cotton kind of cognitive function

786
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:13,489
defense first

787
00:36:13,489 --> 00:36:18,239
recall occurrence of as all function all
the retrieval of certain kind of

788
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,880
information from memory

789
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,770
you have to

790
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,360
do that consciously you have to do that

791
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,670
some kind of delivered way and it kind
of looks like it's got a lot of

792
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,640
conscious control

793
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,420
onto it

794
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,640
if i say to you

795
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,249
what you have purdue their last thursday
night faithful

796
00:36:35,249 --> 00:36:39,549
valuable doing thursday night where was
i who was having dinner with and and all

797
00:36:39,549 --> 00:36:41,479
that cuts have got engaged a lot of

798
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,809
on onto that building

799
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:45,459
called whereas if i give you our

800
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:48,280
or the two altered of course choice
recognition test

801
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,930
there's just not a lot pole vault home

802
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,500
old that that goes on they argued that

803
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,310
in fact a recognition can be
accomplished by either rogue troop

804
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,049
processing

805
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:02,130
invade some cases recognition is
accomplished by

806
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:02,900
retrieval

807
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,869
that is you consciously remember an item
when it's presented to you

808
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:12,349
but other times or recognition could be
mediated merely by of feeling all

809
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:13,430
familiarity

810
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,580
and the best way to describe this
feeling of familiarity

811
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,839
is when something rings a bell

812
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:22,059
you go to a party you look across the
room this easily

813
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:23,900
scene that person's were before

814
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,010
yeah i can't remember where yet can't
remember when you can't remember the

815
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:28,590
name

816
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:32,090
then you find out at your roommate or at
your roommate's girlfriend or something

817
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,559
like that

818
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,049
unhappy tell you i had this experience
once i was standing on a board station

819
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:38,709
looking

820
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:42,909
at the people across one

821
00:37:42,909 --> 00:37:44,580
obscene from someplace before

822
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,180
and then i get home later in the day and
it was my across the street neighboring

823
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:53,079
somehow i forget the subway stations all
that to you

824
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:56,120
i didn't consciously recognize them at
the time but

825
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,000
they rob bell went off i'd seen this
person somewhere before everybody's had

826
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,589
that kind of experience

827
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:06,719
all and the idea here is

828
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,989
this kind of recognition by familia

829
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:14,419
by familie already is mediated by what
we call on automatic priming effect

830
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:15,539
the stimulus

831
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:19,889
trigger something in memory and triggers
as feeling of memory

832
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:20,970
the station

833
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:25,200
between recall which is always a
function of conscious retrieval

834
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,450
and recognition which is sometimes a
function

835
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,170
on some kind of automatic

836
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,579
prime either a bell ringing process

837
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:36,559
on lead dog led both member and jacoby
to suggest

838
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,820
that what happens with with aging

839
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,489
is that eighteen impairs only a little
conscious

840
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,109
recollection

841
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:46,229
material and has no effect

842
00:38:46,229 --> 00:38:48,530
on on various kinds of

843
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,779
a prime minister

844
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:51,409
so jacoby went on

845
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:55,130
on board with with some of his
colleagues to study this process

846
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,699
and i'm just going to show you these
depth the since these experiments

847
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:00,659
just as a way of illustrating

848
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:03,280
how in general we can separate

849
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,500
conscious for one conscious process
these because that's good let's move on

850
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,730
set the stage for what we do arm

851
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,829
for what we talk about

852
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:12,640
on next week there's a little bit of
mathematics here

853
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,150
i don't want you to get hung up on the
map

854
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:18,270
okay i'm never going to ask you to read
reproduce these equations

855
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,690
if you want more information about it
it's in the lecture supplements

856
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,969
but i have to show yes

857
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:29,259
let's look at what i would add a note
that a couple whom typical kind of prime

858
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:30,369
minister actresses

859
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,549
priming effect from stem completion test

860
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:36,789
a magic that i've asked you to study a
list of words

861
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:38,569
density

862
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:42,059
and then after you started the list of
words i give you a stem completion

863
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:43,879
status

864
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:45,650
farm lol bis dams

865
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,700
part the first three letters all old
targets

866
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,700
old old study targets that were on that
were on the study of us

867
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,160
like do you have

868
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,839
which can compete be completed with
density

869
00:39:56,839 --> 00:39:59,029
and then for crowd control condition

870
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,690
new ones studied low-risk

871
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,249
like nec

872
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:05,579
that you haven't seen lately

873
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:10,419
and mobile happened when part whew when
this when when this happens

874
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:11,090
argues that

875
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,329
if i simply say

876
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:14,130
but i want to do is complete this

877
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,889
with the first word that comes to mind

878
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:19,239
that's how would you do stem completion
test

879
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:22,219
going to complete this with the first
word that comes to mind

880
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,930
most people will complete the with
density

881
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,599
because they're just study density

882
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:28,890
but there are lots of other words like

883
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:29,589
dentist

884
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:32,230
and dental handled and all of that

885
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,690
that work for perfectly good of
completions

886
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,399
but you don't think about you've been
primed by studying the word density

887
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:40,139
the complete

888
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:42,209
the stem deanne

889
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:47,439
that word as opposed to one of the other
all words

890
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:49,100
so now what you're totally did

891
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,990
was towed the body's aden part of the
addicted technique

892
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,169
which is called the

893
00:40:54,169 --> 00:40:55,910
method of opposition

894
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,299
which is intended

895
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:03,170
conscious controlled prophecies

896
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,930
unconscious automatic prophecies in
opposition

897
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,800
to each other he starts out the same way
we do in the standard done completion

898
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,430
test

899
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:13,239
this study a list of words like density

900
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,469
then you have a stem completion test

901
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:19,299
spectrum consists of the stems of old
studied target

902
00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:20,810
spends all of new

903
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,880
previously on the studied all morris

904
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,479
but he'd prefer to go forms a trick here

905
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:29,410
in one condition of the experiment
jacoby says to a subject

906
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:32,670
what i want you to do is the complete
each

907
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,690
stammer with

908
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,319
an item from the study alerts

909
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:38,909
and if you can't do that

910
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:39,890
just complete

911
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,869
the stamp with the first word that comes
to mind

912
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:44,620
also

913
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,869
for example a density

914
00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:48,640
the instruction is too

915
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,650
palm darden is to complete the word

916
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,390
of the complete the stem with the word
that you remember from the study

917
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,160
now if you think about that for a second

918
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,589
there are two ways you can do that

919
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:03,190
you can complete den with density

920
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,919
because you'll remember you study
density right you can complete the word

921
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:09,709
the complete the stabbed with a target

922
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:11,819
by virtue of conscious recollection

923
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:14,690
but even if you don't consciously
remember

924
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,069
the word

925
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:18,489
still by virtue of this automatic
priming

926
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:23,119
of the process density might be the
first word that comes to mind

927
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,760
so the inclusion condition

928
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,959
capitalizes on both conscious retrieval

929
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:32,150
and on unconscious priming

930
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,059
now we get

931
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:35,489
to the exclusion condition

932
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:37,779
in which to colby says stupid subject

933
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:39,769
i want you to complete

934
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:42,679
argued stem with and english word

935
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:44,389
any invoice word will do

936
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:48,819
so long as it's not one from the study
list

937
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:51,419
you have to exclude the items

938
00:42:51,419 --> 00:42:52,670
the study was

939
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,039
and if you think about that for a second

940
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,640
in order to excluded item from the study
was

941
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,969
you have to consciously remember

942
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:02,239
that it came

943
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,079
the study was

944
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,700
so the or did in the exclusion condition

945
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,939
the only way you're going to

946
00:43:08,939 --> 00:43:11,029
called for

947
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:11,959
diya and

948
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:13,509
with density

949
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:14,820
as opposed to

950
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,280
which is supposed to do

951
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,139
completed with the word like dentist is
if

952
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:25,739
the word density is primed by virtue of
the previous study experience

953
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,950
comes to mind automatically

954
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,209
and

955
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:31,799
you don't consciously remember

956
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:33,579
because of you did consciously remember
it

957
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:34,309
you'd save yourself

958
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:35,589
i can't use that word

959
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:39,829
i gotta think of some of their work okay
so uh... this way what jacoby tries to

960
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:41,469
do is to put

961
00:43:41,469 --> 00:43:42,260
conscious

962
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,309
controlled component

963
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:45,369
recognized or or both

964
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:47,259
uh... over of retrieval

965
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:48,280
in opposition

966
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,399
to the automatic on unconscious

967
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:53,269
on component

968
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:54,940
so now what we do is

969
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,820
bob we look at

970
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,700
what what jacoby did was to look at the
age differences

971
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,849
in performance on the inclusion

972
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:02,669
and exclusion

973
00:44:02,669 --> 00:44:03,570
uh...

974
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,749
uh... conditions of the experiment

975
00:44:05,749 --> 00:44:07,979
and what he get first

976
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,320
something like a standard

977
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,319
age difference

978
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,249
so the young perform better in the
inclusion condition than the old that

979
00:44:15,249 --> 00:44:16,190
you will do

980
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:20,009
and this makes sense because the
inclusion condition

981
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:22,719
capitalizes on conscious recollection

982
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:24,249
and that's something that

983
00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:26,760
elderly people don't do as well as young
people

984
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,319
until you get this

985
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,630
you get different

986
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:33,849
that looks like a difference here but
it's not a statistically significant

987
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:34,329
difference

988
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:36,320
in the exclusion condition

989
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,670
are basically

990
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:42,149
audit anything the all the performing a
little bit better

991
00:44:42,149 --> 00:44:43,010
young people

992
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:47,190
okay which is kind of a mystery from the
street willful uh... in a second

993
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:50,699
but basically here's the pattern a
performance

994
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:51,069
young

995
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:52,119
do better than old

996
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:54,169
in the inclusion condition

997
00:44:54,169 --> 00:44:56,039
the old to little bit better

998
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:56,739
and beyond

999
00:44:56,739 --> 00:44:58,470
in the explosion condition

1000
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,880
and i just called me argues

1001
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,119
that you can take

1002
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:03,529
they don't like this

1003
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:05,290
and use it to estimate

1004
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:08,420
the automatic and controlled components

1005
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,600
of performance

1006
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,649
and you do that

1007
00:45:10,649 --> 00:45:13,019
europe formulas were not going to go
through the whole thing

1008
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:17,359
but you can see the logic of it if you
just look here

1009
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,209
in the inclusion condition remember
items will appear in the inclusion

1010
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:21,789
commission

1011
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:26,289
are in there by virtue of conscious
recollection or by brit robot arm at a

1012
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:28,529
crime

1013
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:29,680
so we argued

1014
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,989
that you can estimate the conscious
component

1015
00:45:32,989 --> 00:45:34,869
of past performance

1016
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:36,230
basically by

1017
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,549
subtracting the number of

1018
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:40,420
produced in the explosion condition

1019
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,869
from the number of targets produced in
the inclusion condition

1020
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:46,400
the more you got conscious control

1021
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,880
the more you want to be able to x
consciously excluded

1022
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,929
i got on the front yard

1023
00:45:52,929 --> 00:45:53,780
and once

1024
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,359
you've got c

1025
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,589
you can just by simple eligible

1026
00:45:57,589 --> 00:46:01,380
find out all involved what what what job
what what what

1027
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,010
what the automatic performance

1028
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,039
oval but the automatic component of
performances

1029
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:07,650
if you're if you want

1030
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:11,440
with the whole story it's in the lecture
supplements we don't have to do that

1031
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,109
here it is bien sur

1032
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:18,410
we called about seventy six percent of
the items in the inclusion condition

1033
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:21,549
compared to fifty five percent for the
old distance from the figure i gave you

1034
00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:23,119
before

1035
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,459
young hotly recalled about twenty six
percent of the items in the exclusion

1036
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:31,499
condition about thirty nine percent of
the items of by the old

1037
00:46:31,499 --> 00:46:32,300
over these figures

1038
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,559
make sense

1039
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:35,670
the inclusion tradition

1040
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:37,959
capitalizes on conscious recollection

1041
00:46:37,959 --> 00:46:39,769
young have more of it

1042
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:42,119
they were able to exclude better

1043
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:46,209
because state consciously remember of
these items inouye

1044
00:46:46,209 --> 00:46:50,620
i'll bet that the elderly don't but if
you will apply to call these formulas

1045
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,650
what you get here

1046
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,089
all admit you're you're able to ask them
eight

1047
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:57,290
the automatic and controlled

1048
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:58,769
on blood components

1049
00:46:58,769 --> 00:47:01,669
on this it seems different from what you
get here

1050
00:47:01,669 --> 00:47:02,849
the following

1051
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:05,519
the age difference and recognition

1052
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:08,219
okay huge difference in stem completion
whatever

1053
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:11,519
is due in part early pick age
differences

1054
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:13,869
the controlled component

1055
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:16,089
past performance

1056
00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:18,169
there's no age difference

1057
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:21,959
in the automatic controlled by the new
york another component the past

1058
00:47:21,959 --> 00:47:22,340
performance

1059
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,680
and that's exactly what

1060
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,250
for example hatchery veterans acts

1061
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,669
would have predicted

1062
00:47:29,669 --> 00:47:31,380
so here what we've got

1063
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,769
is a technique

1064
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:34,769
the method of opposition

1065
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,979
which tries to put

1066
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,289
automatic uncontrolled prophecies

1067
00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:40,749
opposition

1068
00:47:40,749 --> 00:47:42,129
to each other

1069
00:47:42,129 --> 00:47:43,350
to generate data

1070
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,010
that allows us to

1071
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:47,719
harder to estimate the strength

1072
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:51,249
both abuse of the both of these kinds of
prophecy

1073
00:47:51,249 --> 00:47:51,989
because

1074
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:58,119
the young

1075
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:00,329
processing they're able to

1076
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:02,669
include more

1077
00:48:02,669 --> 00:48:03,130
exclude

1078
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,219
more of the targets

1079
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:08,009
but the than the old or

1080
00:48:08,009 --> 00:48:10,090
the old are getting a lot of their

1081
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:15,059
or items in the inclusion efficient by
virtue of something like automatic

1082
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,790
and it's that same automatic priming

1083
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:21,680
coupled with a problem in conscious
recollection recollection

1084
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,299
that uh... route

1085
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:25,009
that the whole leads them to perform

1086
00:48:25,009 --> 00:48:30,269
less well all on the arm

1087
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:31,759
we've got a method here

1088
00:48:31,759 --> 00:48:33,899
that allows us for the first time

1089
00:48:33,899 --> 00:48:36,799
to actually measure

1090
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:37,509
conscious

1091
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:38,849
past performance

1092
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,380
and measure

1093
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,829
unconscious test performance

1094
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:42,759
and see

1095
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:46,240
how they compare to each other that's
the important point

1096
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,159
of this method of opposition

1097
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,300
and this method now becomes used

1098
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:56,680
in the whole raft of cognitive
psychology experiments involving memory

1099
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,859
perception language and so on

1100
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:01,149
all of which are intended

1101
00:49:01,149 --> 00:49:01,899
uh...

1102
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:05,279
to uh...

1103
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:08,619
the degree to which any particular
broadcast

1104
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:14,089
is performed consciously in a controlled
manner that consumers attentive of the

1105
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:15,949
pension or resources

1106
00:49:15,949 --> 00:49:17,180
one consciously

1107
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,830
in an automatic matter

1108
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,609
that doesn't

1109
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:23,009
attentional resource

1110
00:49:23,009 --> 00:49:25,659
in cognitive psychology

1111
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:32,430
the general of the general idea has been
as jacoby ordered suggested

1112
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:36,420
most tasks are performed by a kind of
mixed of conscious

1113
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,269
and on conscious

1114
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:38,589
controlled

1115
00:49:38,589 --> 00:49:40,969
and automatic prostitute

1116
00:49:40,969 --> 00:49:44,259
but when the concept of a lot of mca
city

1117
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:47,150
alm of was doda taken up by

1118
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,789
social psychology

1119
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:53,879
a growing number of social psychologist
argued that in fact

1120
00:49:53,879 --> 00:49:57,029
controlled conscious processing

1121
00:49:57,029 --> 00:49:58,119
relatively little

1122
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:00,969
role a relatively small role

1123
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:04,339
what we do in the ordinary course of
everyday living

1124
00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:05,679
that in fact

1125
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:06,819
most of what we do

1126
00:50:06,819 --> 00:50:08,979
we do want to matically

1127
00:50:08,979 --> 00:50:11,079
we do unconsciously

1128
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:15,019
we do on automatic pilot

1129
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:16,360
thinking about anything

1130
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,509
at all

1131
00:50:17,509 --> 00:50:21,529
this is all about the tendency in social
psychology that i've come to call the or

1132
00:50:21,529 --> 00:50:23,729
commit to city juggernaut

1133
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,859
called because it's like that vehicle in
hindu mythology that kind of

1134
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,160
carries the goddard

1135
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,479
rules over everything in its path

1136
00:50:31,479 --> 00:50:32,199
home

1137
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:35,909
you have to part of the next time when
we meet

1138
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:37,089
all describe

1139
00:50:37,089 --> 00:50:41,380
how this concept of autumn it has to be
became important from cognitive

1140
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,410
psychology into awk in into social
psychology

1141
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:46,920
in a matter that suggested

1142
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,319
we're all on automatic pilot

1143
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,069
all the time

1144
00:50:51,069 --> 00:50:52,989
that are conscious

1145
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:53,660
intentions

1146
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,369
are conscious police

1147
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:59,479
or conscious attitudes have little or
nothing to do

1148
00:50:59,479 --> 00:51:02,670
what we do in the ordinary course of
everyday living

1149
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,679
if basically overspend on tap a
phenomenal ism

1150
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:08,709
that says were conscious automata

1151
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:11,819
we happen to be conscious

1152
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:15,819
consciousness plays essentially no rule
in our behavior

1153
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:17,519
put it on their way

1154
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,419
we are orderly lacking unconscious

1155
00:51:20,419 --> 00:51:24,369
freedom of the will

1156
00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:25,929
but before we do that

1157
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:29,109
we have to celebrate presidents day

1158
00:51:29,109 --> 00:51:31,869
so remember there's no class on monday

1159
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:35,289
we'll be back here on wednesday and i'll
take you through

1160
00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:37,109
studies of out of necessity in social
behavior
