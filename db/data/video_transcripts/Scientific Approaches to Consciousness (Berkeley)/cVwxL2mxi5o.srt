1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,699
okay let's finish up our discussion of
mind-body relations

2
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,559
in fact will continue in the next series
of lectures as well

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,219
just to

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,670
put the finishing touches on the
discussion last week

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,369
alm

6
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:20,490
it strikes me that

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,419
psychosomatic interactions of various
kinds where people's expectations and

8
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:27,240
believes that influence the function of
the body

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,270
are one way to approach the question of
whether the mind influences the body

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,950
and the point here is just to make clear
that

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,739
if we're going to

12
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:38,529
if we're going to talk about
psychosomatic interactions we have to

13
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:41,010
make distinctions among three

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,570
quite different kinds of all
relationships

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,550
the first of these

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,850
the affects of expectations and beliefs
on one's mental state

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,730
and a good example of this is the
placebo response in pain

18
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:01,490
pains a mental state expect bob placebos
involved expectations so if a policy

19
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,210
more reduces

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,480
pain reduces the experience of pain

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,860
that doesn't really count as a
psychosomatic attacked because

22
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,740
we haven't actually measured anything in
the body good called a psycho psycho

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,320
effect if you want

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,930
and similarly if we see have been we are
dwindling solve placebo or suggestion or

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,070
something like that

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,610
on psalm aspect of central nervous
system functioning

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,439
that's also belittle problematic as
evidence of psychosomatic while affects

28
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,159
because

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,130
if we believe as most of us do

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,799
that what goes on to the line goes on in
the brain

31
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,939
you could just have the central nervous
system affect

32
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:44,399
being a arm there being some kind of
represen

33
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,360
or biological substrates

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,010
bubble psycho psycho a fact

35
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,200
where you really want to see
psychosomatic affects where you really

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,890
want to see evidence

37
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,590
expectations beliefs and suggestions on
bottling process these

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,350
is when you look at this and physical
properties outside

39
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,140
the central nervous system

40
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,459
liken the skeletal system where the
cardiovascular system or something on

41
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,559
something like that

42
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:12,939
and last time i tried to show you a
couple of examples on the kind of thing

43
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,260
that we're talking about

44
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,559
and there's more of a civil lecture
supplement that i just don't have time

45
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:19,599
the discussion

46
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,680
all simply close that part of a lecture
by saying that

47
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,589
we now have two new scientific
disciplines

48
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:30,749
psycho and oh chronology and psycho
immunology

49
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:33,709
sometimes fought over psycho neuro
endocrinology

50
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,219
and psycho bureau immunology 'cause we
got to have no role in everything these

51
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:38,579
days

52
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:41,629
but the whole point here it is that
these are

53
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,079
although

54
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,950
recognize fields all aqua biology and
medicine

55
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,160
that are predicated on the idea

56
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,649
that psychological processes can have an
effect on endocrine function

57
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:58,809
and the psychological processes could
have an effect on immune function

58
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:03,959
the the existence of these subfields of
biology and medicine onto the sensor or

59
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,499
attribute to beyond

60
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:10,349
to the persistent interest in the home

61
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,139
in psychosomatic in elections

62
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:14,449
let's turn to

63
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:15,660
the next problem

64
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,230
which has a problem of whether there is
a nobody could have minds with our

65
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,759
bodies

66
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:26,279
mode bill question posed that way we
found a little strange

67
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:28,999
but in fact is the long history

68
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:33,189
ald paul did not know them discussions
even among still a big even within the

69
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:34,669
scientific community

70
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:37,150
of people who are both of the
possibility

71
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,249
that somehow

72
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:40,889
minds are independent

73
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:43,299
all volvo brings

74
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:46,729
and if you think about it for a second
you can see that the roots of this

75
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:49,309
go back at least as far as descartes

76
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:53,659
on diff not to religious doctrines of
both the soul

77
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:55,150
if big car was right

78
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,120
that mind and body or composed of two
different substances that in the

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,280
interact somehow

80
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,030
bennett ought to be the case

81
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,439
that mind somehow exists

82
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,450
only independent home

83
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,739
bodies

84
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,229
this question which is implied by
descartes archive god i came to light

85
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,320
headed in the late nineteenth century

86
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,850
with the rise in europe and america all
day movements known as spiritualism

87
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,050
which as it suggests that was study of
spirits

88
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,519
or though that or the spirit world

89
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,319
all the all

90
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:31,219
origins of this is unworkable or both of
you know

91
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:34,759
well the gun and a bad you whilst we
were questioned filed today

92
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,110
religious

93
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,470
ought to go over to san francisco

94
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,910
you'll see a sweden gorjan churches for
the finest examples of craftsman

95
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,010
architecture west of the mississippi

96
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,340
all that

97
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,069
and on but what what uh... what
spiritualism was all about what was it

98
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:52,380
that would be group of people who
believe

99
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,420
that dog but there were creatures beams

100
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,460
all spirits

101
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,780
which all of the word which functioned
as as they called them

102
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,760
this in cardiff he wins

103
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,910
that is

104
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,009
conquered creatures which were
affectively mines without bodies

105
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:11,099
and died in the united states there was
a a a a lot of our group interested

106
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,319
related argument in spiritualism

107
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,460
by these three women voted for fox
sisters

108
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,719
margaret

109
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,050
and we up

110
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,100
who are what around the made themselves
quite famous

111
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,110
all bubye all of the bod bike uh...
uh... present themselves as being able

112
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,839
to communicate with the dead

113
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:32,099
all one of their own goaded communica
tions

114
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,650
was a guide name mr split foot

115
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,999
which if you

116
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:39,490
with the word a little bit and see
that's supposed to be some kind of all

117
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,909
proxy for the devil

118
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:43,349
all but they spent on ralph a lot of
their time

119
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:46,279
art deco corresponding with a young

120
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,110
but the spirit named charles b roost mup

121
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,960
all who all they did they are

122
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,099
or you'd had died in the basement of
their host

123
00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:00,470
and chuckle that they had actually had
lucrative careers as as well as mediums

124
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,010
they would go around doing sean's
seances and uh... and and other uh...

125
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,809
kinds performances

126
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:08,880
communicating with charles p_ rourk
smook

127
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,520
and abroad through charles b rosemont

128
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,699
helping all people to communicate with
their deceased relatives and other all

129
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,629
and on their loved ones and they were
very very very famous

130
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,449
all around the time of the you know

131
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:22,020
when the time the civil war

132
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,329
and in the home

133
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:25,559
the reconstruction period

134
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:30,179
arm so did was with the fox sisters that
we began a whole tradition

135
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:34,649
alba although among the medium ship or
clairvoyance people holding steady on

136
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:35,520
thursday

137
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,520
communicating with the dead by means of
a ouija ouija boards are automatic

138
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,419
writing

139
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,459
on the fox sisters themselves were very
although they're very good at table

140
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:45,099
wrapping

141
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:48,710
or where they would sit around a table
and everybody would hold hands and

142
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,259
all spirits would knock out messages in
something like morse code

143
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:53,810
on

144
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,530
wasn't worse code word was something
like that

145
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,329
hauled off on the other on the table

146
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:03,960
on thing that's so popular that in
england and in the united states

147
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,679
all grupo bald them people called funded
through society for cycle research

148
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,260
uh... to investigate these kinds of
things

149
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,200
these were not simply crackpots william
james was a founding member of the

150
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,669
society per cycle

151
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,180
all research

152
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,159
all

153
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:23,829
and lead to a gall bladder an actual
commission the saber commission

154
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:28,089
which investigated the fox sisters and
large numbers of other people

155
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:32,879
home who were presenting themselves as
mediums and who came to the conclusion

156
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:33,419
that

157
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,010
there had to be some kind of

158
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,079
fraud here but it was unclear exactly
off of the hull people we're doing it

159
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:44,319
our year after the cyber commission pole
vault of the made its report all

160
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,319
margaret

161
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,590
the along with it

162
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,520
over the world one of the park sisters
actually confessed to how they have done

163
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,139
it

164
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,639
the flock sisters had discovered

165
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,360
how they could

166
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,759
some of you never bought a lot of people
have the have a crack in your knuckles

167
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,810
although they have all of that they
developed a way of cracking buried me

168
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,680
use

169
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,690
without

170
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,900
actually touching them just by kind of
manipulating their legs

171
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,150
and so they were sending the what what
seemed like table wrapping it was

172
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,050
actually these three women

173
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,430
cracking their knees underneath the
table

174
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,819
all in this kind of code coming from
charles b realms book

175
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:24,470
margaret's confession destroyed the
armed the aldo leopold

176
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,879
the awb

177
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,560
economic value all vault of this whole
thing

178
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,349
so her sister's kinda get dub bonner
richie recanted in eighteen eighty nine

179
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,240
only to be here

180
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,040
called and then she looked a lot later
died and and and for full on the whole

181
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,470
thing too long

182
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,910
to her grade

183
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,750
all i had a boat margaret's confession
really pretty much put the kite basha

184
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,160
uh... on on this whole

185
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,440
nineteenth-century of the tradition of
spiritualism

186
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,560
and it died uh... until relatively
recently well when it got uh... revived

187
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,659
but again there are people here who were
quite dark on quite serious about this

188
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:02,250
william james himself towards the end of
his life

189
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,130
made arrangements with his elderly
friends

190
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,500
if they died and they remained in the
spirit and and then the bottom line

191
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,029
found themselves in the in the end of
the spirit world

192
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:17,300
but there were all of them what policy
goals baked that though i think your

193
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,430
rate with them to send back to him

194
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,000
so he'd know that they exist yet she
tried to do something slight

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,930
difficulties

196
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,690
odd james never heard a thing

197
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,200
palm

198
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,629
hoover but that's not the point the
point is that james that work

199
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:33,139
you know might be true

200
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,040
here's how we do experiments often this
right

201
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,970
all talk to all my dying friends

202
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,460
and ask them to send messages back

203
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,180
anyway nothing much came of that until
all below the

204
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,210
on the until more recently as we'll see

205
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,430
all bob white and protects what what
took the place of spiritualism

206
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,530
nineteenth-century spiritualism

207
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,670
wasn't interest among twentieth-century
psychologists in what probably know

208
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,850
called parapsychology

209
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,170
or the story of sod so-called saudi
phenomenal

210
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,109
which is defined that's the official
definition

211
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:11,119
on novelist prostheses of information or
energy transfer

212
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:13,350
that are currently export unexplained

213
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,950
in terms of known physical or biological
mechanisms

214
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,890
now if you read this literature which i
had to do ones

215
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,440
so that's one inflicting this on you

216
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,200
on there are two versions

217
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,650
all vault dot gov parapsychology

218
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,550
there's a soft version which says

219
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,960
there's so there are some processes of
information of energy transfer that are

220
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,440
currently on explained in terms of known
physical or biological mechanisms but

221
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,440
that just means that there are some
physical or biological mechanisms that

222
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,560
we don't know about yet

223
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,870
so the soft version of parapsychology
basically says

224
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,020
all there were some other sensory
modalities that we've got that we

225
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,900
haven't discovered in addition to a
vision and auditioned and custody

226
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,700
channel faction

227
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,950
all and all the rest

228
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,840
the harm version of parapsychology is
what we're really interested in in the

229
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,480
context of this course

230
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,959
because what the hard version of
parapsychology says is that

231
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:12,210
there are processes of the information
or energy transfer that do not involved

232
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,750
physical or biological mechanisms

233
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,490
and what that means is

234
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,390
minds

235
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,970
communicating with mines

236
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,930
without any physical medium

237
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,879
on at all

238
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,540
no sensation the language no nothing

239
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,030
just direct contact

240
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,770
and what that implies again

241
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,930
is that you can have mine without a body
you can have mine without

242
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,010
all without any kind of physical

243
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,260
what kinds of anomalous processing is
are we talking about

244
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,380
here's a list from charles part

245
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,680
or whose owners of the prominent
psychologist who's involved in this

246
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,510
literature

247
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,170
all basically come in altman these
phenomena come in three different

248
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,220
categories

249
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,210
alm most all of the mostly older or
probly all prophecies of extra sensory

250
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:54,960
perception

251
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,500
all telepathy the communication of the
contents of one mind to another

252
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,990
all without danielle dot without any
physical

253
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,490
all of them physical medium

254
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,340
clairvoyance is related to pull out the
fields also known as remote viewing

255
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:13,970
it and all the dan clairvoyance you've
seen what somebody else's c

256
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,100
okay so

257
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,940
i'm sitting here now and berkeley and i
and see what

258
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,870
mikhail gorbachev is seen in this
officer

259
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,170
dolphin moscow or something like that
that's remote viewing

260
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,540
all pre cognition

261
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,329
all has to do with all of the the
cognition baba bands that have not yet

262
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:32,590
occurred

263
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,940
because you can come to see the future

264
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,910
all band members post cognition

265
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,980
because that will geez pulls cognition
that's for investors memory

266
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,990
but noel post cognition is

267
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,220
experience in the past in the present

268
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,680
so i could sit here and i'm also a
veteran napoleon's army going abroad

269
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,129
that the attack in moscow or something
like that

270
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:56,160
and i'm seeing it as it happens right
now

271
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,019
all of that

272
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:58,709
or all of these phenomena

273
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:03,500
seem to involve the transmission of one
person's mental state onto another

274
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,310
now we have psycho cases

275
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,480
are moving objects simply by virtue of
the operation of the mind

276
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,170
and then all the tarred adds a third
category here goes our traditional

277
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,600
plus life phenomenon

278
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,280
tarred edsel any other third category
called medical spiritual healing

279
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,330
sometimes called energy medicine

280
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:28,190
where all part of the people he'll
diseases all basically by

281
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,090
the operations of ball although
coppermine

282
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,770
all right so those are but most of the
basic talked of the kinds of phenomena

283
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,019
that you have to

284
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,250
that we have to deal with

285
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,760
so the question is

286
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,440
how can you possibly make a science of
this

287
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,430
well famously j_b_ ryan a psychologist
who for it was first at harbor boulevard

288
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,110
person or burden of that uh... duke
university

289
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,710
all actually got interested this problem
we have got nineteen twenties and

290
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,010
nineteen thirties

291
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,359
and uh... developed aguilarg
experimental paradigm for the study of

292
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,860
or at least extra sensory perception

293
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,800
that has basically persisted odd to this
day

294
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,310
uh... he will not heal research
associated his name is either

295
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,140
invented

296
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,790
that water nao known as zener cards

297
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,930
these five cards with these kind of
quite distinct or the symbols on them

298
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,110
and you can see in this picture from
ryan's laboratory that's running

299
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,150
and that's his wife luisa

300
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:28,810
hall they work together in this is some
do sophomore

301
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,480
so all the there's a sender

302
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,670
who sees one of these cards

303
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,510
and there's a reason for

304
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,340
groups uses all morning

305
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,200
these steps

306
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,970
which one

307
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:45,350
the sender is seen under parsers this
barrier here that prevents communication

308
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,750
and uh... that and and and stuff like
that

309
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,270
there's a spoof of almost everything and
ghostbusters

310
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,810
odd yeah ghostbusters his

311
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,150
ghostbusters kind of our pub parody of
spiritualism

312
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,190
uh... but those guys just kind of

313
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,150
threw everything into the admitted into
the bathtub and seen that movie for a

314
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,850
long time

315
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,790
but uh...

316
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,560
i'm i'm sure there is

317
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,710
but you don't have to go to ghostbusters
to get the spook you can actually go to

318
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:19,950
solve department of psychology

319
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:25,050
so anyway tom what what what ryan nam
what what what ryan deborah these

320
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:30,170
experiments ok der the rye new what he
was doing was trained as a biologist

321
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,150
first as actually trained as a botanist

322
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,500
but they need retooled himself as a
psychology who don't know how to do

323
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,710
control sick

324
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,459
understood that you had to separate the
sender in the receiver in

325
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:42,440
and all that kind of business

326
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,750
all bandow he claimed on in his uh...

327
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,520
all that water rafting printers reminded
he had evidence for all

328
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,180
for home

329
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,010
the yard

330
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,810
what's on the mind of the sender

331
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,199
could go into the mind of the receiver

332
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,510
even though there was no what
opportunity for any kind of physical

333
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:06,860
uh... physical connection between them

334
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,150
all of these kinds of claims have lost
have long been problematic the national

335
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,670
research council all voting for the some
years ago i sat on this committee

336
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,000
all road reviewed all of the parable of
the parapsychology for the all of them

337
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,240
for the united states military which was
interested in this

338
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,970
poem

339
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,050
actually got you know what you are
interested in it

340
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,629
they were interested in the

341
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:30,360
nineteen eighty eight

342
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,110
they were interested in it because the
soviet union

343
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,680
had a big risk that the soviet military
had a big operation studying

344
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,740
parapsychology

345
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,340
and we figured

346
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,310
if there are starting at we gotta figure
this out to

347
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,100
so it wasn't just a missile gap between
the soviets and the united states unit

348
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,030
there was also a young mental

349
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,460
on so that some kind of some kind of
parapsychology gap

350
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,930
and the army commission the national
research council to word that the study

351
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,790
does

352
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,469
and the national research council quite
recently said

353
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:02,839
there's nothing there

354
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:03,660
okay

355
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,630
although a lot of all a lot of what
color claims to be plausible para

356
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,880
psychotic but it's for parapsychology is
just kind of outright

357
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,710
fraud

358
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,370
although there's a lot of expert better
by a slot of subtle subtle metal

359
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,290
methodological problems although it here

360
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:23,100
all a lot of capitalization on chance
that's the list of of issues but what

361
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,880
really bothers people most of all
parapsychology is not just that there's

362
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,750
no evidence for it

363
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,960
the whole idea of as did the from this
is a quote from the a_p_a_ dictionary of

364
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,279
psychology

365
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,490
admitted even one instance of paranormal
causation would overthrow virtually all

366
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,289
the established wars and principles of
science

367
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:43,919
sold you can see what's home

368
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,820
what's at stake

369
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,620
in response to these kinds of critiques

370
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,200
lot of people just kind of gave up

371
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,380
like i said yeah that's right

372
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,080
but other people have persisted

373
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,880
all and in particular aud trolls order
to and who was all leading figure in the

374
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,570
american society for technical research

375
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,350
all of the continued to

376
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,980
to perform studies all volun

377
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,180
twelve off

378
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,670
dubbo telepathy

379
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,700
on his email modify uh... basically
modification of rice procedure

380
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,260
which he calls the guns filled procedure

381
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,710
horner chen argued for being called the
noise reduction model

382
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,250
pole vault of all uh... slight
phenomenal

383
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,720
which basically says that whatever he
asked me is picking up

384
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,090
is a very weak signal that's why the
experimental results were so one

385
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,860
reliable and looked at me affects common
go

386
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,070
on so what what do you do if you want to
pick up a weak signal what you've got to

387
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,030
do is to get rid of all the noise so
that the signal comes out so we

388
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,100
developed what's known as the guns
filled procedure

389
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,530
paul dot hole

390
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,309
procedure

391
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:54,110
all of them to would kind of nasty
internal and external noise this is a

392
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,930
photograph of below what what happens
here

393
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,609
that the there's asunder

394
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:02,859
just like in the rhine experiments will
concentrates on an image not as either a

395
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:05,790
card anymore but in actual image

396
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,929
all up and the receiver has to choose
among of four test items for all part of

397
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:12,720
on or multiple choice

398
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,940
so there's a twenty five twelve percent
punch olympic rate

399
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,410
but while the receiver causes recvd
knees signals okay

400
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,980
while he or she does so in a restricted
sensory environment during a really nice

401
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,150
reclining chair that best or cologne
germany combined

402
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,650
these are actually ping-pong balls that
have been cut in half

403
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,420
bold and put over the audience so that
you don't get any visual stimulation

404
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,670
light comes through but the uh... but no
imagery

405
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,860
and you're wearing headphones that are
paldon sending white noise into your

406
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,230
room

407
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,900
into your rodney peers

408
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,730
to block out any kind of auditory on

409
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,610
distraction on as well

410
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,860
using this ganas filled all the
procedure

411
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,140
all hundred-ton paul and his colleagues
produced all the set of thirty nine

412
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,460
studies over a period of ball about ten
fifteen years

413
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,830
all all of which had the same quality

414
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,919
the sender focuses on a picture

415
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:11,460
the receiver picard and tries to guess
which old four alternatives the sender

416
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,970
is looking at

417
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,740
on dad what he found was

418
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,269
people could do this at

419
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:19,559
but doubt that breaks that are much
better calmed down now

420
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,900
than chance

421
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,580
alba dot at the

422
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,139
you don't agree about where that what
lee ellen's of publius patristic is

423
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:26,220
derived

424
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,150
but all the results that insane
psychology other aspects of social

425
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:31,650
science

426
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,880
we usually look at

427
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,770
all we would like to look at the size of
an experimental affect essentially the

428
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,030
difference between experimental and
control groups

429
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,260
and all he got across the thirty nine
studies as i mean effect size appointed

430
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,960
to the seven which is

431
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,860
statistically significant

432
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,910
bigger than you'd expect by chance

433
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,429
and jacob cohen a dead while you are
embraced dog

434
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:57,890
thought that uh... bob proposed a set of
some of the standards here

435
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,830
offer the evaluating these things if you
if you read met analyses in the uh...

436
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,690
from literature reviews and
psychological journals

437
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,320
you always see

438
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,470
of the reference to cohen standards

439
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,029
automate effect size of all

440
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:15,450
if we point to three is right in the
middle of the range that colin described

441
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,790
as a small effect

442
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,880
well any of the fact

443
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,270
right with what it would be uh... would
be interesting

444
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,400
almost social science effects are in

445
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,620
the small to medium

446
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,450
range

447
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,050
of the devil you get the facts eyes like
that

448
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,660
mostly by killing someone

449
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,049
uh... so that we kind of have to be
satisfied

450
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:37,950
uh... whitbread with these kinds of
things

451
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,929
so that's the old although that's the
old all that

452
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:45,499
so-called all gone still database so
name because there's a new guns fell

453
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:46,620
database

454
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,500
all subsequent we are at the heart and i
had a cornell psychologist beryl bhavan

455
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,960
that's dural bam right there

456
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,120
all-volunteer or the developer refined
into the gods filled procedure

457
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,790
dogged basically used a computer to
select

458
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,220
the home

459
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,669
the you know that the stimulus materials
just kind of get one more thing ha

460
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:09,470
uh... what what more opportunity

461
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,330
for all

462
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,120
for some kind of bias to enter

463
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,130
the enter into the situation out of the
picture

464
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,950
and in nineteen ninety four

465
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,260
on them in heart and reported a set of
eleven studies

466
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,360
if you look at just look at the present
if it's again

467
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,600
twenty-five print you'd expect twenty
five percent by chance across beyond

468
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,419
that the uh... across the studies

469
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:33,799
they achieved a thirty two percent

470
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,560
arbitrate which is against physically

471
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,720
uh... significant

472
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,100
on and the kind of thing that would give
evidence for

473
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,200
for rome

474
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,650
uh... telepathy

475
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,480
usual standards of

476
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,290
of psychological inference

477
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:51,909
fallen

478
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:57,600
ray hyman who's a psychologist at of the
university of washington now retired

479
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,850
longtime critic called para
psychological research

480
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,009
palm and uh... on he had actually worked

481
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:08,250
pizza these are interesting guy is a
quick but he says look i'm open

482
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,100
but if you're going to convince me i got
to do certain kinds of things

483
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,099
any i could have actually worked with
charles daughter kim

484
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:19,240
to develop guidelines for the proper
conduct of para psychological research

485
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,040
on that part of the basically enforce
all of them through this day

486
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,330
all blocked off of the all highland long
look at these things in symbolic burst

487
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,000
birthday you know

488
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,570
dabur aside from outright experimenter
fraud and

489
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,740
nobody thinks

490
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,860
that either darryl bam or charles
hundred-ton were deliberate gauged

491
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,960
outright fraud something

492
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,880
there are some

493
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,980
there is a lot of the serious problems
with these kinds of experiments

494
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,820
mostly

495
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,030
all because of some failures to
adequately randomized the stimuli

496
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,910
and also because of there was a lot of
opportunity

497
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,230
for all of the experimenter to prompt
subjects to respond

498
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,390
and therefore might contaminate uh...
their own their response

499
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,580
walked off of what high-minded in israel
ballusters

500
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:08,639
was to identify those experiments where
there were serious methodological

501
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:09,640
problems

502
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,240
and those experiments where their work

503
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,680
few or no i'm not of these were all
about the lobbies methodological

504
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,220
problems

505
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,660
and look at the hit rates in those two
categories of experiments

506
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,110
and it turns out in the problematic
experiments

507
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,360
you get hit rate of about

508
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,059
forty seven percent compared to what
baseline by chance of twenty five

509
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,240
percent

510
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,200
for those experiments that involved the
least problematic experimental

511
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,720
conditions that is the methodological e
titus

512
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,559
of orbited ordered experiments

513
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,170
you've got a hit rate that was actually
below chance

514
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:40,830
halt vote

515
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,639
point one eight

516
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:42,990
you put it all together

517
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,450
on his best estimate

518
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,460
of the hit rate in these experiments

519
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,990
was not home

520
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,710
tell the world war that was not thirty
two percent but something closer to

521
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,559
twenty seven twenty eight percent which
isn't

522
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,710
significantly different

523
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,460
problem

524
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,770
so again what see what what you're
seeing here is

525
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,150
but got the same problems over and over
and over again

526
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,309
now that's not at all

527
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:08,440
for people

528
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,130
all people kept doing these studies

529
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,030
all because they are fine and it's a
challenge

530
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,510
on joyce milner colleague at all but all
of the reviewed thirty new studies

531
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,850
thirty studies

532
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,739
don between nineteen eighty seven and
nineteen ninety four

533
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:25,550
just shows a how popular offices

534
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,799
all all of which

535
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,570
they presume to follow the uh... hyman
harder to guidelines because everybody

536
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,770
was doing that at the time

537
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,120
and when you look at those thirty new
studies

538
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,250
which are as methodological e good as
you can get

539
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,890
the overall effect size was point no one

540
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:45,010
as close to zero as you can

541
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,560
that wasn't enough

542
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,399
all stormin' airtel to european
investigators

543
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:54,629
examined the complete database of
seventy-nine gone spelled alguns film

544
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:55,320
studies

545
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,610
and got above the table overall effect
size roughly point pa warno

546
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,919
roughly point one four

547
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,980
which is significant statistically
significant

548
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,620
our in-store minner tells that

549
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,200
seemed there really is an affect here
you can't make this effect go away

550
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,450
what's tormentor tell didn't notice

551
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,410
if cardiac defects lies in the thirty
nine studies in the all the guns fell

552
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:25,440
database before the hyman hundred-ton
guidelines have been announced

553
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,540
not trivial

554
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,510
but if you look at the forty studies and
a new bonds fell database all of which

555
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:36,410
have been conducted after the hitman
hart and guidelines have been problem

556
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,720
gated

557
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,410
they got in effect size which was about
as close to zero all as though

558
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,740
killed as you can get

559
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,350
here is the overall trend

560
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,920
the year in which the study was produced

561
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,600
the magnitude of the affect

562
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,249
it's going straight down

563
00:26:53,249 --> 00:26:55,490
to zero

564
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,640
also these early studies were quite
interesting they often are blueblood

565
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,130
produce the significant effects but the
war

566
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:03,740
gathered

567
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,500
for more

568
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,150
the affect

569
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:11,720
disappeared and that is pretty much a
story uh...

570
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,909
it's these all the guns filled studies
i'd the peace plan so much time of his

571
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:20,120
gun spilled studies of clairvoyance
precisely because this is where most of

572
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,000
the experimentation is

573
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,980
on this problem of whether you can have
a mind without a body

574
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,320
and uh...

575
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,149
this is where the actually where the the
standard surpassed

576
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:36,310
all and the land and uh... that and the
researchers are more careful

577
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,769
the bottom line is

578
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:40,320
there's no there there

579
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,590
on there just isn't on that there just
isn't any kind of detectable

580
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,770
any kind of detectable that

581
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,980
okay just all need to arm

582
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:57,580
of put the finishing touches on mind
without body we have seen the dalelro

583
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,470
relatively recently

584
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,520
a resurgence of interest in spiritualism
a revival of nineteenth-century

585
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,770
spiritualism

586
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:09,470
and the a_a_r_p_ they've been a movement
which gary schwartz psychologist at

587
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,890
university of arizona

588
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,550
calls the survival of consciousness and
by what by that he means

589
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,590
the survival of consciousness after
death

590
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:22,090
there's always been a lot of attic total
evidence for so-called survival of

591
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,140
consciousness

592
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,600
our people and often talked about of the
people who have had all life threatening

593
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,500
experiences

594
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,890
all often report had been out-of-body
experiences

595
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,060
where at their with it's it appears as
if they're mines have left their bodies

596
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,320
you can also get this

597
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,850
if u

598
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,860
ingest certain psychoactive drugs but
don't try this out

599
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:48,010
park and you can also get reports about
a body experiences uncertain

600
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,880
pathological conditions uh...

601
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,399
of the uh... dissociate disorders of d
realization and be personalization

602
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:59,650
again people who have all uh... laredo

603
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,890
confronted some kind of life threatening
challenge

604
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:06,140
have often reported called water nova's
near-death experiences

605
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,720
where first it appears as if their minds
have left their bodies and then they

606
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,190
experience themselves as passing through
what total let go ahead and towards the

607
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,169
light

608
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:17,720
all the company by a kind of life

609
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,190
are all of them life review

610
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,110
homebrew

611
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,530
remove the

612
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,559
has suggested

613
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:26,900
that what you're seeing here in these
new near-death experiences now how do we

614
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,809
know about this

615
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,460
well these people did die

616
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,110
game becomes

617
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,100
near today

618
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,420
maneuver group what revive somehow

619
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,779
raymond moody is suggested that what
what what uh... what dogle

620
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:39,330
with these people referring to

621
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,620
is there a mines leaving their bodies

622
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,430
and then

623
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,250
when they don't die

624
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,620
animal somehow the body snatchers them
right back

625
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,200
or something like that

626
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,010
now again there are some there's some
people take this kind of thing uh...

627
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,600
none of them seriously

628
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,020
all in labs at the famous british
medical journal all upon wobble in his

629
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,240
colleagues all report of a prospective
study of nerd near-death experiences

630
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,150
frittered forty-four patients who were
clinically dead following kartik cardiac

631
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,060
arrest

632
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,970
clinically dead mean they had no
electrical electrical activity in the

633
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,960
brain stem

634
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,320
okay but then they were resuscitated

635
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,130
all and they came back

636
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:20,240
and all of them for normal in his
colleagues actually involve the

637
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,529
interview these people

638
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,440
and reported in the lancet

639
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,690
that poem eighteen percent of them
experienced some kind of near-death

640
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,220
experience

641
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,300
there could be lots of things going on
in the near death experience your body's

642
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,830
going to a lot of physiological changes
you don't have any brainstem electrical

643
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,180
activity that's gotta have some kind of
consequence

644
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,159
all but uh...

645
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:46,000
i think it did it's not an offer the
filed for all of them for these local cs

646
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,989
two

647
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:49,880
to entertain a_d_r_ physical explanation

648
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,980
for something like that near-death
experience for the out-of-body

649
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,650
experience

650
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,420
although the for them this code this
comes as evidence of all those

651
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:02,100
supporting the idea that somehow mines
could exist independently of bodies

652
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,720
and off on wall mole and others have
done cheaper car palm

653
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,700
argued for an analogy between

654
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,730
all brains and radios

655
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,820
and say look what happened brains don't
generate consciousness

656
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,660
what brains do is received consciousness
okay

657
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,030
justices outside

658
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,989
also unconsciousness is independent of
the brain receiver

659
00:31:24,989 --> 00:31:29,279
in the same way that or radio or
television signal is independent of the

660
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,599
radio or the television

661
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,280
uh... set

662
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,790
so if your brains turned on you can
receive consciousness if it's turned on

663
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,529
you can't

664
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:40,200
but the consciousness exists outside the
brain anyway

665
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,770
this is another example people taking
seriously

666
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,059
the prospect

667
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:46,750
on that we can have mine

668
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,890
without bodies

669
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,490
palm

670
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,690
one more trend if this is actually back
uh... there is a is a return to medium

671
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,660
shepherd uninterested mediums

672
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,759
gary schwartz mention him before

673
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:03,160
has actually gone tried to do of
experimental research on mediums

674
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,179
song

675
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:06,119
or he has a recruited

676
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,509
fifteen what he calls research mediums
or from around the country people who

677
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:14,980
advertise themselves in like the bay
area guardian or someplace as well

678
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,870
on as mediums

679
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,110
on and all uh... bleeds

680
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,560
i think is over fifty

681
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,920
all people now who are centers who are
people who have blood deceased loved

682
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,810
ones that they want to be in contact
with

683
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:30,270
and what the shorts has gone

684
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,460
tried to do or some experiments

685
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,960
in which poem

686
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,490
uh... in in which

687
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,710
of the mediums

688
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,539
try to contact the deceased loved ones

689
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:42,190
get messages from the deceased loved
ones

690
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:46,559
that are done presented to the sitters
to see if they recognize anything

691
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,650
meaningful envio

692
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,960
could be you know

693
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,940
in the messages

694
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,320
now schwartz is a trained experimental
psychologist

695
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,309
alm so he thought you have some sense of
how to do this

696
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:01,339
he's actually all of the not are limited
in these experiments

697
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:04,559
tried to uh... tried to will put some
controllers

698
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,680
if you've got a message from anybody

699
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,659
uh...

700
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:12,870
probably without too much trying

701
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,110
find something that's personally
relevant in it

702
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,160
so that's a problem with these
experiments

703
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:24,850
so much for its has done is to present
the setters

704
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:29,800
information at the medium got from the
troop from their own true target

705
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,620
and also unknown to the sitters

706
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,639
present them with information from

707
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:36,670
somebody else's loved one

708
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,450
okay control target

709
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,280
and watch words claims

710
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,120
is that palm

711
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,150
all applaud the of the sitters can
distinguish between messages have come

712
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,519
from the truth target and messages that
come from the polls target

713
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,090
and battles suggested schwartz of that
call that uh... that that medium ship is

714
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,590
possible that you can communicate with
the dead

715
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:00,289
and are raising you can communicate with
the dead

716
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:01,600
is because

717
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,330
minds exist independent of bodies

718
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,249
also what we are setback to the medium
here

719
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:09,120
while that's exactly what's happening

720
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,409
dot towards the and all of the twentieth
century

721
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,839
racine or revival

722
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,279
of an interesting involved you know that
you know uh... topics

723
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:20,859
there were very that that were very
impressed

724
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:21,709
albee interest

725
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:22,870
to uh...

726
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,720
that the end of the nineteenth century

727
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,279
whether it's some kind of ended century
thing

728
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:28,709
you know if i don't know

729
00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:32,739
uh... the end of the scent of the end of
any century could have profound effects

730
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,089
on people

731
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:36,879
all but in any event

732
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,889
this camp possibly be true

733
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:42,799
okay must be just because about this can
possibly be true

734
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:46,410
are given everything we know about minds
and bodies and all of that

735
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:49,249
and i dont presented it to you with
something that

736
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:54,639
that i think actually is true i have a
lot of respect for gary schwartz up

737
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,579
when he left harvard for you know like

738
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:03,219
replaced them and we were colleagues at
the university result

739
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:04,469
as just

740
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,379
exhibit disinterested sample of a guy
who's had

741
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:09,180
heroes and terrible problem

742
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:13,599
if there are mines independent of bodies
we have the technology we ought to be

743
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,769
able to be that we know how to design
these experiments

744
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:17,510
and all

745
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,410
uh... when when you designed experiments
you get this

746
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,930
police say in passing

747
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,490
these are the initial results

748
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,410
these studies

749
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,809
and as

750
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:31,599
publishes

751
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,490
this work and it uh... and and the comes
under

752
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,970
than usual kind of wall

753
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:41,959
scientific strictures for publication
and replication uniform triple criticism

754
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:46,509
it'll be interesting to see what happens
to these kinds of affects

755
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:49,109
we know what happened

756
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:51,699
clairvoyance

757
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:53,640
early bigger fax

758
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,349
has ruled the research interests are at
the end of price proceeded and the

759
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:59,870
research became more carefully
controlled

760
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,529
effects disappeared

761
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:06,409
are more early in the in the stage of
experimental mediums studies or whatever

762
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:07,359
it is

763
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,869
all but you can predict

764
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:10,760
on the basis of past history

765
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,160
that that's what's going to happen

766
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,069
uh... as well here

767
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:16,129
the point of all of this is

768
00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:21,179
the question of whether mines can exist
without bodies are perfectly legitimate

769
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:25,369
scientific question

770
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:26,489
william james

771
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:27,839
thought it was

772
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,459
as with the low budget but enough that
he would arrange with is dying

773
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:34,449
colleagues to sending signals from the
after world right

774
00:36:34,449 --> 00:36:37,029
that was his that that that was his way
of doing slides

775
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,370
this is the kind of thing

776
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,799
that can be investigated

777
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:44,329
more carefully we investigate

778
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:48,660
the closer we get to that unanswered
that is

779
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,950
but time will tell

780
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,429
about the

781
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:54,660
last point

782
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,770
all of which will do very briefly
because we're going to spend the next

783
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,929
couple of days talking about this in
some detail

784
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:02,169
talked about

785
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:04,659
how about bodies produce mines

786
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,729
whether mines could affect bodies

787
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:09,000
but you could have mines without bodies

788
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,889
now let's

789
00:37:09,889 --> 00:37:12,140
do the fourth one very briefly

790
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,449
can you have

791
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:14,730
bodies without minds

792
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,940
or put in psychological terms

793
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,420
is their behavior

794
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,669
that doesn't involve

795
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:20,479
the mind

796
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,430
at all

797
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,640
and the answer is

798
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,420
yes of course there is

799
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,599
we've known for a long time that there
are certain

800
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,519
here mate spent all of the detonate
behaviors that don't seem to involve the

801
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:33,979
mind at all

802
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:37,140
on spinal reflexes in cranial reflexes

803
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,779
paula dot that don't involve any hired
nervous system activity

804
00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:43,439
on taxis and invertebrates

805
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:46,859
don't seem to involve any higher nervous
system activity

806
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:50,789
and be in staying sir fixed action
patterns that the following two studies

807
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:52,369
like carl

808
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:54,139
alarm calls and bird

809
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:58,699
and all uh... imprinting them aladdin
geese and all that

810
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:02,060
also seem to be built in the hard water
body evolution

811
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,549
and don't seem to involve any kind of
mental life role

812
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:06,769
when you get to

813
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:09,589
more complex organisms in human beings

814
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:12,099
there has long been an argument

815
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:13,140
there are certain

816
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,120
although aspects of behavior those
represented by classical and

817
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,370
instrumental conditioning

818
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:21,709
that also don't involved

819
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:25,509
mental processes for mine to simply
isn't involved in it

820
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:29,409
and the people who made this argument
here of course

821
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:31,359
the behaviorist

822
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,530
who argued for what's known as a
stimulus response theory

823
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,190
on a boat of conditioning

824
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,479
that basically says

825
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:43,999
perception memories thoughts
expectations police none of that makes

826
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:45,839
any difference to behavior

827
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,589
all all we have our

828
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:49,880
finally responses

829
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,060
to environmental stimuli and stimuli and
responses get connected by a principle

830
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,700
of trying to get woody

831
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,930
that buchanan connect any stimulus to
any response that's what the

832
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,069
arbitrariness assumption is all about

833
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:06,030
in order to wonder stand behavior

834
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,199
you don't have to look inside

835
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:09,629
on the the organism

836
00:39:09,629 --> 00:39:12,549
you don't have to think about its
biology you don't have to think about

837
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:16,459
what's on its mind ripped expectations
are beliefs reports

838
00:39:16,459 --> 00:39:18,609
and the organism

839
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:19,979
active

840
00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:20,759
behavior

841
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:26,649
the behaviorist idea was that the
environment acts on organisms

842
00:39:26,649 --> 00:39:31,160
organisms don't do anything independent
of environmental stimuli

843
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,200
in other words

844
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,329
that people

845
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:33,829
palm

846
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,660
on just like other animals

847
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,279
reflex machines

848
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,369
you see

849
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:42,009
we don't nobody

850
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:43,519
nobody acknowledges

851
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,260
that they're behaviorist any longer

852
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,140
i don't think

853
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,330
um... kinda like finding somebody who
voted for richard nixon nobody will

854
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,469
admit it

855
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:54,229
along

856
00:39:54,229 --> 00:39:58,219
you can see this decide this question
about whether you can have a mind

857
00:39:58,219 --> 00:40:02,309
without a body what he could have bodies
without wines and wines with our bodies

858
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:03,059
alm

859
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:08,519
in what's known in the fourth optical
trade as those on the argument against

860
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:09,719
materialism

861
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:14,249
snuggle wall in history a lot of
spalazzo for estimated on gonna david

862
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:14,989
chalmers

863
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:16,709
has made it most famously

864
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:18,039
he says what

865
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,200
we let's define as dom beat

866
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,560
as a creature

867
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,880
that is physiologically identical to
human beings

868
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,059
but lack conscious experience

869
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:31,849
this is a definition of what's known as
the full lhasa for resolving

870
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:32,779
a creature

871
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:35,190
that is physiologically identical to
humans

872
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,070
but lacks conscious experience

873
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,830
and childers argument

874
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:42,009
goes as follows

875
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:44,969
the actual argument

876
00:40:44,969 --> 00:40:47,339
fall off of her

877
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:50,549
zombies are conceivable

878
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:53,979
whatever it is conceivable is possible

879
00:40:53,979 --> 00:40:58,039
and therefore zombies are possible

880
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:02,909
an exam these are possible if it's
possible to have a creature that's

881
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:06,789
physiologically identical to humans but
lacked conscious experience

882
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:07,490
therefore

883
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,859
the materialist take on mind
unconsciousness

884
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:11,910
is wrong

885
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,449
because materialism leave something out

886
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:16,349
because zombies

887
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:21,180
who are physiologically identical to
humans but my conscious experience

888
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,739
have conscious experience therefore
there's something about physical

889
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:27,279
materialism that doesn't account for
consciousness

890
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:30,769
now what chalmers and other people argue
with that

891
00:41:30,769 --> 00:41:31,919
perfectly

892
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:34,569
logical soldiers of

893
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:39,029
so long as you accept the major premise
leads on these are conceivable

894
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,559
and so long as you except the minor
premise

895
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:44,719
that whatever is conceivable as possible

896
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,069
must reach the conclusion

897
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:48,319
if you follow aristotle's rules

898
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,200
that zombies are possible

899
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,299
completely logical

900
00:41:55,299 --> 00:41:58,589
solo her case if you accept the
pregnancy is right

901
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:00,339
okay but the best of

902
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:03,989
small problem with the argument right
now

903
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:08,089
and that's the minor promise bizarre
really true that whatever is conceivable

904
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:09,269
as possible

905
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:13,739
is it conceivable that the ratio of the
diameter toward the circle to would

906
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:18,489
start the woods radius is something less
than all your whatever it izak

907
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:21,090
conceivable i suppose it's conceivable

908
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,290
all of them

909
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,410
that maybe not but people like that

910
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:27,039
a lot of difficulty with this argument

911
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:27,819
in part

912
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:28,710
because it is

913
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:33,759
a perfectly logical argument

914
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,939
people just get

915
00:42:34,939 --> 00:42:37,420
really wierd about it and doesn't

916
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:43,119
there's that's going to be something
wrong here

917
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,679
one response is that ok it's logical

918
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:47,259
okay

919
00:42:47,259 --> 00:42:50,719
but there are some problems in the first
one is with the pts with the minor

920
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:56,299
premise right the conceivable would be
does not necessarily entail possibility

921
00:42:56,299 --> 00:43:00,939
but the more though the better argument
i think against the zombie art

922
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:03,690
thugs on b contour argument it for if
you will

923
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,869
all the comes from den bennett

924
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:08,600
which is to say that if we believe

925
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,499
that the brain is the physical substrate
of the mine

926
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:16,180
then are being that is physiologically
identical to humans

927
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,459
would be conscious

928
00:43:17,459 --> 00:43:20,930
perforce despite the fact that he's
physiologically

929
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,489
identical to humans

930
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:28,059
on you can say well materialism leave
something out

931
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:29,559
alm without dealing with

932
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:33,249
this problem if it hits the brains of
physical substrate of mine

933
00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:36,010
that'd be that's physiologically
identical to humans

934
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:40,899
would have to be conscious you can't
have those kinds of something

935
00:43:40,899 --> 00:43:45,519
my view of this is that the philosopher
zombie is the wrong argument to me

936
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:48,919
okay if you want to talk about this if
you want about the relationship between

937
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:49,830
body and mind

938
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,219
which you really want to do was

939
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:55,379
is the forget about philosopher is on
the

940
00:43:55,379 --> 00:43:58,900
physiologically identical to humans but
lacking conscious experience

941
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,089
all ballad and then it at some point
talks about the simos

942
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:05,599
on as wonderful way of words and says

943
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,429
all winter but would would you might
have a zimbalist which is a zombie that

944
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:13,689
believes it's conscious

945
00:44:13,689 --> 00:44:17,049
really conscious the implication
actually

946
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:19,569
debiting sw resembles

947
00:44:19,569 --> 00:44:22,979
okay death really does think resembles

948
00:44:22,979 --> 00:44:26,989
on new things that we just think we're
conscious

949
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:27,490
home

950
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:31,540
he's a darn he's one of those knew billy
j_c_s_ for example has got a whole

951
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,510
argument about religious belief is that
you don't believe in god you just think

952
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:39,919
you did

953
00:44:39,919 --> 00:44:41,309
at the same kind of thing

954
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:45,380
anyway i think myself that we ought to
set aside the philosopher zombie

955
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,759
and instead take our scientific
inspiration

956
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:50,079
hollywood zombies

957
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,339
the kinds of people who are portrayed in
george romero is a night of the living

958
00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:55,709
dead

959
00:44:55,709 --> 00:44:56,519
palm

960
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:59,630
because so much more interesting zombies

961
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:03,039
they're really interesting zombie just
if you've never watch the row meryl

962
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,939
movies you should watch them and you
should watch them in order

963
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:10,090
because in the night of the living dead

964
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:12,580
ans oddly is just a creature

965
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,930
that has behavioral capacities

966
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:18,529
but lacks consciousness

967
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:19,609
okay

968
00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:24,289
none of this physiologically identical
stuff zombies are defined in the movies

969
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:27,969
as creatures that my consciousness they
don't have free will decide to walk

970
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:29,659
around like that rate

971
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:34,589
they just walk around whatever they want
to do something to eat it

972
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:37,329
on and then when they're finished
feeding that they walk around until they

973
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:41,589
run into something else and then they
eat that that's all they do

974
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:45,329
out in the row meryl movies in fact
zombies evolve

975
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:48,199
which is really an interesting thing
deepened the that's why you have to

976
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:50,059
watch them in order

977
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:50,789
home

978
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:55,500
uh... until you can actually see of
romero zombies involve yuval

979
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,710
but underlying the hollywood zombie

980
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,279
is the so-called haitians on the polled
the uh... kind of

981
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:05,029
creature from the of the century old

982
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:06,079
beyond that

983
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,009
people who work stalls and lack

984
00:46:08,009 --> 00:46:09,869
three wills okay

985
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:12,359
wire these interesting

986
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:16,009
buffalo through zombie just is
completely encoder

987
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:16,920
right just

988
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,819
dude u

989
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:23,469
get anywhere with the flow through
zombie

990
00:46:23,469 --> 00:46:25,309
the hollywood zombie

991
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:31,439
asks really interesting philosophical
and psychological question by reversing

992
00:46:31,439 --> 00:46:35,250
essentially the question about the
neural correlates of consciousness

993
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,860
will be asked about the neural
correlates of consciousness

994
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,779
what we really were asking his

995
00:46:39,779 --> 00:46:41,919
what's the difference

996
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,990
between nervous systems that can produce
consciousness

997
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,760
and nervous systems that can produce
consciousness

998
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,070
that's what we're looking for when we
look for the norrell correlates of

999
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,389
consciousness

1000
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:54,350
what i think is much more interesting

1001
00:46:54,350 --> 00:47:00,309
is the automaton question that comes to
us from the hollywood zombies which is

1002
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:02,479
zombies are behaving organisms

1003
00:47:02,479 --> 00:47:04,200
order any

1004
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,390
behavioral functions

1005
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:08,969
that require consciousness

1006
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:15,079
or their functions that would be
impossible

1007
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:16,969
have consciousness

1008
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:21,209
by asking the question about kenya how
bodies without mines in that way by

1009
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:22,910
looking at the hollywood somebody's

1010
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,909
you begin to ask a question about

1011
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:30,079
what consciousness is good for

1012
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,569
being conscious

1013
00:47:31,569 --> 00:47:34,499
buys you as aid behaving organism

1014
00:47:34,499 --> 00:47:37,379
and it turns out this is an important
question

1015
00:47:37,379 --> 00:47:42,429
not least because in modern cognitive
and social psychology

1016
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:46,079
love there's a lot of interest in a
distinction between automatic and

1017
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,229
controlled processing

1018
00:47:48,229 --> 00:47:51,389
uh... argument that there is certain

1019
00:47:51,389 --> 00:47:55,019
mental function certain behavioral
functions that are automatic in that

1020
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:56,930
they are inevitably a boat

1021
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:00,049
by the occurrence of some stimulus

1022
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:02,919
once evoked

1023
00:48:02,919 --> 00:48:06,749
runoff to exited that they're executed
in a ballistic fashion so that you can't

1024
00:48:06,749 --> 00:48:07,890
stop them

1025
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:13,489
their execution consumes noel cognitive
capacity and it doesn't interfere

1026
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:16,759
with other ongoing process he's okay

1027
00:48:16,759 --> 00:48:21,289
automatic processes are in some
important sense mindless process of the

1028
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:23,069
processes

1029
00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:27,440
modern psychology makes a nice
distinction between of some processes

1030
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,939
that are controlled

1031
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:31,369
that is conscious

1032
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:35,650
or other processes that are automatic
unconscious

1033
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,609
all of the general assumption here is
that or dramatic processing used to the

1034
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:43,729
extent that there are any automatic
processes they are all i'm conscious in

1035
00:48:43,729 --> 00:48:49,509
the strict sense of the word they are
performed

1036
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:54,869
conscious effort andy conscious
intention anne conscious awareness

1037
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:57,079
now as i said

1038
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:01,559
psychology tries to all of the what was
to distinguish between two kinds of

1039
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:04,989
process easy raising the question of
what's the next

1040
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:07,459
how much of our behavior is

1041
00:49:07,459 --> 00:49:09,030
under conscious control

1042
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,630
how much of our behavior is unconscious
an automatic

1043
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:14,679
and some individuals like

1044
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:19,769
john barge added gail university heb
argued that in fact

1045
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:25,019
almost all of our behavior is automatic
and unconscious

1046
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:28,639
most of a person's everyday life is
determined not by their conscious

1047
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:31,219
intention to deliver choices

1048
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:34,669
mental processes that are put into
motion

1049
00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:35,749
into motion

1050
00:49:35,749 --> 00:49:42,719
by features of the environment that
operate outside of conscious awareness

1051
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:44,769
this world

1052
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:47,449
consciousness by zee and often

1053
00:49:47,449 --> 00:49:48,859
mostar behavior

1054
00:49:48,859 --> 00:49:50,020
most of what we do

1055
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,059
we do automatically and unconsciously

1056
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:57,469
we are for all intents and purposes

1057
00:49:57,469 --> 00:49:59,019
without minds

1058
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:02,519
world automatons after all

1059
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:05,859
that's the argument we're going to for
the next series of lectures

1060
00:50:05,859 --> 00:50:08,079
beginning on monday

1061
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,509
thank you very much have a good weekend
