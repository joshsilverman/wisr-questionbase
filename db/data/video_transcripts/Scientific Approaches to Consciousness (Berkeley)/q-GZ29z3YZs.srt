1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,940
everything at berkeley takes longer than
it should

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,470
or clock is now fixed

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,350
that song

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,799
on the right time

5
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:12,240
let me just kind of wrap up on what we
talked about last time having to do with

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,119
the dissociate disorders

7
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,840
in modern psychiatric

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,119
taxonomy

9
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:24,129
there's a distinction made between
distorted disorders which

10
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:27,119
awareness of memory and identity

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,890
and the conversion disorders

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,140
which affect our wherein assaults
sensory perceptual functions

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,239
and all

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,390
phone fall winter and motor control

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,460
my own view is that that's a distinction
that we don't need to be uh... we don't

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,630
really need to be or making

17
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,220
because both the so-called associate
disorders and the so-called conversion

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,910
disorders involved the same underlying
pathology

19
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,510
which is a disruption in the five of the
monitoring or the controlling all

20
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,150
functions of consciousness

21
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,690
that's not attributable to any home

22
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,200
palpable bringing the unsold injury or
we're disease

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,970
and one of the young

24
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,890
interesting features of these disorders
is that they're reversible which is to

25
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,579
say they go away

26
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:11,300
eventually

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,550
on her usually quite temporary

28
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,880
and more important

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,119
all of the red of the reason why you we
should think of youths distorted

30
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:18,850
disorders

31
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:19,760
is that

32
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,390
the all

33
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,390
some but it was like a genic amnesia or
will show evidence of implicit memory

34
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,110
for things that he or she can't
consciously remember

35
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,549
and somebody with

36
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,390
so-called hysterical blindness

37
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,850
will show implicit perception for things
that he or she

38
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,560
uh... tent card catalogs

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,410
uh... cut the cc

40
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,920
so these two salsa disorders in fact

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,450
or very well name

42
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,360
because they involve

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,049
dissociation is

44
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,460
between explicit or conscious memory in
perception

45
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,770
and implicit or on conscious memory in
perception

46
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,890
so just to make this clear who can say
that they're a bunch of different kinds

47
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,650
of the sosa disorders

48
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:03,170
there's somewhere the dissociation
effects conscious memory and identity

49
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,909
energetic and beautify the genic few
multiple personality disorder

50
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:07,899
there are

51
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:12,199
dispose of disorders that affect
conscious sensation and perception

52
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,009
these so-called hysterical blindness or
deafness or whatever

53
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:16,810
and then

54
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,169
there are all of the source of disorders
that affect not conscious awareness so

55
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:23,329
much as conscious control

56
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:26,549
all the so-called historical paralysis

57
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:29,080
where are the person is not able to

58
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,889
engage in

59
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:32,049
wonder another kind of voluntarily

60
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,349
home voluntary border behavior

61
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:36,439
such as finishes up from last time

62
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:39,799
what i want to do today is to turn to

63
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:42,479
any kind of paul

64
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,979
functional dissociation called as
witnesses said punctual associations

65
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:47,060
that we see

66
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,269
in the laboratory or as well as well as
well as in the clinic

67
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:52,689
and that's hypnosis

68
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:56,760
which we can define as a social
interaction involving two people

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,649
there is a subject and there is a
hypnotist

70
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:02,149
and what they had that this does is to

71
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:07,149
goa give to the subject of policy
gestures of various sorts all forum

72
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:11,829
adjective experiences all of which
involves some kind of alteration in

73
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:12,470
consciousness

74
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,270
either alterations in perception or
memory or the voluntary control of

75
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,139
action

76
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,260
in contrast to the usual kind of a magic
of experience where i say

77
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,920
imagine that your with your dog

78
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,200
okay and you imagine that your with your
dog but you know we're about to be with

79
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,900
your arbiter with recorded they're not
really there with your dog you're really

80
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,029
here

81
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:34,670
on

82
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,240
these fault suggested hypnotic
experiences already company dipped by

83
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,009
all uncut a degree of subjected
conviction that borders on delusion

84
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,569
all of the few giveth hypnotic subjects
a suggestion that

85
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:49,889
there with their dog they really think
they're with their dog

86
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:55,099
alm had a big reopened but all of
involuntary goes through the experience

87
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:58,439
of involuntary this that borders on
compulsion

88
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,039
if i ask you go back to be with your dog
take okay uh... see whereas my dog now

89
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,589
what does he look like he's got to do
all this deliberately

90
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:07,899
all over the effort

91
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,200
but in hypnosis

92
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,259
it's as if

93
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:12,479
though experience just happens

94
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,360
on has a kind of on didn

95
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,909
on quality to it

96
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:22,279
and since the late nineteenth century
since the time of shark owa engender a m

97
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,860
armpit knows this is going to be
interested not just because of the weird

98
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,530
thing people do with psychologists ought
to be able to explain it

99
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,850
but also because

100
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,160
in some respects

101
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,699
the phenomena of hypnosis

102
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:39,289
barest stronger phenotypic resemblance
to the symptoms of hysteria

103
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:42,090
leading various investigators to think

104
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,240
or hypnosis might serve as a laboratory
model

105
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,670
for the historical into solicit
disorders

106
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,780
we could figure out what goes on in
hypnosis

107
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,570
we might have a better handle

108
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,330
hall

109
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,690
what goes on

110
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,449
you know

111
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,979
in hysteria

112
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,170
so first thing to be said it is

113
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:06,100
that not everybody who gets a hypnotic
suggestion has a hypnotic experience

114
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,620
wayy too broad individual differences in

115
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,110
hypnotize ability or the ability to
experience hypnosis

116
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,089
and these can be objectively measured by
psychological tests that were developed

117
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:20,369
in the late nineteen fifties and early
nineteen sixties

118
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:26,000
still in use today somewhat analogous to
i_q_ test is at their performance tests

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,460
he'd taken i_q_ test the test though the
examiner asks you to do berries kinds of

120
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,150
things are supposed to reveal how smart
you are

121
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,869
you know hypnotized only scale

122
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:38,259
we don't just ask you to fill out a
questionnaire that's all i would like

123
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:40,920
no's' so right i think i get the pie
smaller whatever

124
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,939
we actually try to advertise you

125
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:46,289
all and see what happens so each of
these

126
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:50,279
standardized typifies ability scales
consist of an induction procedure that

127
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,150
contains suggestions for focused
attention

128
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,419
and all relax ation high closure

129
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:59,120
eventually a subject will close his or
her audience

130
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,449
and then the expert letter goes on to
give a series of tests suggestions

131
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,270
for various kinds of hypnotic
experiences the kinds of experiences

132
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,009
that hypnotized subjected sometimes have
and the subjects response to each of

133
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:13,129
these suggestions

134
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:16,930
is a value weighted by means of some
objective

135
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,469
behavioral criteria

136
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:23,689
go above the are most important of these
were of the bodies that stanford

137
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:26,539
university in the nineteen fifties and
nineteen sixties

138
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,949
stanford hypnotic susceptibility scale

139
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:31,980
all it is a very involved not devised by
a group of harvard

140
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,910
all for group id ministration

141
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,940
all the good actually

142
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,789
quality trial hold large number of
people

143
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,199
all for them

144
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:40,630
holdover

145
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,820
group of people through the soil
procedure once my personal record is

146
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,650
about five hundred

147
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,139
on huge classroom all above the one
place

148
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,419
uh... and then there are these also
called stamper profile skills which

149
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:55,130
allow us to measure

150
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,759
very fine individual differences among
the very highly

151
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,449
on at the participle

152
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:02,020
what kinds of suggestions

153
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,099
these are the kinds of suggestions that
are on the gold standard for the

154
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:09,550
measurement of hypnotize ability
stanford scale hall form cedars and a

155
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,809
empty

156
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:11,240
bom

157
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,110
so here's the are bringing nada
conduction there's a suggestion for ite

158
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,680
closure

159
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,460
and by the end of the induction most
subjects of close to rise that's the

160
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,369
behavioral criterion for passing that
item

161
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:26,699
on then subjects are asked to put out
their hans an experienced throughout

162
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,469
uh... and uh... magic that they're
holding on the phone aia heavyweight and

163
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:35,529
their hands and the weight is pushing
their hands and arms down and if they

164
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:37,970
had the moves down specified amount

165
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,080
in over a specified period of time

166
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,110
we record the subject is passing

167
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,579
that suggestion

168
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:46,789
then later on this uh... our suggestion
from the ski tow

169
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:51,149
on distance or that there's a mosquito
buzzing ongoing lee around your head of

170
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:53,220
the like to get rid of this mosquito

171
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,380
go ahead you're but if it if you want to

172
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,470
and we see whether the subject actually

173
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,649
waves his hand on toward this

174
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:04,779
mosquito or engages in some other kind
of along that activity

175
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:05,759
all

176
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,839
on here is a boy solicitation we tell
the subject of there's a lot of speaker

177
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,180
microphone combination over on the wall
next to his chair

178
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,919
and it's going to ask a missile solo
questions like go

179
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,809
do you have any brothers or sisters

180
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,259
and we dont

181
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:22,230
dirt determine the subjects response

182
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,020
by whether he actually engages in a
conversation

183
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,039
on one-sided conversation

184
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,119
with this all homes near the boys and so
on

185
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:33,990
towards the end we might test they are
post about x ingestion

186
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,670
set up a q that after the subject comes
out of hypnosis they'll respond to it

187
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,970
all and are very frequently

188
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,270
give a suggestion for post of nautica
amnesia

189
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,250
for a time they won't be able to
remember the things they did a

190
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,780
recurrence while they were multiple
times

191
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,550
so if you count this up there are twelve
items

192
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,300
and is so you can look at how all people
representative sample of the college

193
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,560
population scores on such a orson such a
scale

194
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,190
on this is work for a lot of fun

195
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,550
judge ordered historical guard stanford
who pioneered all of this work

196
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,090
all up and it turns out

197
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,000
about forty five percent of subjects
will cripple gault score

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,690
low on the scale all dawn

199
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,899
not very important

200
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,570
not very good for the price will but the
majority of subjects about fifty five

201
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,740
percent or at least moderately at the
participle

202
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,730
although

203
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,260
all about dot twenty percent or so
highly hypnotized blow by by the the

204
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,910
standards we usually measure

205
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,360
only a very small minority about five
percent of subjects

206
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,620
horrible be called hypnotic virtual
souls

207
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,860
uh... who seem to be able to do with
just about anything you ask him to do

208
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,230
all you know if it dose is desert

209
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,750
very very very

210
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,080
interesting subjects and

211
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,860
it's a real pleasure

212
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,060
it's a real pleasure to work with them

213
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,680
most of the stuff i'll be talking about
you today

214
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,160
are phenomena veteran served in this
group of subjects hypnotic virtual isos

215
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,210
found five maybe if you're lucky ten
percent all of the aisle of of the

216
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,670
population of college students

217
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,160
but you can see climbers

218
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,559
all these phenomena

219
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,930
in all or mere mortals if you will

220
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,779
club subjects who are of somewhat lower
or sid

221
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:16,700
hypnotized going

222
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,650
the usual contrast of hypnosis research

223
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,920
is between

224
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,150
subjects who are

225
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,990
low in hypnotize building who just don't
seem to experience of nosis at all but

226
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,690
are trying their best

227
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:32,150
on and these virtual os those who seem
to be able to do all sorts of malval

228
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,000
all sorts of things

229
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,330
so what do you think

230
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,550
well we see for example for example a
whole bunch of so-called associated

231
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,790
phenomena in hypnosis

232
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,630
in post of not i can be a show we see we
find subjects who can remember things

233
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,660
that they just did or experience
moderate at the time

234
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,650
on they respond to post about extra
justin's without realized without

235
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,920
remembering the suggestion consciously
or even knowing that they're responding

236
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,570
to the suggestion

237
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,340
all bilal responder suggestions for
sidearms

238
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,030
blindness or deafness

239
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,160
on bay yelled will do it

240
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,140
not be able to start the furor

241
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,000
for home

242
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,570
receiving the cell but when you

243
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,139
when he suggested there

244
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:16,020
blinder dot

245
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,660
on hypnotic analgesia

246
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,490
talk about quite a bit they don't seem
to experience very much pain

247
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,760
wilder the prize

248
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,840
and then there are a bunch of bomb

249
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,840
phenomena that we classifies hypnotic
hallucinations

250
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,590
on you karen home

251
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,220
i suggest to somebody that they're seen
something that's not their that's a

252
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,830
positive hallucination

253
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,549
you can suggest to somebody that they
can see some particular thing

254
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:42,860
that is right there bother them

255
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,210
that's in the uh... that's a negative

256
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,010
that's a negative hallucination the g_s_
size in section this week we're going to

257
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,790
play you about the uh... about video

258
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,729
rolled but would video

259
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:57,350
double demonstrate for most of these
from one of two u

260
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,150
i don't do classroom demonstrations of
hypnosis

261
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,480
or for that matter fraternity or
sorority demonstrations

262
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,330
of witnesses

263
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,540
now what do you make of all of this

264
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,580
people while you know they're they're
wrong

265
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,650
did you get some two subjects and
suggested they see something end up

266
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,530
that they can see something to say they
consider how do you know what they

267
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,600
really see

268
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,200
all often when people look at of the
problem of hypnosis

269
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,260
they react the same way as they do
through the phenomena hysteria

270
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,300
it's fake team it's saw third the that
that they conceive perfectly well

271
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,890
called

272
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,690
whereas what's interesting about this is
that nobody ever raises these questions

273
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,540
when somebody with actual brain damage

274
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,860
exactly the same thing

275
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,520
when age and came out of his surgery in
nineteen fifty three and couldn't

276
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,899
remember anything

277
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,100
nobody ever said yes you can

278
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,180
on nobody ever said that a gem was
faking

279
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,630
on his up his amnesia

280
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:01,180
ald with dvd the blind slight patient
study by widespread citizen so since

281
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,480
nobody ever claimed

282
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,700
that d_b_ really quincy

283
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,050
all of the things he said he couldn't
see

284
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,520
which leads into what i am sometimes
called the hysteria hypnosis paradox

285
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,420
which there's a group of the desert
there's arts school in psychology

286
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:22,420
that won't believe the self reports of
people unless their brain damaged

287
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,650
any kind of gotta wonder kind of what
the logic is arm behind that right

288
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,370
also of

289
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,010
look at this kind of

290
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,610
alicia leah some things that kind of

291
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,930
that i've got a hope will convince you a
little bit that the self reports the

292
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,490
beget forget the pie subject

293
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,760
do have some validity do seem to have
some truth elliott's but the whole idea

294
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,670
i mean

295
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,040
cognitive neuroscience and gunmen
cognitive neuropsychology is built on

296
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,890
accepting that face value the self
reports of people who were brain-damaged

297
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,660
right

298
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,570
also want to do it in other domains

299
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,500
old as well

300
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,990
here's a good example and that's with
ought hypnotic analgesia suggestions for

301
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,460
the hypnotic relief of pain

302
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,600
which since the eighteen forties before
the discovery of chemical analgesia

303
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,530
floyd and and anesthesia

304
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:17,190
have been used to all offer patients are
thought of substantial all of the

305
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,520
substantial pain relief

306
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,580
even in major surgeries like
appendectomy xenon caesarean sections

307
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,809
and off

308
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,460
orthopedic surgery and all sorts of oil

309
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,110
all sorts of things like that

310
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,710
now what's interesting about this

311
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,600
all about hypnotic analgesia

312
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,160
is that this is something that could be
studied both in the clinic with real

313
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,120
patients and real pain

314
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,629
and in the laboratory

315
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,049
with normal subjects people like you
would be

316
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:46,759
all who are having pain inflicted on
them by some kind of of laboratory all

317
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,540
of them procedure

318
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,610
here is a study bygone bernadette post
review actually bug-eyed montgomery in

319
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,430
his associates at the university of
connecticut

320
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,740
or meta-analysis is awful

321
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,220
analysis of various kinds of fell asleep
at the post

322
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,470
puts a whole bunch of studies together

323
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,690
all looking at the effectiveness of
hypnotic suggestions for analogies here

324
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,860
both across on what large number of
clinical studies

325
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,740
and across a large number of laboratory
studies

326
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,820
and what you can see here is

327
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,510
the overall effect size of hypnotic
suggestions for our parameters yet is a

328
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,090
very substantial

329
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:26,270
in social science research small effect
is about an effect ballpoint too

330
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,560
moderate size the factors that affect
orwell points of wellpoint dodo to two

331
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,270
point four so bigger facts are affects
salt with with with affect slices of

332
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,630
greater than point six

333
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,710
and that's exactly what we see here
these are substantial walking affects

334
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,819
on the are

335
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:44,630
on the perception of pain

336
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,630
both in the

337
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:50,300
kind of sterile artificial confines of
the psychological laboratory

338
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,849
and

339
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:51,959
in the applied

340
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,430
uh... confines of the clinic

341
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,020
this is called kind of uh... the echoes
the point that made before

342
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,870
the extent of obsolete of response to
suggestions for pain

343
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,900
is highly correlated with with with
hypnotic susceptibility

344
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,240
here we have people who score high on
all hypnotize abilities skills like that

345
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,590
standard form see that i told you about
before

346
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,550
and they're getting these wap in effect
sizes i mean these are nuclear physics

347
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,960
sized effect sizes right

348
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,180
alm

349
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,370
fear even subject some moderate

350
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,220
hypnotize ability can get substantial
pain relief

351
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,130
if i could tell you before you go into a
dental procedure we're going in for a

352
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,100
role

353
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,580
perot patient surgery

354
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,630
that by means of hypnosis i could reduce
your filled pain by one-third you take

355
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,670
it

356
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,150
alm and that's what we can get

357
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,540
in susceptible subjects

358
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,440
not so much

359
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,060
but even they can get a little bit of
pain relieving and susceptible subjects

360
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,670
get a little bit of pain relief

361
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,830
all promo from hypnotic suggestions

362
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,510
so what can you do here again bulb

363
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,580
because it will be to bring this
phenomenon into the laboratory in study

364
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,530
of under controlled conditions

365
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:05,670
he resolved research fight over argues
in a phenomenon called cold pressor

366
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,470
paying

367
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,220
you take a subjects forearm

368
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,380
and you

369
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,829
immersive circulating ice water

370
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:16,160
paul all about the water that sad zero
degrees centigrade and kept it but that

371
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,650
that uh... felt that uh...

372
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,770
of uh... printed return right

373
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,010
pause while on code kept it in there and
just take you're not going to feel any

374
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,010
pain

375
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,800
dawn record feeling your arms like
rubber you don't feel any pain at all

376
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,059
and the question is

377
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:33,770
or what kind of how much pain to
subjects experience organise and again

378
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,500
as in the clinical studies

379
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,410
you can see

380
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,710
that in susceptible subjects don't get
very much pain relief

381
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,870
subjects a medium hypnotize building get
more pain relief

382
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,650
ballpark at the price will be just
substantial amount of pain relief

383
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,090
all particular procedure

384
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,990
palm

385
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,810
here's all another very interesting
study by john started as associates at

386
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,700
washington university in saint louis

387
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,050
subjects called the beaver laboratory
subjects

388
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,780
through a whole bunch of different kinds
of the experimental procedures using

389
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,419
both

390
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,990
cold pressor pain that's the were seen
in arm often now in cold water

391
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,140
which in effect

392
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,740
and what's known as this gimmick muscle
pain this is a very interesting kind of

393
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,480
pain

394
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,680
where u

395
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,130
fallen use a blood pressure cough and a
clue dl flow of blood too though

396
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:23,690
forearm

397
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,280
and then u_s_ the person to do some work
with the forearm which exhausts the

398
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,700
oxygen

399
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,350
in waffles

400
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:35,190
and begins to or hurt like hell overall
very very very short criticizes on

401
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,100
believe oblique

402
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,429
best analog for clinical pain we've got

403
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:45,090
really are really great analog they'd
and your arm is turning technicolor

404
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,059
cousins dr dot the floods out of it in
all this kind of stuff

405
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:52,260
and so what they died they brought
subjects and fault though for this

406
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,730
although challenge the payment a whole
bunch of different kinds of treatments

407
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,720
hypnosis acupuncture placebo acupuncture
morphine aspirin all a bunch of other

408
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,900
drugs and all of that

409
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,929
and then looked at the comparative
effectiveness of these various kinds of

410
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:07,620
treatments

411
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,670
and the really interesting finding here
was that

412
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,790
of all these treatments

413
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,360
hypnosis gave the best

414
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,290
better then

415
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,780
true or placebo acupuncture better than
morphine workings not so good in the

416
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,290
laboratory for reasons that are not
completely clear it's great clinic but

417
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,700
it's not so good laboratory

418
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,540
aspirin halt world

419
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,980
or so on

420
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,030
although the compared to other kinds of
challenging agents

421
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,210
hypnosis is

422
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:44,210
pretty august frequent nala pick your
question

423
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,410
malcontent

424
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,960
there aren't any ethics issues because
there were informed consent

425
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,980
part of the procedures are we would
never ever do anything like this

426
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,040
well with subjects without them knowing
that we're going to do it

427
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,010
well when we do have nosis research in
my laboratory subjects know that there's

428
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,360
going to be hypnosis involved a
volunteer for it

429
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,130
so anybody does want to be hypnotized
will they get there

430
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,650
are keeping credit someplace else

431
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,820
song

432
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,630
diapering ever going to do anything
idon't think pain research myself

433
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,940
all but if we're ever going to do pain
research we would make sure that

434
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,050
subjects know what that's all

435
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,220
and no alright your arms turning
technicolor dot hurts like hell but

436
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,600
uh... goes away

437
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,760
all on the pretty fast is no there's no
organ damage or anything like that

438
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,750
all but

439
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,330
in this kind of research as in any kind
of research

440
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,010
informed consent is really important
it's absolutely critical

441
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:39,950
that subjects

442
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,840
nor what they're in for

443
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,289
before earth day well before they vote

444
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:46,040
tho before they

445
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,820
signed the contract as the world

446
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:54,820
uh... to super tuesday studies

447
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,320
or we have done

448
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,220
welcome dot typical under typical
induction of hypnosis will take about

449
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,280
fifteen min

450
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,890
yet they go to a whole procedure

451
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,410
so what we do is we could we know that
subjects are in susceptible to have no

452
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:26,730
sister highly hit the prize of all we
put all through the same procedure

453
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,250
on to see how good to see other respond
there are lots of their lots of design

454
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,380
issues in hypnosis researcher lots of
different ways to do it

455
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,160
all but the

456
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,790
that what i just described as the
standard basic paradigm for hypnosis

457
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,690
research

458
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,670
and the logic behind it is

459
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,150
on hypnotize will people ten experience
difficult since right

460
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,110
that but i think people can experience
opposes

461
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,450
all but otherwise

462
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,120
the nice thing is that

463
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,000
there aren't that there aren't serious
personality differences between high

464
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,650
above the proposal people so it's not as
if you're getting

465
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,920
or one kind of person and hypnosis
liberal mother kind of person

466
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,330
uh... otherwise

467
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:08,150
and there's really no way for us to
predict advisability of events either

468
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,590
onto the best

469
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,480
questionnaire coral of the fifth the
price ability of some fizzled

470
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,130
procedure called absorption

471
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,370
or subjects report all i get swept away
by sunset sore

472
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,200
i really get a group on what i'm
listening the in a ghada devito or

473
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,570
something like that

474
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,489
fallen and

475
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:26,359
those people tend to be a little bit
more highly of the prize of all than

476
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,369
everybody else

477
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:29,260
but the correlation is crumbling

478
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,860
it's point two oh

479
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,000
one point two oh if you're lucky

480
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
on and uh... that's just not enough to
service prediction

481
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,690
you all the way to know what somebody
said the price war

482
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,940
is to try to hit the tides and see if it
works

483
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,230
that's what the standard by skills were
all about

484
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:51,230
quick questions and then i gotta go on
iran never going to finish

485
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,010
it could certainly defer given the mood
and state of mind all because

486
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,450
performance on anything will be willed
it will be forgiven border state of mind

487
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,870
it could be the smartest person in the
world but if you don't

488
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,690
feel like it that day you're going to
flunk you're right cuteness

489
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,290
and it's exactly the same way

490
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,640
on here

491
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,090
on if you don't want to be hypnotize you
don't get hypnotize no matter what

492
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,000
no matter what the hypnotist does

493
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,100
in a very work in a very real sense of
all hypnosis is self hypnosis

494
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,609
and what they have the first really does
the doesn't put you in hypnosis

495
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:29,210
he tells you what to do it a put
yourself in

496
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,530
hypnosis

497
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,669
and uh... i've got to be in my career
i've done a lot of hypnosis research

498
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:37,100
i've worked with very experienced a
product subjects and i've become they've

499
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,150
become a one point right

500
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,780
i start my fifteen minutes hypnotic
induction patronizing

501
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,100
on people get myself in hypnosis and

502
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,680
on what you know what i'm ready and it
works just like

503
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,380
as i know what to do

504
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,360
thicket well here it's not a secure hit
over the head in hypnosis upon

505
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,760
you can give you can still talk about
forgive your suggestion that there can

506
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,810
speak anymore

507
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:09,810
you have some difficulty

508
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,559
mold ya

509
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,240
there but it's not just a difference of
allowing yourself or not

510
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,270
it's

511
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,049
it's like

512
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:19,470
it's really a skill

513
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,540
so you can view the greatest tennis
player in the world but if you don't

514
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:28,950
wanna play that day okay you're not
gonna play that day asking andrey agassi

515
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,020
all

516
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,540
if u our auction lumped like me

517
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,980
nothing in the world is going to make me
a world-class tennis player it's just

518
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,070
not going to happen

519
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:44,250
so it's not just a matter of ap of of
attitude or or or or wanting to do with

520
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,210
with all skilled performance

521
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,260
all all they cross the domain of
psychology

522
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,919
on performances of functional

523
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,220
interaction between

524
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,749
aptitude

525
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:55,679
you have the ability or not

526
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,879
and attitude

527
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:59,300
do ya wanna

528
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,080
palm

529
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,760
through and got out of both

530
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,520
and these subjects how both cause or
pain number they heard their interests

531
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,960
interested or whatever

532
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,390
but nothing in the world is going to
make somebody that the times more who's

533
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,700
not

534
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,570
it or more details about this there's a
lot of the lecture supplements i want to

535
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,190
strip club

536
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,190
the business about

537
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,519
how you get hypnotized more on and all
that and go right into on the berries

538
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,820
and very secure words

539
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,900
also okay that was all

540
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,150
doubles the cold pressor pain here is
the same kind of all fucking pattern of

541
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,920
findings

542
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,789
for all

543
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:34,960
for ischemic pain

544
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,000
and it turns out when you do psycho
physics to find out that there are

545
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,270
actually two components to the
experience of pain talked about this

546
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:41,890
election

547
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,050
earlier i think

548
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,420
there's what's known as sensory pain

549
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,580
which provides the person with
information about the location and

550
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,470
extent of some injury

551
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,339
and this will be call suffering

552
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:55,280
which has to do with the meanie

553
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,669
all the sensory

554
00:25:56,669 --> 00:26:00,220
all pain these are just so civil
components of bald

555
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,890
of the pain experienced

556
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,510
and you might think well hypnosis
doesn't do anything to sensory pain the

557
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,690
pain still there

558
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,320
all somehow it doesn't bother

559
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,220
the patient all window or door or the
subject is much

560
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,330
on that turns out not to be true this is
work by jane oxfam queen's university in

561
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:19,100
canada

562
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,080
in which she collected

563
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,620
separate reports of sensory pain and of
suffering

564
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,779
from her subjects

565
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:29,419
and found the both of them were
substantially reduced so it's not just

566
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:31,580
operated on the so-called

567
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,970
psychological or emotional component of
pain

568
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,600
it's really operate on the pain
experienced

569
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,870
appoint all come back to on you know

570
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,700
okay so what do we make of this

571
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,730
aud dog john entails qatar surgeon
working in india are before the advent

572
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,659
of chemical are

573
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:50,180
anesthetics

574
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,960
all used to be nosis job with his
patience almost exclusively and had

575
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,040
quite a bit of success about it

576
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,810
and he kind of all of the big even he in
eighteen forty three eighteen forty four

577
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:04,540
faced what what i've called the hysteria
hypnosis paradox which is that people

578
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,590
just don't believe this

579
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,759
on and uh... as bill says you know

580
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:12,929
iv's i'd like to all the is reporting on
a whole series of volcanic ball

581
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:13,480
surgeries

582
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,600
major surgeries and which would knows
this was the only

583
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,710
analgesic agent

584
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,879
and he said the

585
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:21,360
i go least able to ways of accounting
for this

586
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,870
the first one you know all of my
patients also dob

587
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,270
well the the doctors an idiot

588
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,540
all he called me to pieces for twenty
minutes and i need to believe that i did

589
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:31,980
not

590
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,050
feel it at all

591
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,559
alm and and then kind of encouraging his
family members to go to

592
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,559
play the same joke on the doctor

593
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:40,499
all poor

594
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:41,590
they say they are

595
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,789
phone them for their brother sulfurous

596
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:46,950
look at me i've gotten rid of my carmike
burden

597
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,760
home uh...

598
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,760
while he didn't do this when i was about
a really didn't feel anything and that's

599
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,909
the experience

600
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:56,860
of subjects both in the clinic

601
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,840
laboratory

602
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,840
as dale

603
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,789
you can see what the date is here as
bill wrote this song monograph reporting

604
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:09,399
on problem hundreds of cases of surgery
successfully completed with the with

605
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:11,610
hypnosis is in full

606
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,169
unfold analgesic agent

607
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:17,160
right at exactly the same time as

608
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,190
was

609
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,309
demonstrating parental g flooded you
throughout the season for the first time

610
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:26,070
and uh... as i said there are big
individual differences responses nosis

611
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,640
but there are not big individual
differences in response to

612
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,530
onto easter another chemical island
anesthetic agents

613
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,409
and for that reason

614
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:40,289
i mean was crummy all pretty quickly or
hypnosis was kind of broad displaced

615
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:42,780
from the medical armament her room

616
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,240
small body home

617
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,920
by chemical anesthetics

618
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,880
but recently cards come back into along

619
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,209
from the comeback in the favor this is
work by our

620
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:55,170
workbook are weapons

621
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,720
all bio by relying

622
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,320
all was a dollop yard

623
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,290
on the position at harvard of harvard
medical school

624
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,119
who was not an anesthesiologist

625
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,550
uh... portable bunch of outpatient of
those surgeries

626
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:12,750
all of which employ conscious sedation
and patient controlled analgesia which i

627
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,990
described for you

628
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,720
a couple of weeks ago

629
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,249
and what lange did

630
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:20,669
was as an adjuncts as an add-on

631
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:23,260
party their days subjects of

632
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,700
idea of the giver patients on at the
uh... hypnotic induction and uh...

633
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,330
suggestions for analgesia reduced pain

634
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,530
or an attention manipulation basically
gave them a little distracting has and

635
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,260
looked at

636
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,100
added value might be of hypnosis

637
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,650
when you added to chemical

638
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,810
called chemical analgesia

639
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,510
and what you file found

640
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,010
was that the calm

641
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,110
uh... for that

642
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,620
did the added value nosis was all quite
quite great

643
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,650
here in black we see

644
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,210
all of them

645
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,570
uh... supplementation these are
conscious patients this is out patient

646
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,539
surgery conscious sedation

647
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:01,190
all to see that

648
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,050
all over the course of the procedure or
their reported pain

649
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,890
on goes up quite a bit

650
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,830
uh... when u

651
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,490
give the media attention the distracted
manipulation

652
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:14,610
all modulates

653
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:19,350
the pain somewhat bob when you add
hypnosis the pain actually goes down

654
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,320
over the course

655
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,970
of the arm of the midwest to again this
is clinical pain

656
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,180
usurpation real patients have been real
surgeries

657
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,300
or and off

658
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,870
hypnosis add something

659
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,850
on to well

660
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,570
to the procedure

661
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,600
dog lag is involved in a sort of what
we've done some

662
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,450
medical economic study showing

663
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,559
that hypnosis adding hypnosis out
actually cost effective

664
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:44,070
so do a little bit of extra charge for
the hypnotist

665
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,620
all by palm

666
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,929
that actually

667
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:51,110
that charge is compensated for

668
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,169
fewer side effects of the procedure on
uh...

669
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:56,350
less post-operative pain

670
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,070
wrong

671
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:04,070
vandals were two other things

672
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,059
that's exactly right so they get their
debt they're digging their drip

673
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:11,550
bulb although vault of bob ends up as a
painter of whatever

674
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,679
and they're going to go since with the
same time

675
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,520
exactly so

676
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:21,070
so you get this bill of this nice effect
so i don't want to do that

677
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,990
all get to get you to a brain imaging
studies i like your of them very quickly

678
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,210
all

679
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,799
altered which comes from pier rain bill
whose own neuroscientist at uh... about

680
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,820
at mcgill all university

681
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,920
he used a uh... this in the laboratory
study

682
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,980
palm

683
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,429
which archaea uh...

684
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:41,590
used at

685
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,140
different procedure too

686
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,720
put subjects in pain

687
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,559
which is not as hot presser remember
cool presser

688
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,700
you over some persons are banned

689
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,470
of circulating uh... circulate ice water

690
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,369
in hot presser you apply some electrodes
that paul

691
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:00,129
that heat to the skin won't damage the
skin

692
00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:02,880
massively room on there for hours

693
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,050
but that they cats

694
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:05,880
it's painful

695
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,409
just like a kid touched off

696
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:09,740
very hostile or whatever

697
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,630
and then what he did was to give
subjects are hypnotic suggestions

698
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,289
that we're gearing simply to alter that
you call

699
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:17,840
that the plaza

700
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,230
you unpleasantness of the pain the sun's
the you know

701
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,700
the those suffering

702
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,810
component of pain and the nice thing is
that they did this inside a pet machine

703
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:30,020
so these are the subjects were we're all
of them

704
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,620
their brains were scanned

705
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,859
uh... at the uh...

706
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:35,190
at the time that they were going through
all this

707
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,500
and he looked at all i had to order for
regions of the brain

708
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:44,320
the primaries some out a sensory cortex
which is responsive to sensory pain

709
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,309
all records the location and the
intensity

710
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:50,030
of pain in various parts of body

711
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,480
and the anterior cingulate cortex

712
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,980
which moderates the of the suffering
component

713
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,399
volvo of pain

714
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:00,500
uh... it's a motion or on significance

715
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,230
and the first thing hard to be said here
is that

716
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,580
in terms of subjects self reports

717
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,740
you could actually see

718
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,130
telling people

719
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,020
they would prob have reduced suffering
from the pain

720
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,770
no-till reduction in the intensity of
the page

721
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:19,980
it's intended effect

722
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,170
and terms of self reports is a nice
reduction in

723
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,650
rated on pleasant us

724
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,830
no substantial reduction

725
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,570
and uh... in intensity

726
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,440
but the really interesting thing here

727
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,880
is what you see in the brain scan

728
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,310
let me see if i can

729
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:40,390
clothes off

730
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,799
and what you can see palms

731
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,550
on fears the enter rear of the dancing
itos cingulate cortex

732
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,510
you can see that there is essentially no
modification

733
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,900
called him the response was not a
sensory cortex between

734
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,760
height of the price of oil over to the
principal subjects

735
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,560
but there is a substantial

736
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,800
or reduction an activity in the anterior
cingulate cortex when these subjects

737
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,980
say they are

738
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,249
that those just doesn't bother them

739
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:11,000
so here you have one of these nice
little

740
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,359
home or in the brain

741
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:16,839
of the affects where the change in the
subjects experience

742
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:20,980
as a result of hypnotic suggestion does
seem to be reflected

743
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,700
in the changes in the subjects

744
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,010
or brain activity

745
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,030
there is reduced activity here

746
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:30,459
in the anterior in the interior single
cortex

747
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:33,409
there aren't that many brain imaging
studies that have no system to show you

748
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:40,409
another one

749
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,980
okay so

750
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,309
that's pain

751
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:48,369
here's another hypnotic phenomena is
what i've studied quite a bit called

752
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:49,969
posted nomic amnesia

753
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:52,869
where we kept the price subjects we
teach them a list of words during

754
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:53,959
hypnosis

755
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:57,019
give my suggestion that they will
remember the words that they've learned

756
00:34:57,019 --> 00:34:57,759
that was

757
00:34:57,759 --> 00:34:59,299
that there is any words

758
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:00,969
when the commodity nosis

759
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:04,459
until we give them a suggestion to
cancel the amnesia suggestion

760
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:06,419
now you can remember everything

761
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:08,489
so we do that

762
00:35:08,489 --> 00:35:11,299
and then we give them a bunch of ball

763
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:13,159
of uh... memory test

764
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:15,099
here's all the rear of the results of
tests of

765
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:16,549
free recall

766
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:17,410
subjects are

767
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,400
low

768
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,449
medium height he's a virtual so subjects

769
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:22,680
and what you can see is

770
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,320
in susceptible subjects they don't
respond to the admission suggestion very

771
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,640
much the remember things perfectly well

772
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,329
sort of the subjects of medium at the
price billy

773
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:35,799
highly hypnotize ble subjects are
showing some degree caldwell of amnesia

774
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:36,939
here

775
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:39,119
alm and the virtual so subject

776
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,930
then i'll remember anything

777
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,009
then when you cancel the suggestion it
all comes back

778
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:44,880
these subjects

779
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,640
are now able to remember onwards

780
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,170
that they weren't able to remember

781
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,709
all of the previously

782
00:35:50,709 --> 00:35:53,709
this is a test of free recall it's a
test of

783
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:56,340
explicit memory folding next question is

784
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,279
what would happen if you gave these
subjects attest of implicit memory

785
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:02,390
we did that

786
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:07,109
all here is with what we did was to give
subject supriya association fast

787
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:11,029
where the stimuli for the free
association coast

788
00:36:11,029 --> 00:36:12,759
strongly associated

789
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:15,109
they were they were associated anyway

790
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:19,129
with the uh... with the yard target
words of the subjects of memorized three

791
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:19,919
nosis

792
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:21,970
so we give the stimulus boy

793
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,499
they had studied

794
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:24,539
words like girl

795
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:28,170
share flowers and short we gave the
stimulus boy

796
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,999
asking the people support for the came
to mind

797
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:33,329
the first were the came to mind

798
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:37,219
the first were the came to mind and
uh... and so on there were also some

799
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:37,830
control

800
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,649
of stimuli the day

801
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:42,490
before related words they hadn't studied

802
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,180
and what you can see here

803
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,169
is that

804
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:49,549
the in susceptible subjects who remember
the words that they had studied during

805
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:51,490
hypnosis perfectly well

806
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,569
showed a very nice primeval fact

807
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:58,449
so they're more likely to produce this
card as responses on the bundy board

808
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,779
association says

809
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:02,059
alternatives that they had studied
during hypnosis

810
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:03,989
but what you see here is

811
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:08,529
the same primate affect in the virtual
also subjects who were completely

812
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:12,210
amnesia then i'll remember the words
that they studied during hypnosis

813
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,000
yet they are

814
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,209
just as likely

815
00:37:14,209 --> 00:37:18,599
as the in susceptible subjects to
produce on his words as well

816
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,039
and three associates

817
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:23,670
so again there's now a lot of evidence
this is the first of these studies

818
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:28,459
know a lot of evidence the suggestions
for post if not i can be shipped

819
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:29,440
impair

820
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,250
explicit memory or conscious
recollection

821
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,519
of things that happened during hypnosis

822
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:39,249
but they have no effect on implicit
memory these kind of unconscious

823
00:37:39,249 --> 00:37:39,999
influences

824
00:37:39,999 --> 00:37:41,159
of the

825
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,659
of the study experience

826
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:45,889
here as well

827
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,800
similar studies with with that we used
our own

828
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,960
uh... category

829
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,900
uh... numbers

830
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,460
in explicit memory when you reverse the
amnesia

831
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,259
all the memories come back

832
00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:01,139
but in this particular experiment

833
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:03,619
the subject studied women's first name
is

834
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:04,979
body parts

835
00:38:04,979 --> 00:38:06,899
for footed outils

836
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:08,859
on times

837
00:38:08,859 --> 00:38:11,380
home and all we asked them

838
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,119
simply too

839
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,189
first woman's name it comes to mind
first body part the comes to mind first

840
00:38:17,189 --> 00:38:17,589
animal

841
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:22,319
that that comes to mind and dot and so
on

842
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:24,550
what you see here teaches

843
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,119
very nice priming effect

844
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,789
for subjects are more likely

845
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:32,930
the ences apple subject to remember the
items perfectly well are more likely to

846
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,950
all produce

847
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,579
items from the study blisters free
associates

848
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:39,729
exactly the same priming effect

849
00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:43,749
from the virtual so subject who dole
remember the list

850
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:45,959
again another demonstration

851
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:49,349
the dissociation between explicit

852
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:52,989
and implicitly

853
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:54,350
on skipping over this

854
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,029
for a second cousins

855
00:38:57,029 --> 00:38:58,390
it'll take me to one

856
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:02,749
you can see the same kinds of
dissociation is

857
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:07,839
in the perceptual domain dissociation
between explicit and implicit perception

858
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,199
here is a study by richard bryant and
kevin mccarty than at macquarie

859
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,830
university and not in australia

860
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,559
on hypnotic blindness

861
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:19,329
took a bunch of virtual so hypnotic
subjects

862
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:20,979
gave them a suggestion that

863
00:39:20,979 --> 00:39:22,230
for the time being

864
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,599
even though the rise rope and they
wouldn't be able to see things at work

865
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,660
that were all

866
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,229
over in front of them

867
00:39:28,229 --> 00:39:31,919
on has had the subjects open their eyes
can you see this could be a little

868
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:34,569
frightening for subjects

869
00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:39,169
all of these subjects were on word well
used to hypnotic procedures they that

870
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:41,660
they've been lots of other experiments
before so

871
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,759
they were able to

872
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,279
what's going on

873
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:50,009
and at what called the what they did
while they're always were open but they

874
00:39:50,009 --> 00:39:53,019
said they couldn't see anything

875
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:54,169
albright in the country

876
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:55,670
who held up cards

877
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,970
that that don't work based on that bike
experiment hundai comic listening i

878
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,050
showed you before

879
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,960
that consisted of a printed hollow phone

880
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,190
plus a descent big you waiting for you

881
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,749
warren peace

882
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:12,380
toward us some of these words were
presented while the subject was hypnotic

883
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,220
we blind couldn't see them

884
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,639
said he couldn't see them

885
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:19,029
others were presented while the subject
was not could not agree blind you can

886
00:40:19,029 --> 00:40:21,219
see them perfectly well

887
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:25,339
and then later on all day followed up
with a memory test

888
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,980
and that spelling test

889
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,869
in which they were presented with the
hubble phones

890
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:30,880
or hair

891
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,560
and asked

892
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,229
how they would spell it

893
00:40:33,229 --> 00:40:37,579
obviously as in the eye can experiment i
showed you of earlier

894
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:38,430
on if u

895
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:44,400
actually process this did spell peace
p_d_a_s c_e_o_ supposed to p r_u_c_

896
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,430
if you all that you would actually
process the somehow

897
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,609
did spell hair h_ a_ r_ t_

898
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:52,439
which nobody ever does

899
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:57,089
as opposed to all as opposed to age a
high are

900
00:40:57,089 --> 00:40:58,689
here is the all

901
00:40:58,689 --> 00:40:59,230
pollen

902
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,709
the art of results

903
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,609
on wrote from rome

904
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:04,459
recall

905
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,129
all of this them subjects

906
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:08,880
didn't recall any all the words that

907
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,420
they had not seen

908
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,099
you don't consciously perceive something
you're not going to consciously remember

909
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:15,140
appalling either

910
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,270
but wasn't from what was interesting
here is that

911
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,400
the subjects showed

912
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,889
a big priming effect on the hubble phone
spelling test

913
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:24,710
so that

914
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,299
they were more likely

915
00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:29,029
you would expect by chance

916
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:31,359
to show that had to spell peace

917
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,859
p_ a c_

918
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:34,080
forestville hair

919
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,989
h a already

920
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:39,919
showing that despite the fact that they
didn't have the conscious experience of

921
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:45,599
seeing nevertheless the visual stimulus
godin was processed was processed for

922
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,979
meaning and influence their performance

923
00:41:47,979 --> 00:41:49,579
on this priming test

924
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:52,509
in the same way that posted melodic
engager

925
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:56,539
the star dissociate explicit an implicit
memory

926
00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:00,629
conscious memory from unconscious
influences of memory

927
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:04,509
phenomenon like hypnotic blindness seems
to dissociate

928
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:06,070
explicit and implicit

929
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:06,959
perception

930
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:10,449
conscious perception is missing is
impaired

931
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:14,059
unconscious perception as revealed by
these priming effects

932
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:15,270
pretty much com

933
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,899
are pretty much spirit

934
00:42:17,899 --> 00:42:21,199
okay we're not going to talk about post
a blog suggestions

935
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,109
instead

936
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:24,599
what we're going to do

937
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,900
hong

938
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,530
with all the really interesting study
called

939
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:34,219
the hypnotic alterations in color
perception workplace even cost money

940
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:39,469
on ben at harvard university's now back
at stanford worth of his p_h_d_

941
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:40,020
arm

942
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,220
that it's another one of these pet
imaging studies

943
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,980
he studies were done a little while ago
also too

944
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,880
mod will bother people don't do pet
imaging anymore but pet imaging has one

945
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,790
advantage over f_m_ arrive when you're
doing hypnosis research

946
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:53,640
and that is

947
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,149
that its client

948
00:42:56,149 --> 00:42:59,679
the aftermarket she's on believable in
origin

949
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,189
and it's very difficult that there are
some studies of people sleeping and i'm

950
00:43:03,189 --> 00:43:03,960
alright machines are

951
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,320
i don't know how they do it

952
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,109
my honest to god i don't know how to do
it

953
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:08,759
palm

954
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:09,689
but all

955
00:43:09,689 --> 00:43:14,029
uh... it's just it's just not easy to
get in state at the price before that

956
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:16,469
bangin inclined going on but pat is

957
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,599
pretty quiet

958
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,049
and so that's actually the preferred
brain imaging procedure

959
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:23,939
offer these kinds of experiments anyway

960
00:43:23,939 --> 00:43:29,989
what kozol unpaired wants to look at the
consequences for brain activity of

961
00:43:29,989 --> 00:43:33,150
hypnotic suggestions for color blindness

962
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:37,189
and four color on them for a and for
colourful insulation

963
00:43:37,189 --> 00:43:38,339
the employed

964
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:41,670
patterns like this in fact these are the
patrons he employed

965
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:44,639
all you can see this is a uh... but
uh... you know

966
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:46,299
that colored pattern

967
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:48,849
this is phone grayscale pattern

968
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:52,350
where different blocks and and and
rectangles

969
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:56,760
have exactly the same brightness and
intensity as the color blocks they're

970
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,169
just devoid of any color

971
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,499
uh... brandeis control

972
00:44:01,499 --> 00:44:04,279
so all bloody what caused you and dad

973
00:44:04,279 --> 00:44:05,170
was to take

974
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,439
hypnotic subjects is our again virtual
so subjects

975
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:12,210
and a custom under a couple of different
conditions

976
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:12,669
ald

977
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:16,140
he would present them with the colored
pattern

978
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,900
suggests of them that they're just seen
a ordinarily as uh... as it was in color

979
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,910
and than all later on

980
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,240
he would uh... present them with the
colored pattern

981
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,809
and give them a suggestion

982
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:30,580
that they'd they were that that they
have lost all color vision

983
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:34,499
and they're all the caller was draining
out of the stimulus

984
00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:37,719
all so that they would put all these cdi
grayscale

985
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:40,680
anymore this practically and negative
hallucination

986
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,979
because you are

987
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:45,050
that since the suggestion is that you
won't be able to see something

988
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,130
that's right there

989
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,259
in front of you

990
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:49,509
so those are the first two conditions

991
00:44:49,509 --> 00:44:53,769
in the third condition you presented
subject of the gray scale pattern and

992
00:44:53,769 --> 00:44:55,189
ethnicity and grayscale

993
00:44:55,189 --> 00:44:58,259
okay just see it the way you do
ordinarily see it

994
00:44:58,259 --> 00:44:59,689
and in the last condition

995
00:44:59,689 --> 00:45:03,130
he asked them presented the gray scale
pattern

996
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:04,319
now colorist

997
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,260
flowing into the started it into the
stimulus

998
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,780
the same colors that you can also a
before

999
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,450
that's technically a positive
hallucination subjects actually said

1000
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,680
that they experienced these things

1001
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,019
when he's asked me to see the color
pattern in color

1002
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:19,500
they could name the colors

1003
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,509
when u_s_ in ought to see the color
pattern in grayscale they couldn't

1004
00:45:23,509 --> 00:45:27,819
when you ask him to see the gray scale
pattern and color they pointed to

1005
00:45:27,819 --> 00:45:32,199
various colors or pumping even though
there was no colder in the stimulus

1006
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:34,250
now that's their standard hypnotic a
fact

1007
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:38,600
the question is what's going on with the
brain the reason we asked this question

1008
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:45,600
is that there are certain

1009
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:52,380
uh...

1010
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,149
yes they work

1011
00:45:54,149 --> 00:45:55,190
hall died

1012
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,879
dot on dot showed what

1013
00:45:56,879 --> 00:46:00,599
but but yes they were reduced wanted to
use one stimulus

1014
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,059
they gave the important thing is alm

1015
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:03,890
and that this is

1016
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:06,319
perhaps above the small glitch in the
experiment

1017
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,049
he counterbalance all these conditions

1018
00:46:09,049 --> 00:46:13,630
so across conditions the order a
presentation of these tests or was uh...

1019
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:15,640
what what what what was different

1020
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,419
we'll plan

1021
00:46:16,419 --> 00:46:19,379
the color was supposed to flow in

1022
00:46:19,379 --> 00:46:23,039
he didn't speak didn't specify any
particular color

1023
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:24,399
out here

1024
00:46:24,399 --> 00:46:24,970
alone

1025
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:28,990
and with great skill ups subjects were
experienced all with with the preschool

1026
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,019
patterns and with that

1027
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:32,010
this is

1028
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:32,589
this

1029
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:39,589
is what this pattern would look like if
you were totally colorblind

1030
00:46:46,009 --> 00:46:49,309
no because it's been so i think that
this was the first thing goes they would

1031
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,149
have known what colors

1032
00:46:51,149 --> 00:46:54,479
there were but there was color

1033
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:57,520
arsov subjects called and said that they
saw

1034
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,540
blues and reds and yellows and greens
and all that kind of stuff and what's

1035
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,120
interesting about this is

1036
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,810
but there is not part called the brain

1037
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:09,469
known as the fuse a form cholerae up for
those of you who got some neuroscience

1038
00:47:09,469 --> 00:47:12,749
frogman areas nineteen and thirty-seven

1039
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:14,559
homes and also

1040
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:17,579
rodman area twenty in the inferior
temporal region

1041
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:19,940
that seems to be active wet

1042
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,489
people art

1043
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:24,160
involved with oradour seen colored
stimuli

1044
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,289
that is princeton or that have some kind
of

1045
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:30,670
and are what caused wind i've discovered

1046
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:33,359
was that activity in these two

1047
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,240
caller

1048
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,959
areas all of the brain was modulated by
hypnotic suggestion

1049
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:41,899
so that when subject stars showed

1050
00:47:41,899 --> 00:47:45,009
warsaw plug the colored pattern in color

1051
00:47:45,009 --> 00:47:46,920
these areas were active

1052
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,849
when subjects or the colored pattern in
grayscale

1053
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:54,099
activity was diminished in precisely
these areas

1054
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:57,969
when subjects or the gray scale pattern
in grayscale

1055
00:47:57,969 --> 00:48:01,979
there was diminished activity in these
areas cause there is no colour in the

1056
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:02,670
stimulus

1057
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,279
and no colour in the experience

1058
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:08,759
when the subject thought the gray scale
pattern

1059
00:48:08,759 --> 00:48:11,499
they hold loosening of the color

1060
00:48:11,499 --> 00:48:15,579
these brain areas got active uh... that
active again

1061
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:19,479
so what's interesting about this study
as with the rain bill study

1062
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,149
is that you can see

1063
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:23,209
changes in the brain

1064
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:25,190
that correspond to

1065
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,159
the suggestions

1066
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:29,439
ought to be given by the hypnotist

1067
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:33,330
and be experiences the perceptual
experiences

1068
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,089
better be reported

1069
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:37,410
been reported by the subject

1070
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:40,140
okay so there is actually just another
that way you

1071
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:40,880
on them

1072
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,259
presenting that uh...

1073
00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:44,199
kind of data

1074
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:48,619
so what we can do now is to summarize in
the same way as we did for the decisive

1075
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:49,329
disorders

1076
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:51,019
what it is that altered

1077
00:48:51,019 --> 00:48:54,009
in hypnosis as an altered state of
consciousness

1078
00:48:54,009 --> 00:48:55,880
and what alter it is

1079
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,049
conscious awareness

1080
00:48:58,049 --> 00:49:03,409
that the person with automatic and egypt
is not consciously aware of memories

1081
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:04,459
that he's got

1082
00:49:04,459 --> 00:49:09,819
the person with hypnotic blindness or
hypnotic echoes is not consciously aware

1083
00:49:09,819 --> 00:49:12,709
of visual or auditory perception

1084
00:49:12,709 --> 00:49:14,419
what is

1085
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:18,869
impaired by hypnotic suggestion is
explicit memory or explicit

1086
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:20,089
of perception

1087
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:25,349
what spared despite these suggestions is
what we now recognizes implicit memory

1088
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:27,469
or implicit

1089
00:49:27,469 --> 00:49:31,650
implicit reception and again the nice
thing is part that when you can do it

1090
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:34,319
our brain imaging hard shows

1091
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,469
the brain

1092
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:38,569
patter brain activity is changing

1093
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:45,569
in a manner that correlated with these
suggestions and their reports

1094
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:46,810
okay

1095
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:51,830
hysteria and hypnosis or to
psychological alterations in

1096
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:54,370
consciousness i suppose doctor michael

1097
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:55,949
alterations and consciousness

1098
00:49:55,949 --> 00:49:57,359
next week will take up

1099
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:58,410
on a couple more

1100
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,160
with a focus on

1101
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,369
meditation as an altered state of
consciousness and its consequences for

1102
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:04,900
cognition

1103
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,150
and brain activity

1104
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,729
thank you very much

1105
00:50:09,729 --> 00:50:10,319
have a good weekend
