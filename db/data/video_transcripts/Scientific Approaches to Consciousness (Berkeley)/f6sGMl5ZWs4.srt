1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,339
okay let's pick up where we left off
last time

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,730
when we looked into our minds when we
entrust back we find various states of

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,250
consciousness that switching said that
there's no reason to think he's wrong

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,789
about that

5
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:18,539
hadn't

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,960
if you want to make a science out of
this what you want to try to do is to

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,849
trying to figure out

8
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:27,029
how to study these states of
consciousness in some way in the in some

9
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,789
way objectively

10
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:33,079
this was the gold all of the early
nineteenth century scientific psychology

11
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,330
which was oriented around the study of
sensation

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,690
and perception

13
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,460
and spent a lot of time

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,220
in guiding gazed in an enterprise called
cycle physics which i'm going to talk to

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,930
about today

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,339
what that's like a physicist tried to do

17
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,350
was to put

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,150
the kind of introspection bad jamison
fall suffers for centuries before him

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,100
had done

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,160
moral lesson

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,040
formally

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,200
on the some kind of firms scientific
basis

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,190
and what they don't know what what they
decided to do was to start of the very

24
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,420
beginning with the most elementary kinds
of

25
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,650
card conscious experiences you can have

26
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,300
which are sensations

27
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,470
and they decided that ok art

28
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,290
sensations are private

29
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,090
there'd their their states of mind if we
don't have any direct knowledge of them

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,570
but the way to make a science out of
conscious experience

31
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,860
so they thought

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,560
was to try to do

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,520
identify the relations between peoples
conscious experiences

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,390
and these

35
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,880
physical conditions

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,800
that gave rise to those conscious
experiences

37
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,910
so we get psycho physics which tries to
trace the relation between

38
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,329
physical properties and some stimulus

39
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:51,070
something that can be given a third
person objective description

40
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,729
and the psychological properties of the
experience to which that stimulus gives

41
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:01,650
rise something that has columbia sleeper
third purple first-person subjectivity

42
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,180
nyc amicus science out of the first
person subjectivity got tired to

43
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,170
something

44
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,389
and what the psychophysical is one of
the dough

45
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,380
height experience too

46
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,340
stimulation

47
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,189
so they came up with the basic
psychophysical principle

48
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:16,590
palm

49
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,559
which can be summarized basically this
way

50
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:25,089
every psychological quality alba sensory
experience is related to some physical

51
00:02:25,089 --> 00:02:26,849
property of the cars

52
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,059
stimulus okay now that's it that's the
working assumption

53
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:32,279
all volvo cycle physics

54
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:35,169
and what they really are nineteen
century psychophysical is dead was to

55
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:37,579
develop a number of methods

56
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:40,650
that would allow them to trace those
relations

57
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,250
between the qualities of experience

58
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,639
and all

59
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,969
and the yard and and and the
characteristics of various kinds of

60
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:48,879
stimulation

61
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,359
and they did this by the simple
expedient of asking people to assign

62
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:55,480
numbers to their experiences

63
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,540
yet is that really bright light

64
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,829
or is it a very dim light is a very long
we're going through some very soft noise

65
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:03,780
and they simply ask people to

66
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,729
assign numbers

67
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,860
all representing the quality of
cigarettes experiences

68
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,219
and so you can measure mental state in
that

69
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:12,519
funny way

70
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,500
all glad you could also measure the
physical state of the stimulus in that

71
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,280
way that we always do

72
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,760
and then you could kind and see what the
relationship while relationships were

73
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,939
between them

74
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:28,569
a lot of the early cycle physics all was
fault was all focused on all of the ban

75
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:31,269
on the nature of what are known as
thresholds

76
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:34,149
and they're different thresholds for
conscious awareness

77
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:37,669
and the question above threshold is

78
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:38,439
what

79
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,249
cotton what amount of stimulus the
stimulation does it take

80
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:46,689
for someone to be consciously aware
called a stimulus

81
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:47,850
okay so

82
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,030
it's a dark tonight and i'm looking out
over the desert or i'm looking out over

83
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,449
the bay and there's a light out there

84
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:59,289
and how much later is required for me to
be conscious of that fit

85
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:00,789
there's certain white

86
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:02,399
that's not going up

87
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,940
fault of the make up their own through
into consciousness

88
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,560
you brighten the light a little bit it
does become

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,909
onto the conscious

90
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:12,379
so that's what what what's known as the
absolute threshold

91
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:15,349
the amount of although stimulus

92
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:16,850
in the audience tends to be

93
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,959
that is required for that stimulus to be
represented unconscious awareness

94
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,950
and there were also interested in what's
known as the relative threshold

95
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,080
exam idea

96
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,449
but the relative threshold is the amount
of change that's necessary to stimulus

97
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:35,949
for that changed to be consciously
represented

98
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,780
and if you think about it for a second

99
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,010
the absolute threshold is kind of a
special case of the relative threshold

100
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,160
when the good when we're talking about
the absolute threshold

101
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,110
we're talking about really the
difference between something

102
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,110
now the cycle physicians were very
serious about this they thought physics

103
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,000
was the great science

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,729
and that the closer they could come to
physics the bed the more scientific

105
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:01,830
there's psychology would be

106
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,699
all day and so they were very very
interested in

107
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:05,820
trying to devise

108
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,520
what we're going to psychophysical
parallels

109
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,830
that is parallels between the
fundamental although all of the

110
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,129
dimensions of physics

111
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:17,599
and the fundamental dimensions of
psychological experience to remember

112
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,400
this new tony in physics for talk of a
purely

113
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,620
nineteenth-century here

114
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,960
this is before writing stein and all of
his little friends

115
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,699
planned so classical did tony in physics
basically says that there are three

116
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,189
fundamental dimensions

117
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:33,029
mass

118
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,680
space

119
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,539
and time

120
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,379
the cycle physicist said well she you
know is an interesting

121
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:44,240
but there are also fruit our
corresponding three fundamental

122
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,399
dimensions of psychological experience

123
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,100
we can think about

124
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,819
intensity

125
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,080
how much light

126
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,840
how much sound how much smell

127
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,729
as being somehow analogous to mass

128
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:59,870
we can think about extensively distance
how much

129
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,069
mental space something takes up

130
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:06,749
as being part of the somehow an elegance
to to space

131
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:10,090
and pro tends to be hollow long the
experience last

132
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,930
as being analogous to the physical
dimension of time so right there

133
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,750
you've got these nice psychophysical
parallels are not just kind of kept the

134
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,299
psychophysical spelling

135
00:06:19,299 --> 00:06:20,780
pretty quickly however

136
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,209
thus visa early psychologists notice

137
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,449
conscious experiences

138
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:27,240
had at least

139
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,530
dimensions attached to them

140
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,589
that didn't seem to have a

141
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:31,650
physical

142
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,159
counterpart

143
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:37,370
the first of these was called eight ten
city or we would call it vividness

144
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,990
fujian i have a burly vivid image of
something or other vivid perceptive

145
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,639
something

146
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,259
all world or a dim

147
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:46,630
vague fragmentary one

148
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,630
and there didn't seem to be any
corresponding physical dimensions loans

149
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,580
are there

150
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,659
and then there are qualities

151
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:56,939
of sensory experience which will also
talk about at length

152
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:01,030
on this lecture which didn't seem to
have

153
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,220
joanne the kind of uh... into any kind
of physical counterpart

154
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,169
but the idea that intensity extensively
in protest city

155
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:11,750
nap to write on to the are three dollar
dimensions abroad

156
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,529
the fundamental dimensions classical
physics

157
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:15,349
suggested to

158
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,480
the psychophysical said they were on
their on the right track

159
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,829
and trying to connect

160
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:24,069
the physical bulb and uh... and dislike
tickle

161
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,919
most of her lease like a physics was
concerned with a problem with intensity

162
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,940
the strength

163
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,599
of a sensory experience

164
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,209
invision vision science we have a
special name for this is called the

165
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:36,020
brightness

166
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,890
fom or of a_t_r_

167
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,990
of a white or or or a visual sensation
independent audition we have something

168
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,029
called loudness you never say that's a
lot of light

169
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:50,909
on you might say something to break told
but you don't you know same thing

170
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:53,449
alone as when you say there's a bright
light

171
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:55,810
and the psych appears asus argued

172
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,750
the intensity of a sensory experience

173
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,409
or to be related somehow to the amount
of of energy

174
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:04,899
physical energy

175
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:05,599
associated

176
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,829
the stimulus

177
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:09,020
and that the physical

178
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,630
intensity or that the physical energy of
the stimulus

179
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,580
was somehow coated in the nervous system
and gave rise to this continuous

180
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,569
dimension all-volunteer insti

181
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:20,559
now how that's done

182
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:23,710
they were completely sure about that we
now know

183
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,989
that into the intensity of the stimulus

184
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:27,639
is coated in the nervous system

185
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,199
by two principles

186
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,490
a principle of temporal summation of the
principal spatial summation

187
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,300
hi intensity stimuli

188
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,410
lied to

189
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,140
very fast neural firings

190
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,740
okay that's it

191
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,100
somehow the nervous system is able to

192
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,170
on keep track of how fast

193
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,830
under on

194
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,260
is for a ring

195
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,830
all wardrobe rather the frequency of of
liberal and falsehood

196
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,650
that gives rise to

197
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,300
one aspect of intensity

198
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,110
and then special summation

199
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,560
all high-intensity stimuli

200
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,720
palm lead to the firing of lots of ron's
not just one

201
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,550
so that's what special summation is
ordeal nervous system is able to keep

202
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,600
track of that

203
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,230
on angela as well

204
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,980
okay bob the first thing they noticed
was that there wasn't things that we are

205
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,680
not always so morphism

206
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,080
that is a wonder one relationship
between

207
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,230
changes in the physical intensity

208
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,349
although the physical energy associated
with the stimulus

209
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:28,940
and changes in the intensity of the
sensory experience

210
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,920
to which that stimulus or gave rise

211
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,420
the first i did notice this was of the
other guy named vapor

212
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,740
polo who home

213
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,100
looked looked at difference thresholds
that is how much

214
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,710
intensity has to be how much energy has
to be added to a stimulus

215
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,570
before a an observer will detect a
change in intensity

216
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,440
and what he discovered was what's now
come to us as they burst law system

217
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,350
doesn't work

218
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,490
delta are over i will see

219
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,749
the amount to all of

220
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:00,120
change required

221
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,200
to produce a

222
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,560
jost noticeable difference in the
intensity of the stimulus turns out to

223
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,190
be a constant fraction

224
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,280
of that intensity

225
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,600
so if you ritual stimulus is ten units
of or could be that there has been units

226
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,919
of of of energy associated with it

227
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,010
you'll notice a change if you increase

228
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,870
it by save one if

229
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,410
of the risk of a constant is uh... up

230
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,890
or one out one ten

231
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,239
if the original tends to be as one
hundred

232
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,200
then you require ten units

233
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,000
of change before the change will be nice

234
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,080
if the original

235
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,079
all of the intensity is two hundred

236
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,190
you might require on you would require
two hundred

237
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,920
called units of uh... of change and so
there's a lot here

238
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,160
these are these guys are remember
modeling psychology after physics

239
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,730
physics has all sorts of really cool
laws

240
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,370
and our end and they perform you
discovered this this was in fact the

241
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:55,890
first

242
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,570
of the psychological was that was
discovered and that again have suggested

243
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,529
to people

244
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,260
that they were on the right track

245
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,300
now neighbors fraction

246
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:05,940
palm

247
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,040
on delta are you over all right

248
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,480
varies from one load at would be to
another

249
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,800
and varies from one species to another
so that in fact you can use babe ruth

250
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,879
fraction as a kind of universal index of
of sensory acuity

251
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,289
that's good across modalities

252
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:26,730
and across alaska

253
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,090
and across species

254
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:33,560
here are selected palm vapor fractions
for various art aspects of human

255
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,670
sensation

256
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,760
albeit restrictions sociated with visual
brightness is one over sixty

257
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,790
for thermal pane that is

258
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,990
kane or resulting from he'd stimulus
applied to the skin

259
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,039
one over thirty cutaneous pressure
pressure on the skin

260
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,300
on one of seven

261
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,840
uh... feast of salt wonderfully and so
on

262
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,590
and what this means the smaller the
baber fraction no more sensitive

263
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,030
the sensory modality

264
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,699
so here for visual brightness

265
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:06,700
it only takes a one

266
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,550
what what one sixty f

267
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,090
of the original intensity to produce a
just noticeable difference

268
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,840
here for the taste of salted water
you've got a really dump a lot more

269
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,240
sultan

270
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,300
to produce a change uh... vietnam

271
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,559
in intensity so the nice thing about
their burst fraction

272
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,490
is that you could use something like
this uh... pump to

273
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,680
compare all sensory acuity across

274
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,410
sensory modalities and across all uh...

275
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:33,879
species

276
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,010
you can determined vapors fraction for
racks

277
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:41,550
were cats or dogs or anything like that
and you can show that wraps have more

278
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,870
visual acuity than humans do

279
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,570
with that as they have less visual cue
you've been humans do but they have

280
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,130
all more all all factory iqbal acuity
than humans too and so on that soon

281
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,750
that's the idea here

282
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,260
boost our faq nurse

283
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,930
although the following up on guard on
believers fraction called

284
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,020
or by the way

285
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,560
don't get caught up on these formulas
right this is a math class or anything

286
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,769
like that

287
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,819
repugnant using this is an illustration
of what these guys were trying to do to

288
00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:14,580
try to make an objective science
unconscious experience

289
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,620
all the discovered a more general for
all of formulation alba of baber swap

290
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,740
in what's now known as factors walk

291
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,740
as equals k log alright

292
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,840
palm

293
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,440
film over what what factors what
basically says is for every aspect of

294
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,089
one of those sensory experience

295
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:33,930
there is some logarithm

296
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,280
that will all relate

297
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,520
uh... the physical intensity of the
stimulus

298
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,620
sensory intensity that is the
experienced intensity

299
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,820
of the signals

300
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,070
so here if we simply assume that

301
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,610
k is one

302
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,230
and we'd say don't talk about logs for
the base ten

303
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,209
okay here

304
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,300
we've got the stimulus

305
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,680
of no intensity

306
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,949
and there's going to be no sensation

307
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:01,980
because

308
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,300
the log zero zero

309
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,770
we get up here to and intensity

310
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,090
all all

311
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,710
dob ten

312
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,330
uh... sensory intensity of one

313
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,600
you get up here

314
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,000
all physical intensity of one hundred
units

315
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,430
you get the sensory intensity of

316
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,500
two units

317
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,129
you get up here too

318
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,869
called of the stimulus intensity of two
hundred units never mind what the units

319
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:28,850
or there

320
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,550
physical units

321
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,810
on who get a sense rian of intensity of
two point three oh it's it's a very nice

322
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,460
it's a very nice permitted and there's
all lawful relationship

323
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,050
between up this echo god

324
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,349
characteristic of the stimulus

325
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,290
and the psychological characteristics

326
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,800
all the experience

327
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,750
now what what

328
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,740
rockne really liked about this

329
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,540
was it a few plot of this relationship
on the cause of on on semi log paper

330
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,950
you've got a straight line

331
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,010
here we've got

332
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:04,040
logarithmic scale of stimulus intensity
anil ordinary scale of sensory intensity

333
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,450
and you get a sort of the uh... a
straight line like this

334
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,230
and the cycle physicist logged stuff
like this

335
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,640
and the reason i liked it is

336
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,870
there is nothing more beautiful in
science than a straight line

337
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,770
on we've got a straight line you really
think you know something

338
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,710
and here you've got something like

339
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,079
a wonder one

340
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:26,870
correspondence

341
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,379
that's one st one is

342
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:29,880
so inside the something like

343
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,470
an isomorphism

344
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,950
between all of the between physical
stimulation

345
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,790
and uh... and sensory experience

346
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,560
so we get factors law

347
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,329
and if you think about it for a second

348
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:43,790
you want most interesting aspect
effective flaw is that says

349
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,610
that sensation

350
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,410
grows more slowly than stimulation

351
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:55,280
a relatively large change in physical
stimulation produces a new relatively

352
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,000
small change in the hall

353
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,630
we've experienced sensation you can see
that here

354
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,130
where the stimulus

355
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,650
goes fall from

356
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,150
form of promo outpost of the ten units

357
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,140
of two hundred units

358
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,560
physical terms

359
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,740
only doubles

360
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,959
in on the in psychological terms
sensation grows worse wound stimulation

361
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,330
yes

362
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,020
now about this just an example companies
lager rhythm somewhere okay

363
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,270
all they've got got got a list rated
somehow so that's but that's what we do

364
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,320
all by that

365
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,750
lead again it's the shape of the curve

366
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,820
on that uh... that that really matters
here now this is fine fights are really

367
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:40,560
very nice general law that applies and
lotsa lotsa lotsa

368
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,760
of the places

369
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,070
the general ideas of sensation always
grows more slowly than simulation but

370
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,810
it's not always true

371
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,559
also for example the perceived length of
a line

372
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,310
there actually is a wonder one route gov
relationship

373
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,999
on there

374
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:58,900
you add ten units of actual length

375
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,550
opinion a change in perceived length

376
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,110
and they are really really interesting
exception

377
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,060
is for perceived

378
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,899
where you get a little bit of change in
intensity

379
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:10,620
can produce a massive

380
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,829
jolla change in experienced pain

381
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,069
and if you don't believe me the next
time you're at the dentist unease

382
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:22,689
grilling just ask him to press down all
little harder

383
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:25,060
just got these massive things

384
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,730
tucker's lawyers close

385
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,280
but it's not quite right if you're
really doing psycho physics

386
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,130
what you want to do with what i have a
general or that covers all the poor the

387
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,679
whole the possibilities

388
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,830
and we got that from a harvard
psychologist named s smith

389
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,640
stevens

390
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,470
all of those of you who ski

391
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:47,390
stevens brought these shorts dogged the
short downhill ski to america from your

392
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,100
so luxury

393
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:56,100
cool guy or outside of uh... outside of
psychology yep

394
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,550
they asked people to assign numbers
that's called the method of magnitude

395
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,169
estimation

396
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:05,420
so you'd give somebody say you know
wharton ten units scale

397
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,370
or all or or a one hundred unit scale
and u_s_ into assign numbers to their

398
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,020
experience

399
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,840
all all database and the thing is people
can do that

400
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,140
now sometimes on some time to give a
little anchors

401
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,070
so for example and in pain research we
will sometimes are subject to some to

402
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,570
give a fault they uh... value of zero

403
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,380
to absolutely no pain

404
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,690
and the value of tend to

405
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,210
all that as much pain as you can
possibly imagine

406
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,950
but the interesting thing is

407
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,330
yeah you'd think oh jeez that's
objective you know that's remote out

408
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,420
that's appointed subj active right

409
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,410
but what's interesting about it is that
people can do this reliably

410
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,750
and what's even more interesting about
it but gave the cycle physicists hope

411
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,470
whatever numbers people assigned

412
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,390
buried waffle leave with

413
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,950
something that they could keep track of
objectively

414
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,720
because we've got giving rise to things
like factors law unbelievers floor

415
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,580
and uh... and steven swap

416
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,220
this is stephen swap

417
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,360
okay palm

418
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,560
yes ok stevens what s equals chaotic at
the end

419
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,140
and what stephens' law basically says is

420
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,409
for every arcata other aspect of a
number of a sensation

421
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:20,450
there is some exponent

422
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,519
that will relate

423
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,160
the physical

424
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,960
quality of the stimulus too with the
psychological quality of the all out of

425
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,900
the corresponding sensation

426
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,740
here for factors law remember your high
school of high school mathematics

427
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,549
ology dot logs for the basement

428
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:40,600
you got something like an exponent of
one-half

429
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,399
so you're lookin faces square roots

430
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:44,910
and you get something although that
looks very much

431
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,830
like on like like doctors who are

432
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,200
here is

433
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,830
stephens on here is a case of ball
length

434
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,330
and there's the case of pain

435
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,230
where the exponent is actually greater
than one

436
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,780
meaning that

437
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,140
in the case of pain sensation grows more
rapidly

438
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,020
then stimulation

439
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,460
but in any case

440
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,700
derek installment exponent

441
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,310
somewhere that you can determine
incorrectly

442
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,090
double relate

443
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,440
the physical characteristic of a
stimulus

444
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,420
to the psychological characteristics

445
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,530
of the uh...

446
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:22,170
of the uh... uh... of the corresponding
experience

447
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,760
that's what these guys did not stevens
was working and in

448
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,390
said that as late as well

449
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,630
as late as the nineteen sixties and
seventies

450
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,530
uh... but it wasn't this was an
enterprise before that

451
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,140
stevens was the culmination of an
enterprise

452
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,260
that began in the early part of the
nineteenth century

453
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,080
with people trying to uh...

454
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,669
died trying to identify

455
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:43,159
these psychophysical principle

456
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,720
now why my telling of it

457
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,480
i'm telling you this because for my
money anyway

458
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,830
all thought classical cycle physics is
the very first

459
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,960
scientific approach the consciousness

460
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,480
that we have national discourse is
supposed to be all about

461
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,930
these guys were doing empirical studies

462
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,130
followed the rules of science as they
are

463
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,880
as the understood that we are getting
systematic observations not just some

464
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,030
guy sitting down and armchair somewhere
sybil what do i think about watch

465
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,399
you were getting controlled
experimentation

466
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:20,309
they're very carefully appalled above
the selected stimuli

467
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:24,829
are very under applied under very very
cool tightly controlled all of the

468
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:26,020
conditions

469
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,700
u_n_ quantitative data analyses you had
physical measurements of stimuli

470
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,050
you've got things like magnitude
estimations pole vault

471
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,529
of bald of of the people's experiences

472
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:41,070
you get out allies them statistically by
the time these guys really got going

473
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,360
palm of that we've got some mathematical
tools to work but what the correlation

474
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,280
coefficient of that we could use

475
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,270
and on the basis of their work

476
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,880
deride some mathematical function
whether it's expressed in terms of

477
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,690
ratios or a locker rooms or exponents
doesn't really matter for the purposes

478
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,299
of illustration here

479
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:03,210
got some mathematical function

480
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,390
that would relate

481
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,760
aspect of the stimulus environment

482
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,880
psalm aspect of conscious sensory
experience and to the extent that these

483
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,269
guys were able to discover these
psychophysical laws

484
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:17,549
they were able to show

485
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,600
that yes

486
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,700
there are lawyers

487
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,740
wonder why

488
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,100
conscious sensory experience

489
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,710
and we could discover them through the
typical methods of sites that's what's

490
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,910
like the physics was awful about

491
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,760
now as i said before psychophysical
early began with a study of intensity

492
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,360
and thresholds and all of that kind of
stuff

493
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,210
but pretty quickly

494
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,760
sab august of aside because it's moved

495
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,220
to all other aspects of unconscious
experience

496
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,420
your home beyond intensity

497
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,760
the idea was

498
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,900
intensity was that

499
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,120
was a characteristic that was coming to

500
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,440
all modalities

501
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,540
you've got a bright lights were dimmed
lights you could have wild selves are

502
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,810
soft sound to them strong taser strong
smells

503
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,820
were weak of that these smells and
that's fine

504
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,100
but there are also specific

505
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,779
over qualities

506
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:13,010
that palm that that are lucerne specific

507
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:18,580
t_e_c_ modality and um... i'll give you
one instance triton looking at

508
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,340
those psychophysical relationships as
well

509
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,300
so for example in vision

510
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,420
we have a quality that you find no place
else which is hugh essentially the

511
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,030
caller

512
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,820
of the texture of associated with
experts with its red or yellow or green

513
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,570
or blue or whatever

514
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,440
and you have saturation

515
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,720
all which basically is are the bad has
has to do with

516
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,240
hold much weight

517
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,710
latest mixed in

518
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,909
with the color

519
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:48,700
in audition you have a quality of pitch

520
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,309
though you own whether the sound is high
bridge or more woodbridge

521
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:55,260
and you have on camera

522
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,369
all which is kinda like the difference
between all

523
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:03,550
between eighty also flew to the clarinet
player of violin on

524
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,710
and an oval

525
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,869
and the general idea again

526
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:09,290
was that if your recycle bin systems

527
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,390
beer working assumption

528
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,240
each of these qualities sub sensation

529
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,180
is related to some physical
characteristic of the corresponding

530
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:18,870
stimulus

531
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,030
so for example

532
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,330
with respect to cuba

533
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,470
we all know

534
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,770
uh... thought the hw

535
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,460
is related to the wavelength

536
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,320
stimulation

537
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,670
so we've got relatively audit short
wavelengths

538
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,690
on giving rise to things like calm

539
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,830
uh... the experience of blue

540
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,630
and relatively long wavelength giving
rise to the experienced volvo of red and

541
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,369
green and yellow or somewhere in between
there

542
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:45,510
so again

543
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,290
there's eight psychophysical
relationship

544
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,490
something about

545
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:54,030
all of the someone there's some kind of
connection between wavelength and the

546
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,060
experience of q

547
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,190
and saturation i misspoke before it's
not exactly the amount of whites the

548
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,770
amount of great that's added to a
stimulus

549
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,479
this is

550
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:05,120
the same

551
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,169
allred to which i'd that'd a bunch all

552
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:11,400
a bunch of greater that gives you such a
rationing and again

553
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,940
all you can betrays the experience of
the saturation of a color

554
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,669
or and trace it to

555
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:22,009
various physical qualities like the
wavelength of stimulation of the amount

556
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:24,510
of great that's been added

557
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,540
same kind of thing happens with auditory
sensation of your recycle possesses

558
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,520
the pitch of the tone is given argued it
is

559
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,070
from from for their money given by its

560
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,220
frequency so if you think about the
musical scale

561
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,010
you've got caught in the bass clef
second stacey is associated with the

562
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,700
frequency of a hundred thirty one cycles
per second

563
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,900
middle c_ about two hundred sixty two
cycles per second

564
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,760
and third spacing of the trouble cleft
call upon the frequency of about five

565
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,269
hundred twenty three cycles per second

566
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:56,120
modern orchestras to into eighty four
forty

567
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,930
second space say in the trouble club

568
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,790
four hundred and forty cycles per second
so there's a nice psychophysical

569
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,560
relationship

570
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,979
is related to

571
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:06,830
of the two frequency

572
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,950
and a powder

573
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,690
is related to the shape

574
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:14,150
fall beyond all above the underwire wave
of church and see the story my sleep

575
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,780
but here is the characteristic

576
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,510
all the way the sociated with a violin

577
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,700
and a trumpet

578
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,680
a flute

579
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,980
at an old boat

580
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,790
very very very different courage

581
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,580
drug characteristics always really has
to do

582
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,200
with armed with with the number of
harmonics that are being added

583
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,270
but again

584
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:38,009
that quality of auditory sensation seems
to be related directly

585
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:39,390
to uh...

586
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,910
to some physical characteristic of the
corresponding part stimulus

587
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,370
which gave rise

588
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:46,889
palm

589
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:48,600
what's known as

590
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,330
the doc dot dot gov a set of physical

591
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,590
on the physiological principles

592
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,630
enshrined in

593
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,250
are what's known as the doctrine of
specific fiber energy

594
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,179
you'll remember for the last lecture

595
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:05,999
that johannes miller had argued that the
modality of sensation each different

596
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,450
modality of sensation vision hearing or
faction gah station

597
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,490
was associated with the different

598
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,620
neural systems

599
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,260
followed miller's student hermann von
helmholtz

600
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,490
although the basically articulated an
extension of miller's doctrine

601
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:27,080
that bit that said that that's true for
each quality of sensation

602
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,179
within

603
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,880
eight sensory modality

604
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,010
so are for example hw

605
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,920
home

606
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,000
you'd you'd assume that

607
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,610
to some extent or another

608
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,190
different hues are associated with
different rural

609
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,740
uh... amid different girls systems

610
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,550
uh... different pitches are associated
with different systems i mean fact we

611
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,340
know that something like that

612
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,360
uh... is on

613
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,030
is no troop

614
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,960
so that's basically where the
psychophysical scotus

615
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,039
they spent a great deal of time

616
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:01,820
trying to trace the the empirical
associations

617
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,519
between

618
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,790
these psychological qualities of various

619
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,280
sensory experiences

620
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,980
and the physical stimuli

621
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,970
that hong that gave rise

622
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:16,450
for those experiences and in that way
gave us our first scientific approach

623
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,440
to consciousness

624
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,419
the second tendency here onto the the
second trendy and get it in the in this

625
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:25,440
early work

626
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,570
is a job

627
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,850
discourse psychology that was known as
structural ism

628
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:34,950
which focused its attention mostly on
these different

629
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,520
modalities specific

630
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,730
qualities of sensation

631
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,200
and structural subsoil bill helped
villains who was the first one is

632
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,210
sometimes thought of as the father of
psychology

633
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,520
uh... and this is his american student
t_v_ preacher who founded the

634
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,160
psychological laboratory so

635
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,300
the idea that the structural aside

636
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,160
was to engage in a kind of

637
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,590
mental chemistry the cycle physicist
want to do a mental physics

638
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,409
they wanted to connect mental life too

639
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:09,169
thode to the physical world

640
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:10,340
and the structural us

641
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,740
were really more inspired by chemistry

642
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,559
than anything else and they are all of
the they've become work from a more or

643
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,340
less simple analogy

644
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,639
which was to say

645
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:24,799
let's think about conscious experiences
those complex things that we experience

646
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,160
for me

647
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,700
c_e_o_s

648
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:32,460
car running into a tree and telegraph
avenue or whatever it is worth watching

649
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,950
and i don't think i'll misconduct
analogous to molecules

650
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,130
and we now know

651
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,590
they knew them

652
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,389
harvest was made that member based on
nineteen th century home

653
00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:42,690
uh... the chemistry dept

654
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:48,049
we can break molecules down into their
constituent or arvind adams

655
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:49,750
and in the same way

656
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,049
what the structure was one to try to do

657
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:54,020
was too

658
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,799
stark

659
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,810

660
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,460
analyze complex conscious experiences

661
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,890
into

662
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,260
your reducible

663
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,929
elements sever somehow analogous to
vittu to adams

664
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,720
also of them

665
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,290
what these elements worker with a lot of
debate among the structure with the and

666
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,820
fistfights at their meetings about this

667
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,900
everybody agreed that

668
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,980
uh... there were these element that
there were some elementary sensations

669
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,539
follow but some people argued that there
were some elementary feelings that work

670
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:26,870
uh... that that you could detect in
these complex

671
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,770
our mental uh...

672
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,460
or the but with britain

673
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,559
and others argue that there were also
memory images so when you had a sensory

674
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,480
experience

675
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,770
cold certain

676
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,860
thoughts to mine uh... as well

677
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,610
both ways

678
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,200
the cycle possesses

679
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:49,200
focused and sensations and that's where
we're going to focus yes quick

680
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,170
i think that that's what this is right

681
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:59,309
the looks like a physics and structural
is on our intends to analyze quality of

682
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:02,070
scientifically that's why he introduced
his lectures with quality that they're

683
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,010
trying to correct

684
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,360
what the quali apart

685
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,260
i'm lookin out here about this whole
thing

686
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:13,409
complex visual although the heart of the
array and i want to analyze that

687
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:14,749
into various

688
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:16,140
quality up

689
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,809
can't be analyzed any further

690
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:21,100
one of the but what what are the basic
dimensions

691
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,970
so uh...

692
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,600
combat beyond the structural stability
whole bunch of techniques for doing this

693
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,739
so called known as experimental all

694
00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:30,750
introspection

695
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,490
or which have a lot of rules

696
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,909
all uh... associated with it

697
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:37,210
but the basic rule was

698
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:41,740
make what they called the stimulus error

699
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,210
these though the stimulus error was the
error rome

700
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,110
describing the stimulus

701
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,870
instead of describing your experience

702
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,600
now that's not an easy distinction to
make

703
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,670
okay not really did think about it

704
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,430
but they tried really hard

705
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,200
hard to keep

706
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,679
inferences out of the process

707
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:01,570
and ask them to

708
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:06,990
uh... to uh... does a good to describe
what their direct on mediated

709
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,140
uh... experiences operates objects
ballpark

710
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,980
here's an example

711
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,580
so harm

712
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,060
here's what's known you know inundate
vision sciences color circle

713
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,100
on their whole bunch of callers on a
deep in their if i ask you to look up

714
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,339
say between

715
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:28,330
no twelve o'clock at one o'clock and i
ask you what do you see

716
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,059
or what republicans as well as trying to
see

717
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:37,010
you know by privacy some green and i
kind of cc yellow and if i ask you one

718
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,960
on off

719
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,800
what you see

720
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,000
down here around four or five o'clock

721
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,090
see some red nyc's yellow

722
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,400
over here

723
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,809
of around seven or eight o'clock what
you'll see why are our season read they

724
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:54,840
said that states that kind of analysis
into something else

725
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,650
that uh... that the structure was for
trying to well

726
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,650
we're trying to figure out

727
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,780
as a result of these kinds all booked
under of investigations

728
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,150
they identified what they believe to be

729
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:12,300
on the basic home the the basic adams
appalled

730
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:18,230
herzegovina visual experience of hw so
we get from young and helmholtz

731
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:22,179
or what's known as the try chromatic
pedal of the theory of color perception

732
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:24,280
which was basically the discovery

733
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,690
or so they thought

734
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:30,420
that all visible colors can be produced
by a mixture of just three colors

735
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,530
fall of the the red

736
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,499
green and blue

737
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:35,520
and as i described as ideal of

738
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,120
uh... when about people really were the
sweatshirt

739
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,919
those

740
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:41,640
on three primary colors

741
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,899
or or they'll reach associated with
different kinds of

742
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:49,300
of wavelength robert reich dramatically
returns ought to be wrong

743
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,950
and it's replaced by what's known as the
opponent process theory of color vision

744
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,550
were not going to get into that

745
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,980
that's for a sensory

746
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,429
uh... psychology recent three physiology
course

747
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:02,639
that the probe for the purposes of this
lecture

748
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:04,440
the point is

749
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,799
what young and helmholtz and for that
matter

750
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,009
hearing the part of the and others did

751
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:11,859
was to take

752
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:12,960
all the colors

753
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,280
that you could possibly experience
millions and millions of colors to be

754
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,369
don't believe you go into a paint store
sometime

755
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:25,250
and all of those colors can be produced
can be analyzed into

756
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,659
song mixture ald joyous three or so or
the primary of the primary colors

757
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,889
those three colors

758
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:34,240
green and blue

759
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,800
then become for the structural issues

760
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,899
the basic qualities

761
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:41,679
of the experience of color there the
quality

762
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,159
doubly bubble comport

763
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,829
on you can't get uh...

764
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:51,749
you can't get their own road really
really further on the further than that

765
00:34:51,749 --> 00:34:57,079
are more recently altered the james
cutting who's a psychologist at the home

766
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:59,939
that uh... that at cornell

767
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:01,260
has argued that

768
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,889
the analysis of primary colors

769
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:06,260
or give them to a concert is on mult

770
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,630
for the determination of elementary
sensory quali a in the other modalities

771
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,039
part as well and he says if you can do
you think you've got

772
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:18,280
irreducible on analyze little

773
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,440
one of these qualities of experience

774
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,410
they're probably has to

775
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,509
behave

776
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:25,089
the primary colors do

777
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:27,440
uh... the so for example

778
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
you want to be able to have a situation
where

779
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,109
the physical mixture of your primary
quali a

780
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:37,369
can wield all the other qualities that
we know that we can get purple lot of

781
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:41,589
red and blue you can get orange out of
red and part of the yellow

782
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:42,999
and so on

783
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:45,789
are cut it also large is that these
quali o

784
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:47,320
once you've identified one

785
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,480
there ought to be what he calls

786
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,929
physiological atonement

787
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:52,390
there ought to be

788
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,829
following helmholtz is extension of the
doctrine of specific nerve energies

789
00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:01,009
there ought to be on unique neural
pathway for each of these primary

790
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:04,150
qualities that we know that that's the
case for example

791
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:07,469
one of the reasons people like to try
chromatic theory of color vision isn't

792
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:11,599
it turned out that there were three
times a broads open three kinds of

793
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,619
problems with the rest of the aisle

794
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:16,930
one that's really sensitive to long
wavelengths

795
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:21,130
and wondered really sensitive to short
wave lengths and won this really

796
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,039
sensitive to medium wavelengths so you
get red green and blue

797
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,729
add up at the at the physiological level
it's about ought to be the case

798
00:36:28,729 --> 00:36:32,889
for all for although quali a

799
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:35,119
then all the cutting or argues

800
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,950
that if you really got an elementary
quality of experience that is probably

801
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,490
expressed in language

802
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,280
in august eighth the descriptor for that

803
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,980
is probably

804
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,890
model like scenic that is that there's a
single word

805
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,339
okay like red

806
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:55,449
for green or blue

807
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:58,490
that the that expresses our quality

808
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:01,769
and if you look at frequency abusive
language

809
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:06,640
that word ought to be associated with
very high uh... frequency alvo

810
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,339
uh... abuse

811
00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:10,290
moreover

812
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,940
cutting argues careers

813
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,640
really interesting psychologist whose is
interested in sociology and anthropology

814
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,689
of citizens psychology and uh... and
uh... and physiology

815
00:37:19,689 --> 00:37:21,440
he argues that

816
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,890
alm part of the century quali a if you
really got one if you really identified

817
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,599
one it ought to constitute

818
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,720
a basic categories all four oh four or
perception

819
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,089
it ought to be applicable and called it
the most languages

820
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:37,199
and so for example we know

821
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,969
that all languages if they had any color
terms at all they've got

822
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,199
at the very least black and white

823
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:46,999
or dark

824
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:51,779
then fearful language has more than two
color terms the next caller terms turn

825
00:37:51,779 --> 00:37:56,700
out to be some combination of red

826
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,319
quite interesting call a cultural
phenomena

827
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,799
and then doll later on after the
language adds other turns that vote that

828
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:06,929
they will add part of the terms like
gradient pain can orange and purple and

829
00:38:06,929 --> 00:38:07,819
brown

830
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,080
but basically

831
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,269
red yellow green and blue

832
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:12,709
part for all of

833
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:17,619
of represent or or words of almost
everyone which that has home

834
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:21,049
have has a colorful february

835
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,779
there are some exceptions

836
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:25,539
almost everyone as that

837
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:29,339
and then all quietly auger cuttings
applicable let's look at the other bala

838
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:30,650
g these words

839
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,089
think about

840
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:33,049
and green

841
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:33,920
and blue

842
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,839
and yellow

843
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:36,709
and black

844
00:38:36,709 --> 00:38:40,549
these words don't refer to any object

845
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:43,200
they just refer dot color

846
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,539
whereas

847
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:49,029
colour words that we have like orange
and violet

848
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:51,370
and uh... and uh... kind all over

849
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,199
our terms of our borrowed from objects

850
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:58,439
so one hard but what does doug collins
arguing is that we've got the basic

851
00:38:58,439 --> 00:38:59,960
quality of sensation

852
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,779
it should be something that doesn't
refer to any object

853
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:04,449
okay so it's not

854
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:07,670
from the object itself it's a word that
has the day

855
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,519
that describes the experience

856
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,329
so here cutting is actually plane like a
structural uske isn't a structure was

857
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:17,709
all but he said why could if you want to
be used

858
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:18,889
colored vision

859
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:22,990
as you're a model for how would two on
covered the basic

860
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,639
quali are all that conscious experience

861
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:28,719
the basic elements of color conscious
experience

862
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,569
here's how you might go about own doing
it

863
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:36,019
now this enterprise has actually been
done in order ordered or dividends has

864
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:37,669
been no of

865
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:38,489
pursued

866
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:42,759
it all other sensor modalities as well
let me give you just a quick

867
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:44,179
uh... for

868
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:45,809
through world through this

869
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:49,729
so of a danish psychologist named

870
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:51,520
on identified of

871
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,009
four basic qualities of gospel tory or
experience

872
00:39:56,009 --> 00:39:57,229
sweet so our

873
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,539
salty and better

874
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:01,990
all according to headings theory

875
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,680
all of the various things we can taste

876
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,929
difference between

877
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:11,069
justin and fish between oregano and our
time uh... between uh... oh

878
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:13,049
also opened up for whatever

879
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:15,900
all these appalled but with all these
different experiences

880
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,729
are composed of

881
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:18,549
four

882
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:19,410
trusted tori

883
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:20,829
all qualities

884
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:22,359
sweets are work salty

885
00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:23,539
and better

886
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:25,989
i mean actually produce what's known as

887
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:27,769
hemmings

888
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:29,619
tetrahedron

889
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:30,199
all

890
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,289
in which he

891
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:32,269
locates

892
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:37,400
these are qualities at the apex is all
about three-dimensional of them figure

893
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,239
and the general idea is

894
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,310
every

895
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,200
discernible

896
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,559
taste

897
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:45,009
can be

898
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,199
geometrically located

899
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:49,509
as a point in this space

900
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:50,179
every

901
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:53,249
taste the weakened that that that we
could distinguish

902
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:57,269
some degree of sour to some degree of
salt in the some degree of bitterness in

903
00:40:57,269 --> 00:40:58,640
some degree of sweetness

904
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,349
and if you just kind of why in those up

905
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:04,140
on you get a point and that's oregano

906
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,439
and there's going to be another point

907
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:07,000
time

908
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,789
and there's going to be another

909
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:09,759
that's savory

910
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:12,490
and that's what the differences are but
all those days

911
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,229
are composed of these

912
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:16,489
for elementary qualities

913
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:18,859
very nice

914
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:22,109
there are four elementary qualities

915
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:26,399
what you would what comes out of
introspection depends on what people

916
00:41:26,399 --> 00:41:28,829
intro specter on

917
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:33,589
so what happened did was to have people
taste a lot of foods

918
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:34,489
with all due respect

919
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:39,019
he was danish they didn't have a lot of
japanese food there

920
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:40,789
when we come back

921
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,260
all be discovered that there is yet up
fifth

922
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,609
taste quality what's known known as a
mommy

923
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:51,389
all which is kind of the paystubs
voiceless hong

924
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:51,920
didn't

925
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,460
dead people just hadn't noticed

926
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,049
uh... before so what we need is
something new with pending spacecraft

927
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:58,720
tetrahedron

928
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,620
that's got

929
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,710
five pay taxes

930
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,130
uh... to it

931
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,179
somebody who's better if you have a tree
that neither are your hanging might be

932
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:07,400
able to figure out how to do that

933
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,119
palm

934
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:11,799
but that saw the ah... that that's the
general idea

935
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:16,170
all what happened was we discovered to
mommy as a basic case

936
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,290
precisely because we expanded

937
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,890
the numbers the the the the range of
stimuli that the observers were working

938
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,809
on

939
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:25,380
all and so what there's something here
that's

940
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,380
knots weaver not salty or not so we're
not bitter it's something else

941
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:29,950
savory

942
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,449
who bought me

943
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:32,130
called and

944
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,410
now we've now we've

945
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:37,989
understand that there were five basic
qualities augusta tory experience

946
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:42,089
you could do the same thing for all
factory experience henning did this

947
00:42:42,089 --> 00:42:45,009
and identified

948
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:49,130
qualities of also mails everything we
can smell

949
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,710
can be boiled down to

950
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,190
some combination of

951
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,799
spicy those frequencies theory ality

952
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:58,069
of putrid and burned

953
00:42:58,069 --> 00:43:00,680
and again we get pending the smell prism

954
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,429
each of these qualities located and the
home

955
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:06,000
video of the vertex

956
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,429
and you ought to be able to want to
locate

957
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:10,329
individual

958
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:14,839
smell leeches individual thing you but
you can smell at some point

959
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:16,150
inside poem

960
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:20,349
inside the space

961
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:24,650
all it just told me bong

962
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:25,910
mega will put note here

963
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:30,309
there are some smells we can't smell

964
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:33,089
there are all factory

965
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:33,940
stimuli

966
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,079
that lead to behavioral

967
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,049
changes

968
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:41,599
all of that don't give rise to conscious
experience came to bring no visas for

969
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,069
ramones

970
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:47,519
or a alright and we now have old list of
ceremonies that uh...

971
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,179
that better direct but so that's that's
not the case

972
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:54,459
get miss the footnote to stop it's not
the case of all

973
00:43:54,459 --> 00:43:55,519
gospel tori

974
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,189
though lol factory stimuli give rise to
all factor experience

975
00:43:59,189 --> 00:44:00,269
both we'd

976
00:44:00,269 --> 00:44:05,199
usually can't all or not consciously
aware of these weaken

977
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,139
understand that they exist to try to
understand and try to identify them

978
00:44:09,139 --> 00:44:09,969
physiologically

979
00:44:09,969 --> 00:44:13,079
just by their effects

980
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,959
behavior

981
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:20,219
without a question

982
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:23,499
i have to know enough people are looking
for six taste and i haven't found one

983
00:44:23,499 --> 00:44:30,499
yet

984
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:33,919
or you don't know that's where this came
from that's where the that that that's

985
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:38,129
where this came from his own hold whole
institutes of olfactory science

986
00:44:38,129 --> 00:44:41,349
mostly supported by the perfume industry

987
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:43,299
this is true

988
00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:45,429
alm and

989
00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:49,739
on they spend a tremendous amount of
money trying to identify with the

990
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:51,839
specifics or cause i want to

991
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:58,839
rhythm x on new world new sense

992
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:04,280
we have lots and lots of different smell
receptors that and on

993
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,920
mapping these basic smells on tools
receptors is up

994
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,509
process that has not been completed
let's put it that way

995
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:13,109
on thinking what a sport

996
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:15,239
we met with we think

997
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:18,099
we know that there are

998
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:21,259
four five different

999
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:24,479
structurally different taste buds each
of which are sensitive to certain

1000
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:26,509
common combinations of chemicals

1001
00:45:26,509 --> 00:45:32,299
so again if you think about

1002
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:37,299
criterion for a quali a you ought to be
able to find physiological atonement

1003
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:38,590
all but

1004
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:41,140
disappointed all make again a couple
times in the scores

1005
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,439
that psychology has to be right

1006
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:45,880
four you can find me

1007
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,410
before you can do the physiology

1008
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,059
if there are

1009
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:51,259
six

1010
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:52,599
all voters

1011
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:56,180
then you know to start looking for six
basic

1012
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:00,200
pays clubs or something like that dot
over about avilable order receptors in

1013
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,070
the nose

1014
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,770
but until you've identified the basic
qualities

1015
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,380
it's not at all clear

1016
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,369
that uh... that you can do that

1017
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:10,589
now yeah we may have three hundred
different kinds of

1018
00:46:10,589 --> 00:46:12,279
receptors in the nose

1019
00:46:12,279 --> 00:46:16,609
that's too many quality of

1020
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:20,190
people would reject the idea that we
have three hundred different quali o

1021
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,719
all depends investors too cumbersome

1022
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,039
they all want to get things

1023
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:26,229
to alum

1024
00:46:26,229 --> 00:46:28,270
as uh... few dimensions

1025
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:28,970
as possible

1026
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:33,419
i don't do this work i'm not going to
defend it pisses what

1027
00:46:33,419 --> 00:46:35,509
but this is an example

1028
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:42,509
how people have tried to sab to study
conscious experience scientifically

1029
00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:44,520
that we start out with quality of

1030
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,020
trying to figure out what the basic
dimensions are of various sensory

1031
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,900
experiences

1032
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,799
from a static experiences were quite
hard and would you boring

1033
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:57,069
hong kong told also at harvard

1034
00:46:57,069 --> 00:47:00,789
who are identified job of

1035
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:01,589
refunded

1036
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:07,169
home roughly four different quality of
quality or in armed

1037
00:47:07,169 --> 00:47:09,359
tactile sensation

1038
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,719
just whether there is of torture not

1039
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,649
warrington cold is not a single formals
oracle quality

1040
00:47:16,649 --> 00:47:18,389
on turns out that

1041
00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:22,670
you can have warm warmth and cold are
very separately

1042
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:27,169
and then there's some debate about
roughness on and all and wetness

1043
00:47:27,169 --> 00:47:29,959
uh... for that as well

1044
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:32,539
maureen was a student to bb kitchener

1045
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:34,090
and picture of self

1046
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,420
tried to create a touch

1047
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,010
pyramid

1048
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:41,420
somehow analogous to hemmings taste
tetrahedron and smell prism

1049
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,499
where you'd have

1050
00:47:42,499 --> 00:47:44,240
these basic qualities

1051
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,289
of tactile sensation

1052
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:50,069
or arrayed and any different kind of
proj

1053
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:53,589
uh... could be located montana as a as a
point

1054
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:56,119
in between

1055
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:58,979
the idea behind

1056
00:47:58,979 --> 00:48:01,509
scientific investigation of quality a

1057
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:07,029
to try to use psychophysical methods

1058
00:48:07,029 --> 00:48:07,690
varying

1059
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:10,450
the physical qualities of stimuli

1060
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:15,030
measuring process re experiences which
those stimuli we ordered give rise and

1061
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:19,419
then trying to add a lawyer's called
that these things into

1062
00:48:19,419 --> 00:48:21,430
called for the into their basic cover

1063
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:24,150
into their basic elements

1064
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,999
okay can even do it about two minutes
here you can even do that with feeling

1065
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:29,709
won't do this

1066
00:48:29,709 --> 00:48:32,859
fall the different emotional states that
we can have

1067
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:33,779
home

1068
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:35,449
solved when two argued

1069
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:39,409
could be decomposed into just three
different dimensions

1070
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:43,069
plasmids the persons on plasmids

1071
00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:43,649
excitement

1072
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:44,730
versus com

1073
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:46,309
and then what he called

1074
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:48,089
strain versus relax ation

1075
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:50,829
so the the difference between

1076
00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:51,389
disgusted

1077
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:56,029
fear in anger enjoy in happiness n

1078
00:48:56,029 --> 00:48:58,499
various kinds of pleasures and uh... and
uh...

1079
00:48:58,499 --> 00:49:00,229
and on pleasures

1080
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:03,570
you want to be able to locate each of
those experiences

1081
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,249
as a point

1082
00:49:05,249 --> 00:49:07,719
three-dimensional space

1083
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:08,699
according to blend

1084
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:11,390
anyway these were the three

1085
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,390
fundamental dimensions

1086
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,989
all of our

1087
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:16,430
emotional experiences

1088
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:21,940
were arrayed

1089
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,559
what structural is almost like a bizarre
cst dead

1090
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:26,450
was they

1091
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:27,470
tried to give us

1092
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:30,499
or first scientific approach the
consciousness

1093
00:49:30,499 --> 00:49:33,969
are what's interesting to bs guys didn't
write a build-up of understanding of

1094
00:49:33,969 --> 00:49:36,950
consciousness from promo studies of
uh...

1095
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:41,069
all volvo or the other kinds of uh...
psychological phenomena

1096
00:49:41,069 --> 00:49:42,459
they tried to

1097
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:44,799
address consciousness directly

1098
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:47,580
do you have to structure was what he was
interested in he'd say

1099
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,249
i'm interested in consciousness

1100
00:49:49,249 --> 00:49:51,969
you would say i'm interested in
sensation her memory or something like

1101
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:53,959
that so not because of consciousness

1102
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:55,349
they tried to

1103
00:49:55,349 --> 00:49:56,920
to tie

1104
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,569
subjective conscious experiences

1105
00:49:58,569 --> 00:50:01,679
to publicly observable aventis

1106
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:06,669
and i'm in the process all form the
basis for what we now think of sensory

1107
00:50:06,669 --> 00:50:08,599
girl's life

1108
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:11,720
structural ism had its problems these
guys got in debt

1109
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,579
endless

1110
00:50:12,579 --> 00:50:14,499
fruitless debates about

1111
00:50:14,499 --> 00:50:16,439
you know how many

1112
00:50:16,439 --> 00:50:19,049
they're very different qualities there
might be

1113
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:22,180
and our as i've gone suggested to my
very first lecture

1114
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,930
pretty quickly the whole enterprise was
overthrown

1115
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:29,309
by the behaviorist revolution when
people like john b watson said i can't

1116
00:50:29,309 --> 00:50:31,829
take it anymore

1117
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:34,939
we're never going to get anywhere with
this science as long as we try to make

1118
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:36,870
the science of something private

1119
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,690
so now let's turn

1120
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:44,539
psychology from the science of mental
life into a science volvo

1121
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:46,289
of behavior

1122
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:48,289
there was a start

1123
00:50:48,289 --> 00:50:51,109
picking up most of the nineteenth
century a little bit of the twentieth

1124
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:53,159
century as well

1125
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:57,089
the next scientific approach the
consciousness begins with

1126
00:50:57,089 --> 00:50:59,769
that we've got this begins again looked
a cart

1127
00:50:59,769 --> 00:51:04,369
and tries to understand the relationship
between the mind and the body

1128
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:07,549
and that for meeting with

1129
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:09,579
thank you very much weekend
