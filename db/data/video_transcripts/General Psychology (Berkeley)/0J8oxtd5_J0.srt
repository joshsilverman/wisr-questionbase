1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,579
okay last time we left off in our
discussion all val principles of memory

2
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,679
this

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,999
principal in a systematic process in
principle

4
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:19,640
which has to do with the relation
between

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,269
our memory for a particular investments
on the right hand

6
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,299
and i'm not going to check out the world
in general on the other hand

7
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:31,500
and the general idea here is

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,040
that memory for

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,530
things in particular

10
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,490
depends on its run the relationship
between those things and what we know

11
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,960
in general and terms of our knowledge
expectations and beliefs

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,400
so for example

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,540
turns out that they are two different
classes these

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,370
that govern divert the alcohol be a
factor

15
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,110
memories come out of general frameworks

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,440
arms are no on memory

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,269
first is

18
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:01,950
that schematic on driving behaviors

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,030
baha'i dividends that are consistent
with our expectations

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,619
said well in

21
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:10,759
terms of everything that's about the
world

22
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:14,340
they are very easily in colorado

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,630
for that is

24
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,080
douglas came out

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,570
wrapper to schema

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,350
provides a framework that what you can
understand what's going on

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,850
and fit those events rates are right in

28
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,170
at the same token schematic in camera
and events are difficult to encode

29
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,399
precisely because they don't fit with
your expectations they don't conform

30
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:36,860
with your general believes

31
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,270
you have to think about them for a while

32
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,539
so in working for him and they just
email provides

33
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:45,380
a kind of organizational framework

34
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,700
weird some events schema concord events
are factored in memory

35
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,640
in another way

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,120
this game of provides a kind of

37
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,650
background for elaboration

38
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,080
well you have to explain to yourself
wide ischemic in congruent event

39
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,890
occurred and they're very act-up
explaining the event

40
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,119
all leads to a more elaborate

41
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,250
trace a memory

42
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,929
leads to better memory for the event
later

43
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,919
schematic violent behaviors

44
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,089
don't get either benefit they're not
schema conduit so they don't get all

45
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:20,820
happy office allocated processing at the
time of encoding

46
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,060
and they're not schema incongruity

47
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,640
so that they don't get the benefit of
this extra forms of elaborate of

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,469
activity

49
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:31,569
said like and what we can do is we can
expand

50
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,279
does come at a crisis in principle
little bit

51
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,670
to be more precise

52
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,390
about the facts out

53
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,379
buddy exact relationship

54
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,430
between the event and pre-existing
schemata

55
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,870
we said already that memories of
function of the relationship between the

56
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,709
benton pre-existing sca model

57
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,409
the first thing is whether the event is
schema relevant

58
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,629
or a schematic irrelevant

59
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:55,439
does the event

60
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,529
there on the schema in any way

61
00:02:57,529 --> 00:03:01,129
and if so that event is going to be
better remembered

62
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:02,640
then one that doesn't

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,809
bear on the schema

64
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,720
and the second part of the second
distinction that's important

65
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,040
there to raise them but you can be
relevant to a skimmer

66
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,660
if you need to be conned runs with the
schema

67
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,479
or you can be in congruent with the
schema and it turns out

68
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,040
just as an empirical fact

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,370
the schema in congruent events

70
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,870
tend to be remembered better

71
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,759
than schema cargo and events

72
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:27,199
the u_n_ expected

73
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,789
more processing

74
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:30,710
and all and is better off

75
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,469
better remember

76
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:34,150
so so far

77
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:40,100
we've discussed on member all principles
of memory that cover the encoding

78
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,919
the storage and the retrieval stage of
memory processing

79
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,720
and what i want you to see here

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,120
is up all of these principles so far

81
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,309
reflect what you might call that library
metaphor of memory

82
00:03:55,309 --> 00:04:00,549
that is the idea that our memories are
stored houses of marriage

83
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:01,669
and you

84
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:06,379
put knowledge into memory the same what
do you put a book in the library

85
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,129
dot now which remains stranded in memory

86
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:13,620
the same way of book remains stored on
the library shelf

87
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,580
and then you want the information that's
contained in memory

88
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,410
you retrieved some piece of information

89
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,699
in the same way

90
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:21,920
that you would

91
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,800
or or that checker book out of the
library

92
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,430
this library metaphor for memory

93
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:34,639
has been around since roughly the time
of aristotle and it is not a bad way to

94
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,169
think about on the other of about memory

95
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:43,360
notion although memories information
that's in korea did

96
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,229
storied and retrieved when you want to
use it

97
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:48,230
all

98
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,060
it's not the whole story

99
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,220
and the reason it's not the whole story

100
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,850
is that there are other interesting
things that go along besides alm besides

101
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,400
storing

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,719
and retrieving information enough in
memory

103
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,649
but ever since i've been how's this
laundry metaphor for memory has

104
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:10,479
dominated the way we think about all of
about the phenomenon

105
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,090
and the general idea here

106
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,089
remembering

107
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:18,759
takes a former reproducing sale or rent
in the mind

108
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,589
and colleen

109
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:24,299
information in memory makes available
for use later

110
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:25,770
retrieval process these

111
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,809
dana access

112
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,720
to encoded knowledge

113
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,129
and so there are basically to mechanisms
for forgetting

114
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:35,289
that are relevant to us

115
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:39,330
you forget something if u_n_ coated at
poorly to begin with or maybe you didn't

116
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,610
even uncoated

117
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,559
are at all

118
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:43,360
codeine

119
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,479
makes

120
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,020
information unavailable in memory

121
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,550
by the same token

122
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,400
poor retrieval

123
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,779
makes

124
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,320
available information inaccessible

125
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,840
these are the two main mechanisms of
forgetting

126
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,600
when we think about the library of
metaphor of memory

127
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,960
in the same way you go to the library
and say i want to get this book out

128
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,939
and then iris is what we never bought
that book

129
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,490
not that encode it

130
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,180
or the library and says well we bought
that book a long time ago but somebody

131
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,589
stole it and we haven't had the money to
replace its a list of laws from storage

132
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:23,430
or as sometimes happens on a book just
gets miss florio

133
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,100
and you can't even though it's in the
library someplace the only way you'd

134
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,570
ever financed by going shelf by shelf by
shelf by room by room by room to the

135
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,280
library

136
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,080
of very arduous process

137
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,090
to try to find it

138
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,600
unenglish psychologist named frederick c
bartlett objected to the idea of how its

139
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,419
view of memory as a matter of
reproducing knowledge about events

140
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:52,299
and he said look im go something wrong
with the way we study memories bidders

141
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,249
back nineteen-thirties

142
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:56,849
are going to be even with very very
early on

143
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,059
so there's something to the problem with
the way we've traditionally study memory

144
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:02,190
the weight of the house studied memory

145
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,029
is that

146
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:06,500
wheat we try to ask subjects

147
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,960
remember things that don't matter to
them very much

148
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,860
things that are disconnected

149
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,020
things that aren't necessarily
particularly meaningful

150
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,610
and when we do that we get a distorted
the image of how hong of how long the

151
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,889
memory works

152
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,160
ambient house basically construed

153
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,860
memory thought is analogous to remember
in a grocery list you know when you're

154
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,680
company go in the grocery store without
a ruthless to try to remember all the

155
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,740
things you

156
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,210
you want to buy

157
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,309
whereas bartlett said

158
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:41,739
remember it is more like storytelling
when we remember events

159
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:44,760
we tell stories about these events to
ourselves

160
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,389
will re remember offense to somebody
else in some ways as how was your day

161
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:49,710
what'd you do today

162
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,929
you tell the story about your day you
don't say read the book

163
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:58,550
went office

164
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,889
keyboard

165
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,320
you know i don't do that is are well you
know i went and i

166
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,090
check my email another handle time on my
hand so i look at this chapter in this

167
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,210
book and then this person came in

168
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,419
there's a kind of conduct or direct
connectivity to it

169
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:13,600
that really is very important so what

170
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,560
while it did

171
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,679
was is that ok

172
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:17,860
we're going to have a new way to study
in memory

173
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:24,710
if we think that of remembering is like
telling a story then let's study apollo

174
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,189
remember stories

175
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:29,610
and what he did was to all

176
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,069
develop a set of procedures

177
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:31,649
in which

178
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:35,029
he would ask if you've got to tell a
story to a subjects

179
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:38,670
and then either ask them to tell the
story back to him

180
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,040
and they do that

181
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,579
several different on several different
occasions

182
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:46,290
what i would call the method of repeated
reproduction

183
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,280
or where subjects would repeat the story
back to him

184
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,009
once and then again a couple days later
in a couple a couple days later

185
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:54,970
or more interestingly

186
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,000
although erlich invented one salt what's
now known as the method of serial

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,470
reproduction

188
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,039
it's kinda like the telephone game that
you probably have played it

189
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:07,430
parties specially when you were in grade
school or somebody tells you something

190
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,199
then you tell that thing to somebody
else and they tell that thing to

191
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:12,210
somebody else and so on and so on

192
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,400
and what would want to

193
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,520
observed there

194
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,589
work distortions of the changes in the
forgetting is that take place

195
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:23,300
as people tell and retell stories

196
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,290
i won't tell you this story but this is
that one of those votes favorite story

197
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,650
it's a native american folk tale bump
two young men from egg you lack who went

198
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,130
down to the river to haunt c olson they
got picked up by a bunch of other

199
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,290
indians and i went to another village in
there was a fight and all sorts of

200
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,790
all sorts of very interesting things
happen

201
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,560
this is a native american folk tale
collected by the anthropologist franz

202
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,870
boss

203
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,920
from i tried in the northwestern part of
the united states

204
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,090
it's got all sorts of unfamiliar
material in a tunnel dot but i looked at

205
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,990
was the tell this to as it was a college
student all the subjects of his

206
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,420
laboratory

207
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,510
and that had them because they don't
tell the story back

208
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,030
and what he discovered

209
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,330
we're a couple of interesting things

210
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,110
first

211
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,470
subjects did engage in some forgetting

212
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,780
what bartlett called ever resolve all
mission

213
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,370
okay

214
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:22,360
so it was a progressive forgetting of
various elements of the story

215
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,089
all but that would notice

216
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:28,790
was that the progress of forgetting
affected mostly

217
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,080
narrator details

218
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,080
of the story the subjects and remembered
the gist of the story very well that's a

219
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,560
story about two of a above dot

220
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,139
about two indians mca picked up by some
other indians of the gulf and have a

221
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:42,680
flight to mirror hunting skills

222
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,180
they got that part

223
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,340
but they what dot the subjects would
forget

224
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,130
were all the minutiae

225
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,060
all the details in the story

226
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,620
moreover

227
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,740
it wasn't just a matter of forgetting

228
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,120
bartlett observed that subjects made
errors of

229
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,670
coalition

230
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,459
as well as all mission

231
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,260
then i remembered

232
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,160
elements of the story edwards actually
in the story

233
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,040
so for example they were to rationalize
various kinds of details so was to make

234
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,850
the story more sensible

235
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,630
to them as

236
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,649
young englishman who weren't familial or
that the lawyer

237
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:22,499
with native american of the culture they
will transform details

238
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:23,589
so that

239
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,780
all of the details of the more familiar
to them

240
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,589
whereas the indian but the story talks
about the indians in canoes

241
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,110
they might talk about indians in boats

242
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,570
okay although

243
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,489
his the general idea about object of
floats on water is there

244
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:44,369
but the exact word canoe was in their
and then i also transform the order

245
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,530
in which the story was told

246
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,359
again in apparent apparently in an
attempt to make it

247
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:55,210
order to make the story somewhat more
convenient

248
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:55,869
house

249
00:11:55,869 --> 00:12:00,820
and daughters working in his tradition
basically always observed

250
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,050
first of all the mission that is
forgiving of nonsense syllables or words

251
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,660
or whatever

252
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,640
tablets

253
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,669
technique allowed him to look at

254
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:11,509
or changes in memory

255
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:14,160
all reflected in these errors of
culmination

256
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,430
where the subjects would

257
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,310
bring material into

258
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,749
the or memory

259
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:21,820
that wasn't in the original

260
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,670
on the basis of theirs

261
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,390
bartlett argued

262
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:31,370
far from being eight matter of
reproducing the information from memory

263
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,110
rather remembering involved what he
called reconstructive activity

264
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,740
that is when we remember something we
don't simply retrieve information

265
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,079
from our heads

266
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,260
rather we'd

267
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,359
build off representation of the event

268
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:51,329
that we're trying to talk about we
constructed a new we reconstructed

269
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:52,529
in that spelling

270
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:55,730
is that what what happens but we
remember something

271
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,600
is that although we get all of our
memories

272
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,040
or sometime in details

273
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,649
indians canoes

274
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,960
arrows somebody dies that's the story of
the two young men from agile ac okay

275
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,160
it's very very big

276
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,810
is fragmentary it's ambiguous
information

277
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,530
he's diem all believe that his subjects
also observed also retrieved account of

278
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,130
general attitude is toward the story

279
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,080
but it was a good story or a bad story
of funny story ary itgi story or

280
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,459
whatever it was that was what they
retrieved

281
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:31,470
and then based on those fragmentary
details

282
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,339
they'd inferences

283
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:33,970
about

284
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,889
what was going on the story well-used on
the waters of the most of them something

285
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:42,439
about both so they were maybe they were
fishing instead of hunting for seals or

286
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:43,040
whatever

287
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,760
they would make us the in their biggest
inferences

288
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,820
they will be in for making inferences
about what was in the story

289
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,810
based on their general

290
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,650
framework all of the world knowledge
based on their knowledge and

291
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,900
expectations hall and and attitudes

292
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,850
to produce a coherent narrative or as as
coherent a narrative as they could

293
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,780
produce

294
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,160
but one which is not necessarily a
particularly good presentation of the

295
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,860
story

296
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,350
all of them know that if you ever get a
chance to read bartlett's book which

297
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,760
many of you will if you actually stick
with the psychology major

298
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,160
all you'll see that some of the uh... oh

299
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,200
world summons dot the stories department
subjects or produce work

300
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,179
really very bad representations of the
story that they were read

301
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:30,860
but they were more coherent no in many
ways

302
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,300
network after here

303
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,110
is yet another principle of memory

304
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,610
known as the reconstruction principle

305
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,730
and you'll see

306
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,639
that this is

307
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,670
a principal

308
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,730
that sounds very much like conclusion
that we came to

309
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,900
all at the end of the lectures on
sensation and perception

310
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,230
remember that

311
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,400
gibson had argued

312
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,360
that perceiving was simply a matter of
its team information from estimates that

313
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,000
that's all you had to do

314
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,020
whereas constructive tradition in
perception says

315
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:07,510
that they perceive a has to go beyond
the information given in the stimulus

316
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,429
and to supplement stimulus information

317
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:12,000
with general

318
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,069
doll world knowledge expectations
beliefs and so on where basically argued

319
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:19,389
but the same thing happened in memory

320
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:23,129
you retrieved some trace information
okay

321
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:27,790
but you also supplemented trace
information

322
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,909
general world knowledge with information
derived from

323
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:36,660
your dylan general knowledge expect of
expectations and beliefs

324
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,000
this is a new perspective on the study
of memory

325
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,390
albeit one that goes beyond the or the
idea of memory is information retrieval

326
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:51,420
and basically all or the connects or
understanding of how memory works

327
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,520
to our understanding of whole perception
works

328
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,550
sickens

329
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,050
bartlett

330
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:58,919
his

331
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:01,980
book back in the nineteen thirties

332
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,019
psychologists have been are able to

333
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:09,510
study the kinds of process ease that
bartlett talked about

334
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,110
within the context

335
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:15,950
all the familiar brutal learning
paradigm that we use uh... in memory

336
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,239
psychologists been quite ingenious i
think in trying to

337
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:19,820
all

338
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,309
or make of rigorous

339
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:27,459
fallen north experimental studies of the
kinds of things the poor little the

340
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:29,000
bullet pointed out

341
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,719
one of these parallel lines

342
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:35,099
a basically an adaptation of the verbal
warning paradigm for the study of

343
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:36,369
reconstructive principles

344
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:37,880
is bailout

345
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,310
called all the paradigm known as the
eyewitness memory paradigm

346
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:46,220
that was fault tho pioneered by
professor elizabeth loftis then at the

347
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,130
university of washington loftis is no
professor of psychology

348
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,000
at u_c_ herb i'm

349
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,180
and here

350
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,320
filed as a list of things but the
listeners are more or less continuous

351
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,240
scene

352
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,759
on

353
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,639
so that

354
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,819
there weren't isolated words and
pictures but rather there's a storm or

355
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:09,299
less continuous seen that makes a lot of
a on narrative presented either as a

356
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,300
slideshow or as a video

357
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,199
and then after

358
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,280
owned it's analogous to bartlett telling
his subjects the story of the two young

359
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,790
men from that you like

360
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,520
and then later on alm

361
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,970
walters will have

362
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:24,679
subjects

363
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:30,580
questions about what they've seen as if
they were i witness is of an accident or

364
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,040
crime or whatever

365
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,620
here's an example

366
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,200
bulb for the kind of thing that loftis
david

367
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,760
what i've got a short of going to show
you a little slideshow

368
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,920
and what i want you to do is to imagine
a direct ice tender watching at the

369
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:49,920
following scenes as they transpire

370
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,200
that's the same that's all you get to
see

371
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,570
now open for the next phase of the
experiment left us what ask particular

372
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,039
kinds of questions like

373
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:10,630
did anyone passed a couple while they
were walking down the driveway

374
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:17,630
that another car passed the red dotson
while it was stopped at the stop sign

375
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:24,860
was there another car industry when the
man entered the crosswalk

376
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,330
was the man in the red shirt the driver
of the dots of

377
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,360
okay notice of is all factual questions
and you can answer them

378
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,130
are correctly or incorrectly based on
your observations

379
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,370
the c

380
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,870
after the sub after we have to some
subjects answered those questions

381
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,850
she vendors

382
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,090
damn any recognition test in which she
presented them with

383
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,420
slides from the slideshow

384
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,140
slides that weren't in the slideshow and
asked them to indicate

385
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,570
which was which

386
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,150
so for example

387
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,740
which arby's

388
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,729
although of slides did you actually see

389
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:03,790
in the presentation

390
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,250
barbie

391
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,760
which of these lights did you see

392
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:17,760
the presentation a

393
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,440
yes you saw that when he saw the guy
actually in the crosswalk before at the

394
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,770
red dots and although you hit him

395
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,680
but you actually saw it

396
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,479
this slide

397
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:35,350
almost all go a lot of loftis is
subjects falsely recognized this slide

398
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,360
why are you

399
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,669
because

400
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,860
besides gotta stop sign in it

401
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,740
and they had already hard a question

402
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,920
remember

403
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,909
that another car passed the red dots and
while it was stopped at the stop sign

404
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:58,380
the question assumes that there was a
stop sign

405
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,230
in fact

406
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,750
there was a yield sign loftis was a
little tricky here she painted the yield

407
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,870
sign read

408
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,850
okay but still it's a triangular yield
sign that you saw not an octagonal

409
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,610
although the stop sign

410
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,340
but the fact that people

411
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,350
mister clark questioned that resolve the
existence of a stop sign

412
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,419
led to many of the laughter is the
subject

413
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:27,640
to falsely remember that they have
actually seen eighty stop sign

414
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,610
okay

415
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,410
this is what is known

416
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,440
as

417
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,090
the post event of misinformation affect
okay

418
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,370
it has a traffic accident there is a
critical question

419
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:43,320
which for some subjects is man leading
did you see a better car pass the reds

420
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,200
dog dotson while was stopped orwell was
stopped at the yield sign which is what

421
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,559
that is

422
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,080
or a leading question

423
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,529
did you see other can car pass the red
dotson while we stopped at the stop sign

424
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:59,400
a question of storms that there was a
stop sign

425
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,620
when in fact

426
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,410
their wasn't

427
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,900
here is the design of the study

428
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,039
some subjects or a yield sign

429
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,410
or other subjects or stop sign

430
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,440
some subjects were given a question

431
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,610
that referred to a yield sign ok which
is normally dean if you actually saw the

432
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,519
yield sign

433
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:21,510
but is misleading if you saw a stop sign

434
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,330
other subjects got a question assume the
existence of a stop sign

435
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,350
which is normally dean if you actually
saw the stop sign

436
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,450
but misleading

437
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,299
if you actually saw

438
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:32,780
you don't sign

439
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,610
and the results of the study on is that

440
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:41,850
subcompact our recognition of the sign
dropped by about fifty percent

441
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,600
okay

442
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,750
if law for the subjects we were given

443
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,170
the misleading or the question

444
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,160
so if you've got the car would be our do
not leading version of the author of the

445
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,960
inquiry

446
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,220
you were corrected

447
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,970
correctly recognize the stop sign about
seventy five eighty percent of the time

448
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,870
if you've got the misleading version

449
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,139
of the inquiry

450
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:04,340
correct recognition trough to about
forty over forty percent

451
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,610
this is what's known again as the post
events misinformation affect

452
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,090
and the idea here is

453
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,190
they're leading questions

454
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:18,070
asked brian interrogator ten influenced
pay all of the matter resolved by

455
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,790
witnesses okay

456
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,840
practices point here

457
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,720
is that memory isn't

458
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,390
purer

459
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:30,180
your memory other event isn't uncommon
today memory once and for all at the

460
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,240
time the event happened

461
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,960
rather when you remembered something

462
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,230
you take information that was uncoated

463
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,440
and you put it together with everything
else you know

464
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,010
including

465
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:45,559
the fact that somebody just as to a
question that resume the existence of a

466
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:46,520
stop sign

467
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,809
so that your final memory your father
though you remember the event

468
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,850
yes i've kind of blood

469
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,620
or information retrieved from memory

470
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,900
an information gathered from other
sources

471
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,640
on stove post event misinformation
effect

472
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,940
because here

473
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,740
knowledge acquired or events that occur
or after an event

474
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,940
can affect memory

475
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,310
although the low four events that
occurred before him

476
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:18,720
here is another example all of this kind
of reconstructive process in memory

477
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,690
all this is our work by kathleen
mcdermott and all on henry robert r at

487
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,160
injection syringe

488
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,950
and in this team

489
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,850
okay i think that's that's that's a list
of subject study

490
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,240
and it turns out

491
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,830
every one of these words of the study
list

492
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:58,360
has a semantic associate all got the
word neil

493
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,929
needle thread ten needle needles have
always and so on and so forth

494
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:05,859
and what happened in this study

495
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:09,790
was that have been studied or list ald

496
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,320
associates of the word new york

497
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,580
subjects

498
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,200
remembered

499
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,240
that they studied a public nato as well
then in fact day did not

500
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,140
here it is or dildo from that study

501
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,630
here's memory recognition memory for the
study items is pretty good about eighty

502
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:31,180
five ninety percent of the studied items
work correctly remembered

503
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,450
it turned out

504
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,130
that paul almost the same

505
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,330
percentage of subjects

506
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,789
for also remembered

507
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:38,220
studying

508
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,240
the word

509
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,710
needle as well

510
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,720
whereas

511
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,010
all of the word that was unrelated to
the list what the word sleep wasn't

512
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:51,380
falsely recognized all here we have
another example of bartlett's

513
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,670
reconstructive process

514
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:58,320
if you study of bunch of words all of
which had to deal with the same concept

515
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,160
you begin to show your memory around
that concept

516
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,860
not just around the words

517
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,009
at you studied

518
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:07,859
leedee noodle falsely remember

519
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,360
information that's consistent with the
concept

520
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,380
even though you didn't actually

521
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,500
all encounter

522
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,680
that information

523
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,749
so again

524
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:19,110
this this is known as the associate of
memory allusion

525
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,700
because people have an illusion

526
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,290
that they are not an illusion of memory

527
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,530
are that they actually started this word
when in fact they didn't

528
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,950
it's an illusion bentsen induced

529
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,720
by

530
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,600
the active studying all these associate
of lee

531
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,590
although the related words

532
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,050
again

533
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,990
though collisions in memory

534
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,370
just as there are illusions in
perception

535
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,720
and the implications while big
implication of these allusions in memory

536
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,639
is the same as the implication

537
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:53,780
of what of allusions in perception

538
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,890
and that is

539
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,830
but just as in perception

540
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:01,559
weeds we do more than extract college
the information from the stimulus

541
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:05,400
in memory we do more then retrieve
information

542
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,509
frome all

543
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:07,999
fro moans from storage

544
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:11,470
we go beyond the information given by
the stimulus

545
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,839
we go beyond the information given

546
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,059
by the memory or trace

547
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:17,660
so that we can

548
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,020
falsely

549
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,600
remember

550
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,179
in the same way

551
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:22,340
weakened falsely

552
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,610
or perceive

553
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:29,179
so damn we have these para phenomena in
perception and memory

554
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:30,869
in perceptual illusions

555
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:34,050
we perceive the president's inaccurately

556
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:39,040
there's a kind of systematic distortion
of systematic bias in our perception

557
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,110
that's a product

558
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,770
all of this constructive activity

559
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,889
entailed in going beyond the information
given

560
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:47,680
by the stimulus

561
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,350
similarly

562
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,320
we have allusions in memory

563
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,320
where we not proceeding with the
president inaccurately but we're

564
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,720
remembering at the past inaccurately and
again

565
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,960
are there systematic biases systematic
distortions here

566
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,450
so that we remember

567
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,790
the past

568
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,820
in a way that makes it consistent with
what we

569
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,050
believed to be the case

570
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,000
we remember the past

571
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,150
consistent with how we're perceiving the
present

572
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,010
and again

573
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,850
this is an example of going beyond the
information

574
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,280
that's given in the memory trace

575
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,099
so that we want to do now

576
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:30,249
is to explore the implication big
implications all of this reconstructed

577
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:32,760
principal and memory

578
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,119
that memory

579
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:38,530
is a blend of information when you
remember something

580
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,600
what you do

581
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,910
if you work on a mental representation
of some past event

582
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,230
not necessarily in accurate record of
that event

583
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,900
but rather your police

584
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,140
that event

585
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,550
memory is a with our memories are mental
representations of the past

586
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,070
that reflect a blend of information
contained in

587
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,669
memory traces things that are laid down
at the time of encoding

588
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:05,399
but also

589
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:06,009
information

590
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:08,839
that is derived from other sources

591
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:09,590
information that's

592
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,999
qatar provided by

593
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:15,110
or knowledge about the world or
expectations about the kinds of things

594
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:19,530
that go on and it or beliefs about world
and so on

595
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,490
making the point again

596
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:28,470
memories are knots best viewed as

597
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,450
in orange

598
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,350
in variable records of past experience
rather

599
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,940
when we remember something

600
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,120
what we're doing is we're reporting or
beliefs

601
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,970
about what happened

602
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,890
i believe that the dotson was stopped at
a stop sign

603
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,210
on the police needle was on the list

604
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,270
and so on and uh... and so forth

605
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,120
so i can of the library metaphor for
memory

606
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,120
can take you a long way in the study of
memory loved to try to analyze these

607
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,610
principles by which we encode
information memory

608
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,679
retainer in memory storage and retrieve
stored information

609
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,460
when we want to enter a question about
the past

610
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:13,340
the library of metaphor for memory is or
ism is a fairly good one as far as it

611
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,500
goes

612
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,229
but the important thing to remember is
that

613
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:21,799
remembering isn't really like reading
information from a book

614
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:22,440
remembering

615
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,940
is more like

616
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,740
writing

617
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,930
from fragmentary notes

618
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,390
fragmentary milton coated in memory and
then everything else follows

619
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,560
from or from our various software
various beliefs

620
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,720
so far we where we are now

621
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,510
is

622
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,760
we've got

623
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,120
unified view

624
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,190
are these two important cognitive
functions unified view our perception

625
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,330
and memory

626
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,420
when i started his lectures i reminded
you that

627
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,220
perception

628
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,940
dreads and memory in various ways

629
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,470
in order to

630
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,870
perceive the world we have to draw on

631
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,620
knowledge in police and expectations
that are represented in memory

632
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,970
we've also talked about how

633
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:09,970
perception

634
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,540
changes the contents of memory

635
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,799
because the act of proceeding

636
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,989
leaves the record

637
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:18,820
if you will trace or a nanogram

638
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,179
of what we've

639
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:20,889
perceived

640
00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:24,640
but more important perception and memory

641
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,690
perceiving the world in the present
remembering the world in the past

642
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,169
both reflect

643
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:33,230
effort after meanie

644
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,260
both the perceive ur

645
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,400
and the remember are trying to make
sense of what they've experienced

646
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,730
the person who is trying to make sense
of the world that he or she perceives

647
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,770
right now

648
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:51,320
the remember is trying to make sense of
the world that he or she experienced in

649
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,290
the past

650
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,070
perception and memory

651
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,529
both perceiving and remembering

652
00:31:58,529 --> 00:31:59,390
reflect

653
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,370
problem solving activity

654
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,529
the problem for the perceive ur

655
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:08,120
is to figure out what objects are out
there in the world

656
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,679
here they are

657
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,210
what they're doing

658
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,740
what can be done with them

659
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,699
and insulting that problem

660
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:17,670
the procedure takes information

661
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,910
from the stimulus environment

662
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,899
combines it with information retrieved

663
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,020
from memory

664
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,070
and produces

665
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,050
representation

666
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,970
all of the world

667
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,930
similarly

668
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,620
memory

669
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,850
the problem for the remember

670
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,610
it's difficult

671
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,990
what happened at such and such a time if
i say to you know what to do you have

672
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,460
for dinner last thursday

673
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,840
or that's a problem

674
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,640
right you got to know what what was was
thursday that they are when shopping

675
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,210
what would make it was too but with left
overnight what were leftovers where

676
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,150
there was some meat loaf maybe there was
some still toll for something like that

677
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,210
that i remember

678
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,860
trying to make sense of the question

679
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,179
trying to solve the problem posed by the
question

680
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:05,750
is what

681
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,159
uh... or

682
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,419
people do in the act of remembering

683
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:12,870
and this was bartlett's great insight

684
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,970
at me and i was thought of memory is
something we have

685
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,740
for eddie matos

686
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,340
memories and now it so i think that's
out there

687
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:27,150
on he even titled his book on their
memory in german

688
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,200
way the uh... went by the germans think
about it

689
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,130
alm over that at least aidid then

690
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,860
well it's

691
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,290
walk was titled remembering

692
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,880
for him

693
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,390
memory is not so much and now not so
much as being it's an activity

694
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:43,790
represented

695
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,379
by of bird

696
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:48,119
and it is reconstructive activity

697
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:53,710
by which the person challenge to
remember some of them from the past

698
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:57,000
all the information that is that his or
her disposal

699
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,960
and then

700
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,410
builds up

701
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,480
constructs reconstruct representation

702
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,870
that uh... of that passed a vent

703
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,710
so again

704
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,230
perception

705
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,609
and memory

706
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:12,139
all of the exemplify

707
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,260
this dream

708
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,019
of cognition as intelligent

709
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:17,839
problem solving activity

710
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:18,999
where people take

711
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:21,190
all the information that's available to
them

712
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,800
to try to solve the problem set for them

713
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,539
by their environment

714
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:28,439
will see the steam workout again

715
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:33,629
in the lectures that begin on wednesday
on thinking and reasoning and problem

716
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:34,280
solving

717
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,710
where again we'll see

718
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,819
or people attack

719
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:42,509
problems posed by their environment in
various kinds of ways

720
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:44,870
for now that we've got a little bit of
time

721
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:49,439
so let me are just stop and take
whatever questions you might have

722
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:53,789
about memory we haven't had that much
time for questions deflection sold for

723
00:34:53,789 --> 00:35:00,789
any questions about memory at all

724
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:06,569
that is the kind of question what's the
difference between short term memory and

725
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:07,490
working memory

726
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,220
that's the kind of question about which
there are fistfights conferences of

727
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,869
memory researchers i don't think there's
a dime's worth of difference between

728
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:17,279
short term memory and working memory

729
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:22,549
all part of part there are people out
there who all of the pope who think that

730
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:24,399
is the difference

731
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:29,049
for our purposes there is no difference
i would never ask you a question that i

732
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:29,430
asked

733
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:34,589
that has to make the distinction between
short term from reworking memory

734
00:35:34,589 --> 00:35:38,859
in fairly the differences

735
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:43,789
short term memory was conf was what was
the heart of construed in early memory

736
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:44,310
theories

737
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:49,150
as a place where information is held for
a relatively short period of time

738
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,429
and the point about

739
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:55,529
start switching the label from short
term memory to working memory was to

740
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:56,910
make it clear

741
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:02,940
that working memory was where work was
performed on memory okay it's not just a

742
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,880
passive storehouse of knowledge

743
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,789
but rather

744
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:08,680
it's a place where you you where

745
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,569
information is

746
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:12,720
brought into consciousness brought into
attention

747
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,479
did something with it used to solve a
problem or whatever

748
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:20,549
all it's a little more complicated than
that but that's basically all of the

749
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:21,439
basically it

750
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:23,020
but this tension between

751
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,859
so-called short term memory and
so-called long-term memory

752
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:29,049
thirty seconds

753
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:32,259
if that happened within the last thirty
seconds we tend to think of it is short

754
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:33,259
term memory

755
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:37,470
if it happened longer ago than that we
tend to think of it is long-term memory

756
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:41,480
that may seem like a stupid way to
define long-term memory but if you try

757
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,390
to remember something that happened
thirty seconds ago

758
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,679
that takes work

759
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:50,399
right or what was he talking about
thirty seconds ago what was that

760
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:53,309
landslide or or or whatever

761
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:56,059
charter memory has a kind of a media see
to it

762
00:36:56,059 --> 00:36:59,009
wears a kind of directory dialed from
consciousness

763
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:03,709
whereas of long-term memory you're
actually trying to recover a conscious

764
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:04,180
state

765
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,159
that you experienced in the past

766
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,540
so don't get don't get

767
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,020
caught up on short-term versus working
memory

768
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,499
if you take professor glenn berg's

769
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:17,839
although professor shlomo result of
memory course like one twenty two

770
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,709
you'll get about a week on that

771
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:22,379
all but for our purposes you don't have
to worry about it

772
00:37:22,379 --> 00:37:28,849
i had a question down here

773
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:33,549
these principles work for all types of
memory not address

774
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:37,959
but they are specially the principles
that govern episodic ur autobiographical

775
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:38,509
memory

776
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:41,759
when i started the memory lectures i
said we're going to talk about that the

777
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,039
sonic memory here

778
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:47,769
and that's where these principles have
basically been on covered

779
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:51,259
in the next set of lectures we're going
to talk a little bit about semantic

780
00:37:51,259 --> 00:37:52,150
memory

781
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,829
and we're going to talk a little bit
about procedural memory

782
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:57,060
you'll see that there are some
differences

783
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,420
but still

784
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,939
on

785
00:38:00,939 --> 00:38:01,749
encoding

786
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:06,249
a semantic memory depends on elaboration
organization

787
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:11,959
retrieving a semantic memory depends on
she win for mation and so on so that

788
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,509
does the same kinds of principle still
do a ploy

789
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:21,509
to some extent

790
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:36,949
altera voters what kind of memory

791
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:41,139
that that's very fancy called identical
memory

792
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:44,939
identical review i d_d_t_ i_c_i_ derek
memory

793
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:48,919
and acclaimed as the focal all
photographic memory that some

794
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:51,979
individuals have where that something
passes and for them just once and they

795
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:54,359
can remember it forever

796
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:55,029
all the

797
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:59,490
i got a crime rate is something that's
nice if you've got it but hardly anybody

798
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,479
does

799
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:02,410
also poland

800
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:05,119
hence the violate some of these kinds of
principles

801
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,849
but even all the studies of people have
fun normal memories

802
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:10,949
show that

803
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:14,539
the reason they have phenomenal memories
is not that they have some kind of

804
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:16,550
photographic process in their heads

805
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,590
but rather

806
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,039
then intuitively use

807
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,549
the kinds of principles

808
00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:26,130
that we talk about here or the into a
deadly elaborate on their memories they

809
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:31,059
organize them in various ways to use
lots retrieval cues and so on

810
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:32,219
almost sold out

811
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:36,159
even i'd so-called identical rs bill
really violate of these rules even

812
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:38,099
though they seem to have

813
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:39,480
phenomenal memory so i

814
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,979
i knew a guy

815
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:43,329
ones too

816
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:44,809
sat down and memorize

817
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,130
a list of

818
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,799
four hundred words in a single sitting

819
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:51,980
it just hugged for nominal ability to
memorize stuff

820
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:56,239
didn't do him any good in life i don't
think but uh...

821
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,700
when you look at how we did it

822
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:04,700
use these kinds of principles

823
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,329
sqn congruent to their insurrection
remembered it better than schema

824
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:13,349
cochran's events

825
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:17,999
and the reason i remembered better is
that when we experience

826
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:23,610
an event that violates our expectations
that's inconsistent with what we believe

827
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,989
we tend to do is

828
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:28,859
try to explain how that event occurred

829
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:34,309
and that extra explanatory activity
creates a more elaborate

830
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:35,130
butcher

831
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,259
memory trace

832
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:43,259
than would otherwise be the case

833
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,529
yeah what they'll do is they will change
it but they did not did that subjects

834
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:52,060
would rationalize would change something
that didn't make sense

835
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,179
and then they remember did very well

836
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:56,899
they remembered

837
00:40:56,899 --> 00:41:01,359
they'll remember that away they changed
it so that it made sense

838
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,859
the ex drug

839
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:07,140
cognitive activity is what they
remembered not the event itself okay so

840
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,559
they won't mind i'll remember that the
place was egg you lack

841
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:13,339
right the name of the village

842
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:14,399
dino

843
00:41:14,399 --> 00:41:17,309
female british college students they
might remember

844
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,959
fall on eldon

845
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:21,890
cassell didn't sounds like a cue lack
and that's the name that would be

846
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:22,580
familiar

847
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,069
uh... to uh... to them

848
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:26,239
alm

849
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:29,389
but again does the scheme of

850
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:32,459
the steam out of the schematic
processing principle

851
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:33,940
of all

852
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,549
reflex

853
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:36,410
the relationship between

854
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,939
what you're trying to remember

855
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:39,800
and what you already know

856
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,909
okay

857
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:41,619
and

858
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:43,790
if it's consistent with what we already
know

859
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:48,579
we remember that fairly well because for
the orignal provides extra q information

860
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:51,339
if it's inconsistent with what we
already knew

861
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:53,229
on what we're talking about people do

862
00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:57,079
if you remember it better by virtue of
this elaborate of activity this this

863
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:58,579
explanatory activity

864
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:03,389
but you may remember in a distorted
fashion

865
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:04,269
alm

866
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:05,790
sold out to all

867
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,400
all

868
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,610
if i save you well what the judy do when
you say well on judy had difficulty

869
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:12,399
remembering

870
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:13,370
the uh...

871
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,799
but the chair difficulty understanding
the daytime television show

872
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:20,969
but you but you also remembers your
explanation for that

873
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:25,019
she had difficulty remembering the
daytime television show because she was

874
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:28,759
preparing her role acceptance speech for
the nobel prize

875
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:32,509
or something like that right and that
wasn't in the story

876
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:37,359
they'll remember for the event well but
your email remember in this distorted

877
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,719
fashion that was one of bartlett's
insights

878
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:46,719
well in the back yes

879
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:55,569
m evolutionary purpose to the fact that
we armed

880
00:42:55,569 --> 00:43:02,569
remember our beliefs but not accurate
records

881
00:43:02,969 --> 00:43:07,660
i think about answer the question two
ways the first day is it's probably a

882
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:13,160
mistake to look for an adaptive purpose
to every to every feature of the job

883
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,649
that that uh... that we present

884
00:43:15,649 --> 00:43:20,319
or memory is a very adaptive thing to
have okay

885
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,579
alm

886
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:25,479
and what the reasons that the deputies
that almost as to

887
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:27,019
control their behavior

888
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:31,209
although but private behavior controlled
by things other than what's immediately

889
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:33,079
present in the environment

890
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:34,369
okay

891
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:37,039
alm

892
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:40,499
that but what do you memory works

893
00:43:40,499 --> 00:43:44,859
is also adapted because dole's done a
lot of things out there that happen and

894
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:50,009
you don't necessarily want to remember
every one of those things okay

895
00:43:50,009 --> 00:43:53,949
so memory has a way of all

896
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:55,690
we're putting things together

897
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,160
so that you

898
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,359
our group things together so you can
remember individuals individual items

899
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:06,359
better but not remember them as
individual items ok so all that's very

900
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:10,759
adaptive part of memory but not
everything we do is adaptive in that

901
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:15,029
sense stephen jay gould every step of
they had a great example of why do we

902
00:44:15,029 --> 00:44:17,130
have two arms and two legs

903
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,859
we have two arms into lakes not because
that's particularly adaptive

904
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:22,730
we have two arms into legs

905
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:26,139
because for descended from fish that had
four fins

906
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:30,109
okay that's just that's thus that's the
whole story right

907
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:34,869
memory has the properties that has the
class of

908
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:39,709
certain constraints on human information
processing we can't remember everything

909
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:43,849
that's happened to us we can't process
everything that's happened to us

910
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:47,669
what we remember is going to be filtered
through attention going to be filtered

911
00:44:47,669 --> 00:44:52,739
through believes it's going to be
filtered through world knowledge

912
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:55,599
we have time for one or two more
questions i think there is an exam

913
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:02,599
coming up so there's going to be some
noise

914
00:45:07,279 --> 00:45:10,089
yeah is there some kind of medium term
memory

915
00:45:10,089 --> 00:45:12,229
no i'm not really

916
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:15,739
as i say want to get past about thirty
seconds

917
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:17,700
well any period of distraction at all

918
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,079
you're really operated on long-term
memory in your following these

919
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:22,799
principles

920
00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:26,129
okay i think there is an exam coming in
so we're going to let you guys go a

921
00:45:26,129 --> 00:45:27,390
little bit early

922
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,760
horsing around the state west are
talking about think you know language
