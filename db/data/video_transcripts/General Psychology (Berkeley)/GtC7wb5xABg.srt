1
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:10,309
okay

2
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:13,509
last time we discussed

3
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:14,480
principles

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,159
that seemed to govern the encoding stage
of memory processing

5
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:22,909
actually free but only to pertain to
long-term memory

6
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:26,460
there are three things you can do with
an item of the poor i thought that the

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,869
operative encoding

8
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,419
the first is to engage in in

9
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:32,559
what we think of as well

10
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:33,789
maintenance reversal

11
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:37,219
simply repeated an item over and over
and over again

12
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:41,140
the way you might repeat a telephone
number that you've just looked up in a

13
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,340
telephone book

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,830
before you get a chance to dialect

15
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,790
that repetition

16
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,740
fine for maintaining and item in
inactive state and what we call short

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,020
term or primary memory

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,350
but it's not particularly good

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,469
adnan coating the eddie lasting trace of
a memory

20
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:06,100
in what we call a long-term or secondary
memory

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,080
for a time for that you have to do some
other things

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,460
what i think you have to do is to engage
in all of that sort of processing

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,680
alm

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,899
think about individual items that you're
trying to remember

25
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:24,200
in such a ways to connect off these
individual items with information that

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,170
you already possess in memory

27
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,390
and we saw in the death of processing
experiment

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,219
that the deeper the processing the more
elaborate the processing

29
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,110
but better the memory is going to to be

30
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,550
the third motive processing at the time
of encoding is a little bit different

31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,389
from that

32
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:46,840
and that's known as a organizational
processing

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,899
and in organizational processing

34
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,679
we're not so concerned with relating
individual items on information to

35
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,550
something you already know

36
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,040
rather a registered in relating to
individual items of information

37
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,800
to each other

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,049
and the general idea of a car

39
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,100
the mayor of this organizational
activity

40
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,740
that you engage in

41
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,140
all of the better

42
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,649
obscure subsequent memory is going to be

43
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:15,140
you'll aberration an organization

44
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,600
are the true

45
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,800
primary principles

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,070
that control what goes on

47
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,239
at the time of encoding

48
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:24,750
no we want to do

49
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,870
is to assume that a memory trays has
been adequately uncoated

50
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,029
well-organized

51
00:02:31,029 --> 00:02:32,880
and once it's in coated

52
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,430
that memory trace

53
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,190
becomes unbearable

54
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,419
for used

55
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:39,809
by the individual

56
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:41,529
and what we want to know now

57
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:44,060
is what happens to was subsequently

58
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,760
well the first answer is that had memory
that memory remains at a highly active

59
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,450
state so long as the individual

60
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,200
pays attention to it

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,099
refreshes it

62
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,359
all rehearses itt

63
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:00,570
in that room fashion that we know that
we talked about later

64
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,019
but you can't do that all the time you
look up a phone number

65
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,660
on babies have repeated yourself forever

66
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,740
right you gotta think about other things
you gotta look up on their phone number

67
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,179
is you've got a attend classes you've
gotta watch t_v_

68
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:14,650
or whatever it is you do

69
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,029
it's about a point when you stop
actively rehearsing the item

70
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:23,310
but the retention of herbal really
begins and what we want to know is

71
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,000
what now happens over the retention
interval

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,139
when a memory has been and coated

73
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,790
and placed in storage

74
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,019
and what happens

75
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,930
to make a long story short

76
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,530
is that you start forgetting the
information

77
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,079
immediately

78
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,769
how many times have you

79
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:41,220
look up a phone number

80
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,950
dialed it

81
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,040
talk to the person and then

82
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,730
alm

83
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,360
serology what was that phone number or
you need somebody at a party

84
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,549
and you turn your attention away for a
second

85
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,279
and then you have difficulty remembering
his were her name that's what happens to

86
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,610
be in forgetting

87
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,709
and it's something that happens over the
all over the retention interval

88
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,220
and we want to know wide that occurs
okay

89
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,419
well the first thing

90
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:11,680
is to show that it occurs and this is
the second major finding all of this

91
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,629
classic

92
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:18,189
pioneering study of memory by every
house back in the eighteen hundreds

93
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:18,959
very impt

94
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,949
on the experiment that i showed you last
time

95
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,279
last time we saw a cs an experiment by
having house in which he buried the

96
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:30,120
number of repetitions that he gave too

97
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,760
these nonsense syllables

98
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,869
and then looked at memory is a function
of repetition

99
00:04:34,869 --> 00:04:38,190
what we're doing here what they've been
hosted in this experiment

100
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,539
is to

101
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:40,630
learn

102
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,760
memorize a list of nonsense syllables
all according to some criterion of all

103
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,119
of mastery

104
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,119
and then

105
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,650
very the retention interval

106
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,280
fraum twenty minutes

107
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,709
to an hour

108
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:58,379
about nine hours a day two days seven
days that's six weeks or something like

109
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:59,379
that

110
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,589
all

111
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:01,629
and off

112
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:03,060
quite a bit to see

113
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,490
why what happened to this sort of memory
trace as a function of time

114
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,649
and he measured memory again in terms of
savings in relearning

115
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:14,509
so is looking at the strength of the
memory

116
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:15,080
all

117
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,840
as a department in terms of hollow

118
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,929
much effort it's going to take him to
move to relearn the thing later on

119
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:25,500
more settled more savings meaning a
stronger memory trace

120
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,100
and what you can see here is

121
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,680
that there is pretty substantial savings
after just a twenty minute retention

122
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,370
interval

123
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,270
but the savings drop off quite rapidly

124
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,580
after an hour we're down below fifty
percent savings

125
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,149
after

126
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:41,509
eight or nine hours from down below
forty percent savings

127
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:44,020
after saw a couple of weeks

128
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,330
were way down to or just twenty percent
savings in their own relearning

129
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,199
so this is a typical result of these
kinds of experiments

130
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,509
and uh... that is a progressive
forgetting with time

131
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,870
forgetting increases with the retention
interval

132
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,080
and this is just a very simple

133
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,289
early example

134
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:09,979
on next principle of memory function
which we call the time dependency

135
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:10,449
principle

136
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:14,999
which simply says that memory diminishes
as a function of the length of the

137
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,120
retention interval

138
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,570
the longer the retention interval

139
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,479
fold less memory

140
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,639
going to have

141
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,920
now that's fine

142
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,369
but psychologist what we really want to
know is why does this occur

143
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,919
wide his memory fade with time

144
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,289
all-white whitewater do we had this kind
of progressive forgetting

145
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,779
and over the years

146
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:38,100
psychologists have entertained

147
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,089
at least four different hypotheses

148
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:43,139
about what clauses

149
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,740
time dependency in memory

150
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,550
the first of these

151
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,809
always known as the decay hypothesis

152
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:54,449
and the idea here is simply

153
00:06:54,449 --> 00:07:00,139
tien phillies memories in the same way
that prolonged exposure to the sun will

154
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,639
fade a photograph

155
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,029
or prolonged exposure to the wind

156
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:07,199
will adult will or you raise footprints

157
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,620
in the sand at uh... at the beach

158
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,479
it's a passive

159
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,770
process of decay

160
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,219
that things simply go away

161
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:17,649
flow with time

162
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:21,429
every second hypothesis concerning time
dependency

163
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:24,870
is what's known as the consolidation
hypothesis

164
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,749
and the idea here is

165
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:29,520
empty and voting process

166
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,839
does not happen

167
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,289
instantaneously

168
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:38,379
rather it actually takes time for a
memory to become

169
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:43,070
firmly implanted in storage and if you
do something

170
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,159
during this consolidation interval

171
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:49,789
you could prevent the memory from being
adequately are

172
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:51,240
adequately stored

173
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,650
also that the consolidation of prophet
opposites

174
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,029
and get what's happening here

175
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:56,619
z ideas that

176
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:58,469
happens through the memory

177
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:59,680
during this interval

178
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,930
when it's in a somewhat are somewhat
vulnerable state

179
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,820
authored a hypothesis

180
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,009
is all

181
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,990
what's known as the displacement
hypothesis

182
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,560
and the idea behind the displacement
hypothesis is that the

183
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,270
storage space if you will in memory

184
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,879
is ltd

185
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,819
and there comes a point where if you're
going to put new information you've got

186
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,879
to take some information out

187
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,539
if you've got a visit to take about a
computer metaphor of unit moved for a

188
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,259
minute

189
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,860
on wed when you're

190
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,160
hardest gets full

191
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,630
in order to make room for something new
that your office you're working on

192
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,800
you've got to a raise something else or
a more mechanical

193
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,300
or analogy would be a file drawer
there's only so much room in a file

194
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,099
drawer right

195
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:50,759
and if you're going to put keep putting
forth wild folders in the file drawer

196
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,620
you're gonna have to get uh... throw
some doubt

197
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,040
that's the general idea behind the
displacement hypothesis

198
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,920
and basically what it says it is

199
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,400
that called information tends to be
displaced

200
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,189
from eleven displaced by new information

201
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:08,630
and that displacement constitutes all
laws

202
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,370
memory storage a permanent loss

203
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,690
from memory storage

204
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,959
before the pipe offices

205
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,930
is different from that and that is
what's known as the interference

206
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,910
hypothesis and the idea behind
interference

207
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,500
met information isn't lost from memory
permanently

208
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,110
but rather the accumulation in of
knowledge in memory

209
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,700
makes it harder for you to get at any
particular item of information

210
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,910
again if you think about a flat out or
metaphor for memory

211
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,140
if he just keeps stopping stuff again

212
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,140
although i thought that the war stuff
that's on the file drawer

213
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,259
the harder it's going to be to find any
particular piece

214
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:51,430
of all of information let's use a nice
filing system

215
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,570
like alphabetical order

216
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,320
over or something like that

217
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,029
but the important thing here

218
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,940
is that are

219
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,740
in in the process of displacement you're
actually losing memories from storage

220
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,869
and documentaries art of storage

221
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:09,640
whereas in in interference bumped the
out the nudging question

222
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,919
remains unavailable in storage

223
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,280
but they're simply eight failure

224
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,140
retrieve it

225
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,460
it turns out

226
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,850
that each of these four

227
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,570
hypotheses about time dependency

228
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,470
applies to a different kind of memories

229
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,710
but talking here about long-term memory
episodic memory

230
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,100
and it turns out

231
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,370
that all of as far as long-term memory
is concerned

232
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,100
the primary determinant of
time-dependent forgetting

233
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,120
is interference

234
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,110
not passive decay

235
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,289
not consolidation filter

236
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:50,040
not displacement but rather

237
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,650
time-dependent forgetting

238
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,700
seems to occur by virtue of the fact
that

239
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,500
individual items stored in memory

240
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,820
interfere with each other

241
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,730
each of the items stored in the country

242
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,990
makes it harder to yet at another item

243
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,320
in memory

244
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,960
although so we get

245
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,330
what we know as the interference
principal long-term memory which

246
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,660
basically says

247
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,060
won some memory is uncoated

248
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,910
strategy is

249
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,920
for all intents and purposes permanent

250
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,180
there is no permanent forgetting of
anything and aren't you know that in

251
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,920
storage

252
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,010
but rather all time-dependent forgetting

253
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,499
occurs by virtue

254
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:33,330
or interference

255
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,870
and this principle of interference

256
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,009
or is always illustrated by what's known
as the paradox but the paradox of

257
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:44,970
interference which basically says that
the more you know especially the more

258
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,099
you know about any particular thing

259
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:50,979
the harder it is to get any particular
item of information

260
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:54,189
it's a little counter-intuitive you
think well if you're an expert on

261
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:56,249
something about all the stuff of the tip
of your

262
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,089
our fingers

263
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:58,200
but it's not true

264
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,450
the more you know the harder it is to
get at any particular item of

265
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,120
information

266
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,870
here is a classic demonstration of this
by john anderson a psychologist at

267
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,710
carnegie mellon all university

268
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,950
what anderson did is very simple metrics
permit

269
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,250
in which he asked subjects to

270
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,590
memorized sentences

271
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,120
that represent

272
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,339
represented fax

273
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,399
about people in locations of these work

274
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,500
is just cut mindlessly

275
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,950
material those are very profound
experiment

276
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,630
so subjects rest alert about that those
sentenced the doctor is in the bank

277
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,800
and the fireman is in the park

278
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,010
and the lawyer is in the church

279
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,480
and the lawyer is in the park

280
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,460
notice what happens here

281
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,179
dr

282
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,540
and bank that's a unique person

283
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,850
and that's a unique location

284
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,400
here we have a fireman who is a unique
person

285
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,950
but he's in the park which is also where
the lawyer is so we have

286
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,800
into individuals

287
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,690
associated with the same location

288
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,110
and then we have

289
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,860
the water is in the church

290
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,020
and the lawyers in the park

291
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,390
one individual associated

292
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,510
part of the part of the locations

293
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,710
so anyway

294
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:17,180
what anderson dead was to read asking
subjects to memorize services like this

295
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,790
are to a ought to uh... to a criterion
of memory

296
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,619
and then he simply ask them

297
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:24,639
to perform a recognition test

298
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,480
in which they were simply asked

299
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,300
did you study this ends

300
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,730
so if i ask you did you study the doctor
is in the bank you'd say yes

301
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,179
if i ask you if you studied the doctor
is in the park

302
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:42,240
you would sim simply say no to that

303
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,300
these

304
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,440
subjects

305
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,689
memorize these fences to a criterion of

306
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:48,539
perfect learning

307
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:53,110
so they performed almost perfectly
obvious recognition test

308
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,800
but whatever sanded

309
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,310
was to measure that's fine

310
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,699
that it took subjects

311
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:02,529
to successfully all recognize these
items

312
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:03,670
and he god

313
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,710
onset of response elite and sees hall
like this

314
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,840
so here

315
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,920
we have

316
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,290
all vd

317
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,810
subject to memorize one fact about a
target

318
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,230
to fax a lot of target were three facts
about a target

319
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,300
here one fact about a location

320
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,749
two facts about a target

321
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:24,439
or three facts about a target and
they're making judgments about ivins

322
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:25,999
they actually studied

323
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,610
or fake items that they didn't study

324
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,930
and that you can see in this light is
these are small businesses like small

325
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,800
reaction time differences

326
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,220
in terms of experimental psychology
these are big affects these are very big

327
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,170
differences

328
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,369
and you can say

329
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:43,250
that it took subjects

330
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,260
last time

331
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,520
to verify fact where they are going to
learn one fact about a person

332
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,760
then if they have learned to were three
facts about a port

333
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,540
less time to verify

334
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,350
if they weren't one fact about a
location that if they have learned

335
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,010
to or three fax about a location

336
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,310
this is known as the fat effect

337
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:09,610
response latency increases with a number
of facts you know about doctors and

338
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,020
lawyers and fireman and parks and banks
in churches

339
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,469
the more you know about these
individuals

340
00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:19,130
the more you know about these locations
the harder it is

341
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,470
to retrieve any particular

342
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,140
island of information

343
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,440
and this illustrates the of yell fan
effect in memory

344
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,060
again

345
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:32,300
leads us to restate the time dependency
principle

346
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,430
that so far at the long term endeavor
memory is concerned in any event

347
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:43,320
memory diminishes with time but it does
suck mostly by virtue of interference

348
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,279
competing memories interfere with each
other

349
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,599
get in the way

350
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:49,610
of the retrieval

351
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,320
called and get in the play of the
retrieval process

352
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,629
this interference principle

353
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:58,410
all the intern

354
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,270
leads us to

355
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:05,879
state an important distinction that all
that that applies to allowed to memory

356
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,839
and that is the distinction between

357
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,950
the availability of a memory in storage

358
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,870
and the accessibility

359
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,310
all of that memory

360
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,240
when you want to retrieve it

361
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,800
and make are gonna make use of it

362
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,270
knowledge may be available in memory

363
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,759
but by virtue of interference among
competing memories

364
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,450
it may be hard to gain access to
available knowledge

365
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,810
when you will

366
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,500
when you want it

367
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,879
so that's the distinction between
availability and accessibility

368
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:42,559
and we're going to see that uh... come
into play in just a couple minutes that

369
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,239
general point however

370
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,310
is that

371
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,660
although

372
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,990
memory encoding

373
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,260
memory storage is essentially permanent

374
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,750
not all memories available in storage

375
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,880
or equally accessible

376
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,130
not all memories of billable in storage
or equally are raw are wrong

377
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,090
equally accessible

378
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,760
at any particular time

379
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,860
so how do you gain access to a memory

380
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,730
how is it

381
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,080
that we gain access reach back and

382
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,750
firing

383
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,480
on knowledge that we've

384
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,410
although that we've stored in memory

385
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,199
but general idea here is

386
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,000
that accesses stimulated by a clearing
if i save you what did you have for

387
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,890
dinner last night that's a question

388
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,290
and that's supposed to alter the guide
your research through memory you don't

389
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,309
look for your pet's names

390
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:34,550
in response to a question like that

391
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,909
you don't look for your record of
lunches

392
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:38,830
in response to a question like that

393
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,570
you know look column onto your memories
from early childhood

394
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,850
or rather you focus your retrieval

395
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,299
yesterday

396
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:54,020
if i ask you while when did columbus on
uh... across the ocean

397
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,850
then you look for knowledge that you
have a blog columbus

398
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,980
not for knowledge you have about

399
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,870
neil armstrong or whatever

400
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,330
so whenever we try to gain access to
memory

401
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,720
we do it in the form of some kind of
question about what happened in the past

402
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,990
and then the subject

403
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,080
has to add information

404
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,720
from memory

405
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,149
information

406
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:16,390
that constitutes

407
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,619
the home

408
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,430
you know the answer the question

409
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,540
bi chai by retrieving

410
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,760
gaining access

411
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,260
to available information stored

412
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,020
in memory

413
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,120
so that's this distinction incumbent
memories

414
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,090
available in storage may not be
accessible

415
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,529
when retrievals attempted

416
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,580
may not be accessible for example

417
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,630
by virtue

418
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,210
interference so now what we want to do
is to explore some of the factors

419
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,220
governing retrieval

420
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,070
we're going to assumed elementary sprays

421
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:54,660
has been adequately uncoated by virtue
of elaborate is an organizational

422
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,730
activity

423
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,000
and we're also going to assume that that
memory trace

424
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,990
as nao reb now remains available in
storage

425
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,240
overseas

426
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,770
on the all over some retention interval
it hasn't been in a syndicated hasn't

427
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,950
been

428
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,750
displays that hasn't off

429
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,740
or there is a bit of failure of
consolidation hits in there

430
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,850
it's available

431
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,350
and the question now is

432
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,260
how do we gain access

433
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,370
to available memories

434
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,179
and the short answer is

435
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:24,850
gaining access to available memories

436
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,890
is on that or

437
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,950
of having

438
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,220
of particular

439
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,950
retrieval

440
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,850
cues

441
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,580
consider for example

442
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,519
three different kinds of memory test

443
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,190
that are commonly used

444
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,900
in experiments all of this sort

445
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,480
free recall cued recall

446
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,540
and recognition

447
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,340
and uh... free recall

448
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,559
the query to memory

449
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,760
basically is a very very query

450
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,520
and simply sites

451
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,650
sometime and someplace where something
happened

452
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,130
if i say to you

453
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,860
why did you do last night

454
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,320
focused your intention on some
particular

455
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,780
piece of the past or

456
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,000
what did you do the last time you
weren't pullman a whole

457
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,390
okay

458
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,760
all what i want you to do

459
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,779
is simply to tell me what happened in
that particular event

460
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:18,790
in the bronco learning paradigm

461
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,450
for your call queries

462
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,669
usually take the formal

463
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,740
what were the words on the list

464
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,970
gain you don't ask anybody that you
don't provide any more information than

465
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,539
that

466
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,730
is simply say what were the words on the
list

467
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,630
by contrast include recall

468
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,910
the query to memory

469
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:42,910
provides more identifying information
about the target avent so for example i

470
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:46,020
could say all what were the color words

471
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,450
on the list that i showed you

472
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,770
last time and then you can

473
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,510
focus attention on color words

474
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:57,019
and not think about the other words that
were on the list like the body parts of

475
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:01,440
the four four deductibles or all or
whatever

476
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,580
or we can give you a wicked mission test

477
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,149
all wear in fact

478
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:07,720
the query

479
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,330
contains

480
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,850
a copy of the target

481
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:15,029
again if i said was orange one of the
words on the list

482
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:17,549
that you read last time we were in class

483
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,710
so have already presented the word for
you

484
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,349
and all you have to do is find it in
memory

485
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:23,309
and say

486
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:25,490
on say yes or no

487
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,909
you're familiar with this distinction

488
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:30,590
from your history of academic testing

489
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,540
free recall

490
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,480
short answer

491
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,320
okay

492
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,469
there is a long-term potentiation

493
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:40,399
and ended on the right down a
description of what long-term

494
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,960
potentiation is

495
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,080
cued recall okay

496
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,320
arm

497
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,030
that were all but what's the l

498
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,240
mean of trace logbook conditioning or
something like that what's a distinction

499
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,260
between trees conditioning belay
conditioning

500
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,790
here the query

501
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,750
adds information i don't say tell me
everything you know about classical

502
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,020
conditioning

503
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,360
rather write focus the question so that
you have a better idea of what you're

504
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,230
looking for in memory

505
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,270
and then

506
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,030
finally and recognition test

507
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,190
that's your typical multiple-choice exam

508
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,990
okay

509
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,080
essay

510
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,540
fill in the blanks

511
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,840
multiple-choice

512
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,600
very good analogies

513
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,860
all for friedrich all tests

514
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,169
cued recall tests

515
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:25,509
and recognition

516
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:27,180
tests in memory

517
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,440
here's an experiment

518
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,790
by handled holden and michael watkins is
the same michael watkins whose work i

519
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,330
showed you last time

520
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,970
comparing the results of free

521
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,230
cued recall and recognition

522
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,979
tests of memory here are subjects were
simply as to

523
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:44,540
study a list of words

524
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,250
and then for the free recall test

525
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,480
the rest report what the words were that
they've studied

526
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,080
on the cute recall test

527
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,159
they were asked to farm

528
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,620
flaw order the rest report

529
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:01,220
the color words or the names of four
four footed animals or whatever anna

530
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,250
recognition test they were asked
questions like

531
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,570
was one of the words on the list orange

532
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,010
or was one of the words on the list
purple

533
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,680
art here were plotting the number of
items remembered in response to each of

534
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,679
these tests

535
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:20,800
and what you can see is that free recall
doesn't produce much memory

536
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,440
cued recall produces quite a bit more
memory about twice as much or memory

537
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,140
and recognition are testing produces
quite a bit of memory

538
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,680
reckon chin test

539
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,980
as a rule

540
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,090
art easier

541
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,640
recall tests

542
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,810
of memory is easier to remember
something on a recognition test

543
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,110
that it is part of free recall test

544
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,200
and among recall tests

545
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,910
killed recall tends to be easier

546
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:55,260
as a test land on their memory this is a
typical result in these kinds of of

547
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,490
experiments and as a result

548
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,990
illustrates yet another principle of
memory bitches

549
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,090
what's known as the q dependency
principle

550
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,369
and memory in here would basically say

551
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:10,509
that memory depends on the

552
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:13,210
on mount of information provided

553
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:19,440
by the retrieval cue memory depends on
the informational value barbecues

554
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:19,960
provided

555
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,200
at the time of retrieval

556
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,679
free recall test

557
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,659
doesn't provide much information what
words on the west

558
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:28,840
that's all you get

559
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,330
cued recall tests

560
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,720
provide more

561
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,409
information over the color words on the
list

562
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:38,050
what where the body parts on the list

563
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,210
recognition tests

564
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:39,920
provide

565
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,510
lots and lots of information about the
target memory

566
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,469
was it all range or purple

567
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:46,520
was that finger

568
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,350
or fort wasn't lyanne

569
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,710
or tiger

570
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,950
or whatever

571
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,860
so the q dependency principal basically
says

572
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:00,260
you can gain access to memory by virtue
of

573
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,330
retrieval cues

574
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,520
and the richer

575
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,860
the more informative these retrieval
cues are

576
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,730
but more likely you are

577
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,300
to gain access

578
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,899
to information

579
00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:13,650
stored

580
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,210
so let's stop for a second see if there
are any questions

581
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,710
about

582
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,320
dependency principal and about the q
dependency principle

583
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,490
the distinction between availability and
accessibility

584
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:26,889
and

585
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:33,889
the problem of interference anything at
all about this

586
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:41,550
now let's go one step

587
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:46,879
we usually but what i have portrayed and
coding and retrieval process is so far

588
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,000
i portray them as one related to each
other

589
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,160
on memory gets uncoated

590
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,529
and then it gets retrieved okay

591
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:59,379
but it turns out to think about it for a
second there it is an interesting

592
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:03,240
interaction between encoding and
retrieval process these

593
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,040
which is that retrieval cues

594
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,840
ten compensate

595
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,870
four

596
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,720
port increase all of the poor processing
at the time of encoding

597
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,740
if u

598
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,869
don't engage

599
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:19,940
in elaborate is an organizational
processing at the time of encoding

600
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,309
you're probably not going to produce
very much on eighty-three recall test

601
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:25,600
of memory

602
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,760
but you'll probably remember more on a
recognition test

603
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,299
the cues provided at the time of in
coding

604
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:35,230
if they're rich enough

605
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,159
they can compensate for

606
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,170
impoverished activity

607
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,520
onsite accuse provided the time of
retrieval if they're rich enough can

608
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,249
compensate for impoverished activity

609
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:49,960
at the time of encoding

610
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,130
similarly

611
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,179
if you wouldn't get a journal lots of
processing at the time of retrieval

612
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:59,780
in gauge of lots of elaborate in
organizational activity

613
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,250
when the time to but wild at when the
time comes for retrieval you don't have

614
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,080
to do too much

615
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,870
more effort you put into encoding

616
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,580
fell less effort you need a retrieval

617
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,859
the less effort you put into encoding
for more information

618
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:19,039
you quality uwm uh... need for retrieval

619
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,940
and this general idea

620
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,669
that there is all and interaction or a
kind of compensatory relationship

621
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:28,090
between and coding

622
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,120
and retrieval

623
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,030
is very important property of the memory
system

624
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,430
not studied something very well

625
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,520
you might do ok on a recognition testing
of multiple choice test but you're not

626
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,039
going to do very well

627
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,499
on a_d_r_ on an essay exam

628
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:46,070
on youtube engaged in what the box

629
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,590
well elaborate encoding activity

630
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:54,320
or you don't need that he helped over
recognition test the ancient

631
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,070
greeks and romans

632
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,360
people who didn't have a lot out paper
available to go to them

633
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,360
maybe use of these kinds of principles

634
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,690
wednesday or when they were preparing

635
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,639
they're all of their speeches for
example in the are greek agro

636
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:12,800
or the or the roman forum

637
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,669
is very common if you look at worli

638
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:19,330
or rather ancient of texts are rhetoric

639
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,560
to find

640
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,640
on speakers

641
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,419
being taught aid mnemonic device

642
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:29,839
known as the method of low side all by
which they are stalled supposed to in

643
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,220
code

644
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,559
the points that they want to make and
their speeches in such a way as to make

645
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,210
it easy for them to remember them later
on

646
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,499
so for example if i were using the
method of low side

647
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:46,979
to altered to memorize this lecture on
might say ok we're going to begin with

648
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:51,430
the principle of time dependency and an
associate that with pullman holt

649
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:55,220
and then we're going to so i think about
the principle of interference and an

650
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,200
associate that with the valley life
sciences building

651
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,650
and we're going to think about the fan
effect on going to put that in the

652
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,250
chancellor's office in california hole

653
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,630
and now i'm going to take the occu
dependency principle

654
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,750
and i'm going to associate that with
we'll arrive at four a_m_ and now if i

655
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,580
want to

656
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,190
remember

657
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,830
what my lectures going to be about

658
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,210
all i have to do is mentally retrace my
path

659
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,470
getting from my office in pullman hall

660
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,190
over to your real wrote a trim

661
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,500
and pick up those points along the way

662
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,799
if it was in fact

663
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,649
house cicero and all other roman orders

664
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:32,030
memorized the speeches they didn't have
a lot of paper

665
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:36,150
they didn't have them cargo on marble
slabs of the hold them up in front of

666
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:36,950
them

667
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,220
all-weather read their work

668
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,220
they used man demonic tricks like the
method of low side

669
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,200
part make it easy for them to remember

670
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,019
the points that wanted to make

671
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,850
in the order in which they wanted to
make them

672
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,620
these demonic devices

673
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,690
all

674
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,290
involved setting up

675
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:59,159
various kinds of strategies at the time
of encoding

676
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,049
to make remembering

677
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,140
easier

678
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,220
the time haldol

679
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,170
at the time of retrieval

680
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:14,080
so no let's do another memory test in
that blast list but i presented to you

681
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:21,080
what were the liberals are women's first
names don't look on your slides

682
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,780
number that list

683
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,840
and talking about it

684
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:35,840
thirty minutes or so

685
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
amber

686
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,159
anybody named amber

687
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:40,820
usually get at least one amber

688
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,580
these days nobody mister anyway

689
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,340
all

690
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,120
members are perfectly good

691
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,870
goals or woman's first name any of you
probably know somebody named amber

692
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,170
all

693
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,970
when you started this list

694
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:58,600
you studied it in the congress party the
word amber in the context of all other

695
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,199
color names

696
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:01,720
orange and purple

697
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,360
u_n_ coated with the word amber

698
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,320
as a color name which in fact it is

699
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,450
but then when i ask you to retrieve that
word

700
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,500
uh... yesterday uh... center to did to
retrieve it

701
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,809
as a grills or woman's first name

702
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,390
and it was for

703
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,680
now that word is their you remember all
everybody remembers that word now is a

704
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,850
lawyer at the time

705
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,370
one how come you weren't able to arm

706
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,140
how come you were able to get at it

707
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,919
this dog difficulty remembering amber
okay

708
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,019
depending on how it's uncoated

709
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:40,419
illustrates what's known as the encoding
specificity principle

710
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:43,860
and this is another example of the
relation

711
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,830
between encoding processes on the one
hand and retrieval process he's on the

712
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,770
other

713
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,450
what the encoding specificity principal
basically says

714
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,480
is that memory is best

715
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,789
when q information presented at the time
of encoding adept at the time of

716
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,380
retrieval

717
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,660
matches

718
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,809
q information processed at the time of
encoding

719
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:09,919
memory is best

720
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,640
when the cues

721
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,129
presented

722
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:14,950
at the time of retrieval match

723
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,330
accused

724
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,490
that were processed at the time of
encoding

725
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,740
and codeine advertiser color name

726
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,540
makes it easy to remember amber as a
caller word

727
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,769
but makes it hard to remember amber

728
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:29,580
as egg rolls

729
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:34,400
all of them go all the girls were
balloons or first name

730
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,370
this principle of encoding specificity

731
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,659
is what accounts for

732
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:45,160
some of the most fascinating phenomenon
of memory white state dependent memory

733
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,459
we now know that if you were very

734
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:52,700
the person's physiological state by
giving them drug

735
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,640
on one occasion and maybe not at another

736
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,309
that memory will depend

737
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,580
on the match

738
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,600
between the individuals physiological
state at the time of retrieval

739
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,509
and that individuals

740
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:07,570
physiological state

741
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,330
at the time of encoding

742
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,869
also for example

743
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:14,230
if the person is

744
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:14,900
drugged

745
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,090
or did and it's given no drug at the
time of retrieval

746
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,290
and no drug at that paula and also no
drug at the time and coating memories

747
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,320
pretty good

748
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,080
but if the individual was audited coated
the information under the influence of

749
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,980
case psychoactive drug

750
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,950
and then tries to retrieve the
information

751
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,180
after the drug is washed out of the
system

752
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:42,030
memory is going to be worst if the
person and coated in the non drugs state

753
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:46,700
trying to do is drug during retrieval
again memories going to be pretty bad

754
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,489
all but

755
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:50,419
if the individual encodes during

756
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:52,830
paula paula dot thought the drug state

757
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,659
and then tries to retrieved during a
broad st

758
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,059
memory is going to be pretty good

759
00:33:58,059 --> 00:33:59,739
pretty good by say

760
00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:06,130
because it turns out that almost all
psychoactive drugs impeller

761
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,210
encoding and retrieval process needs

762
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,550
okay whether it's alcohol

763
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,399
or

764
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,759
substances that you're not supposed to
be taking like marijuana

765
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:18,980
although or all of those psychoactive
substances

766
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,899
impair

767
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:24,379
memory processes both at the time of
encoding and at the time of retrieval

768
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:27,590
but if you look at samal doses of these
drugs

769
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:31,349
you will find all of that there is a
pattern of state dependency

770
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:32,959
so if you win coated

771
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:34,289
the in information

772
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:35,850
under the influence of a drug

773
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,410
you'll remember it better

774
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,809
if you are also

775
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,410
under the influence world

776
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,609
that drug

777
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:43,840
again just so i'm not misunderstood

778
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,559
this doesn't mean that you should study
with a bunch of beers

779
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,590
and then come in

780
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,649
for a mid-term exam

781
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:52,889
okay

782
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:57,209
because alcohol impaired as many
functioning right

783
00:34:57,209 --> 00:34:59,930
alcohol impairs both encoding and
retrieval

784
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,210
but in the laboratory were beacons to
where we have a good study these things

785
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,570
safely under tight control we go we've
we've been able to show

786
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:12,049
that subjects who studied with a little
buzz on

787
00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:15,999
remember better if they also remembers
but they also retrieved

788
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:21,179
with a little are both on here is an
example of this is an experiment by

789
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:22,420
jim swanson

790
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,320
and marcel cans barn

791
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,369
classic study all of drugs state
dependent memory

792
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:32,139
in children with all attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder

793
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:34,769
august those on early study of the drug
ritalin

794
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:39,660
i'd add fadiman type drug which has
paradoxical effects than

795
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,050
or kids with the d_h_ the all uh...

796
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,069
of the to what come down and focus

797
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:48,060
and what happened in this experiment

798
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,589
was that swanson kids born ask these
children

799
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:57,359
learn a list of facts they were actually
the locations of zoo of animals and

800
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,599
their resumes

801
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:01,160
but tiger arisen that are rondo losing

802
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,750
that campbell is in the citizen the all
regina zoom these kaiser canadians

803
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,630
okay

804
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,150
saw the kids

805
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,379
studied one list all the words

806
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:13,599
under the influence of berlin

807
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,359
and

808
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:15,239
date

809
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,239
although they're not a group of kids
study out without the influence of

810
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,119
ritalin

811
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:20,919
and then

812
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:23,310
they were given a relearning test

813
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,239
okay

814
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:27,930
always ritalin or without ritalin

815
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:32,219
and this is the percentage of errors
salawah errors means better memory

816
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:33,229
you can see

817
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:37,769
there when the children lower nd list
under the influence of drugs

818
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:39,160
of ritalin

819
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,569
the showed fewer errors and rewarding

820
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:45,619
and when they wrong

821
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:48,840
all learned of the list under the
influence of no drugs

822
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,440
they showed fewer errors

823
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,310
when they relearn under the influence of
no drugs this is a classic pattern

824
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,540
or drug dependent memory

825
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,359
are just happens to be children with a
p_h_d_ but it was traits the point

826
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:04,309
if you've got its eighty h d

827
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:06,220
and you learn something

828
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:06,990
when you've

829
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,910
kutcher does of ritalin

830
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,790
you'll remember it better

831
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,070
if you're also

832
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:15,220
all working on your does volvo

833
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,109
overload

834
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:20,239
so they are not a number of these
drug-induced state dependent memory

835
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,359
effects that have been observed in
humans

836
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:25,979
we get the strong affects with very
strong drugs

837
00:37:25,979 --> 00:37:27,339
barbiturates

838
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:29,359
easter nitrous oxide

839
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,369
you can get some affects with nicotine

840
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:34,449
just another reason not to smoke

841
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:37,699
right don't smoke or your study cuz it
can't smoke in here when you're taking

842
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:39,359
an exam

843
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:40,560
all

844
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,189
marijuana hallucinogenic give moderate
state dependent effects

845
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:44,979
all

846
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:48,760
there some other drugs to give
relatively weak affects but these

847
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,180
all major sedative drugs

848
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,900
can produce very strong state dependent
affects on memory

849
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,079
all it's not just a matter of

850
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,140
drabbed affects on memory emotional
state can also produce

851
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,720
all effects on nov or the state
dependent effects on memory

852
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,009
here's an experiment by eric i can janet
metcalf

853
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:11,950
in which

854
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:17,609
all subjects were made happy or sad
while they studied a list of words

855
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:23,029
this was all by virtual musical mood
induction although i can metcalf played

856
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:24,940
very happy techni music

857
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,619
for half their subjects you know

858
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:33,349
r_v_ overture to the ballet giselle was
one of their uh... tunes very very nice

859
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:34,859
happy music

860
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:37,409
can't be said was that his l

861
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:38,219
palm

862
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:40,179
the uh... the other group of subjects

863
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:44,219
were played music that paul that was
intended to make them said

864
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:45,150
all

865
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,329
moves toward skis russia under the
mongolian boots

866
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,309
okay

867
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:51,500
plated half speed

868
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,990
this is really directly saying this is
all four piece of music not occur great

869
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,119
piece of music played at full speed

870
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,550
all but in any event

871
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:03,170
the subjects were given this musical
note induction barbie stories list of

872
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,130
words

873
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,369
and i've never given a musical mood
induction when they attempted to

874
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:11,509
remember at the list of words they had
studied some subjects were happy in both

875
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:16,849
conditions somerset in both conditions
somewhere happy while they studied sad

876
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:20,440
will be retrieved somewhere said while
they were still while they studied

877
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,630
on and unhappy with the retrieved

878
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,260
and what you can see here is

879
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,779
that the match between encoding mood

880
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:30,029
and test mood produces

881
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:31,370
the best memories

882
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,650
if you're happy

883
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,840
when you encoded

884
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,030
you remember more if you're happy at the
time of retrieval

885
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,250
if your sad when u in code

886
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,540
you remember more if you are said

887
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,420
at the time

888
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,670
all retrieval

889
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,840
so here's a guy another example

890
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,840
of this encoding specificity principal
as it applies to emotional state not

891
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,059
just drug state

892
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,869
here's another illustration of the
encodings festival specificity principal

893
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:05,390
applying to environment the environment
in which encoding and retrieval occurred

894
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,060
this is an experiment by garden and
battery

895
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,679
that was done with palm

896
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:16,329
deep-sea divers these in fact were navy
seals being trained as part of the naval

897
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:18,529
base in the in san diego

898
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:20,410
quite an extraordinary experiment

899
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,520
died in battle we talk about our bunch
of these guys

900
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,290
and our

901
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:28,269
all had some of them study a list of
words while they're on the dock

902
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:30,720
and then drive to adapt the twenty five
feet

903
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,729
and remember the list of words

904
00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:34,250
on deliverable subjects

905
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,520
dole to adapt the twenty five feet
struggle is the words like

906
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,639
held out this list of words in front of
their masks

907
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,960
all that and then came up to the surface

908
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,160
and were tested

909
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,439
and you can see

910
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:48,050
that if u studied on land

911
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:51,049
you remembered better if you are tested
on land

912
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:52,940
if you studied underwater

913
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,339
you remembered better if you were tested
underwater

914
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:59,820
bum match between the incumbent
environment

915
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,690
and at the retrieval environment

916
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,850
makes a difference

917
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:06,610
if the retrieval environment matches the
encoding environment you get better

918
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,960
memory

919
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,160
if their is a

920
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,380
mismatch

921
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:16,420
so what we've seen here all four bunch
of examples of what's known in the field

922
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,809
as context dependent memory

923
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:20,759
okay

924
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:22,419
why do you define

925
00:41:22,419 --> 00:41:24,700
context in terms of time

926
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,829
workplace

927
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:29,150
features of the external environment
like whether you're on the broader

928
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,419
lander twenty five feet under water

929
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:35,489
features of the internal environment
like your physiological state controlled

930
00:41:35,489 --> 00:41:36,680
by drivers

931
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,269
or your emotional state or whatever

932
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:42,929
dark to my knowledge there are no
studies of motivational state dependent

933
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:43,679
memory

934
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:46,829
but you can imagine experiment in which
people study a list of words while

935
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:51,589
they're hungry and then test or tested
while they're hungry i bet dollars to

936
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:54,659
doughnuts you get the same kinds of
facts

937
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:58,059
though i suspect that hunger or also
interferes

938
00:41:58,059 --> 00:41:59,100
and coding

939
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,379
on and uh... and retrieval

940
00:42:01,379 --> 00:42:01,980
still

941
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,509
what we've got here

942
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:06,099
is in the encoding specificity principle

943
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:08,089
what kind of limitation

944
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:10,929
on the q dependency principle

945
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:16,069
q dependency principles said basically

946
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:17,639
what matters

947
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:21,639
to accessibility what matters at the
point of retrieval is the informational

948
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,019
value of the retrieval cue

949
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:29,149
more information supplied by the
retrieval cue the more likely you are to

950
00:42:29,149 --> 00:42:31,229
gain access to a memory

951
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:34,029
now it's true so far as it goes

952
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:34,749
but these

953
00:42:34,749 --> 00:42:39,069
the these studies illustrating the
encoding specificity principle

954
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:40,099
make it clear

955
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,369
that it's not just a matter

956
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:46,630
mt of information it has to be right
claim

957
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,239
of information

958
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:50,029
all

959
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:54,709
the information supplied at the time of
the retrieval

960
00:42:54,709 --> 00:42:55,810
has to match

961
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,230
the information that was processed at
the time of the coding

962
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,030
if you're going to have

963
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:05,259
very successful or retrieval conditions
so and coating

964
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:07,240
how you would call it a memory

965
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,900
sets the stage brook hart you're going
to retrieve it

966
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,890
if you encode amber as a color word

967
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,699
they're going to find it difficult to
retrieve amber as a girl's first thing

968
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:18,930
similarly

969
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,109
retrieval

970
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:21,400
in some sense

971
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,589
recapitulate

972
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:27,159
the encoding process ok so you've got to

973
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:29,260
do with the title retrieval

974
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,720
engage in the at the time retrieval on
the same kinds of process easy win

975
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,500
gauged in

976
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,699
at the time oven coding

977
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:40,660
when encoding and retrieval conditions
are kanga runs

978
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,529
backed increases the likelihood that
you're gonna gain access to trace

979
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:45,880
information

980
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,769
when encoding and retrieval conditions
arkin timberland

981
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:50,730
that's going to make it

982
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,400
a lot kal a lot harder

983
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,229
so

984
00:43:55,229 --> 00:43:57,629
that's the story bobo

985
00:43:57,629 --> 00:43:59,180
encoding specificity

986
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,609
and at the eliminates all

987
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:02,099

00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,729
anne questions on encoding specificity

990
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:14,729
mu dependent memory

991
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,039
last time we talked about this principle
of encoding

992
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,779
that says that

993
00:44:22,779 --> 00:44:24,359
the elaboration principle

994
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:25,890
the basically says

995
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:31,010
that more you connect new information up
with pre-existing knowledge

996
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:33,969
the better the memory is going to be

997
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:36,510
again that's true so far as it goes

998
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,349
but there are interesting called by
their qualifications

999
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:43,109
on on this

1000
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:47,199
let's look at that point the
relationship is between knowledge

1001
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:49,479
gerald allege and memory

1002
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:51,980
here we're talking about the influence
of

1003
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,909
will be called semantic memory

1004
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:55,250
in the last lecture

1005
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:59,999
your generic abstract knowledge and
beliefs about the world

1006
00:44:59,999 --> 00:45:01,770
and you're at the thought of memory

1007
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:03,579
your memory for a particular

1008
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:04,599
or experiences

1009
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:06,299
they want to know what the relation is

1010
00:45:06,299 --> 00:45:08,039
uh... between these

1011
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:14,269
here is all that experiment all using a
variant on the verbal learning paradigm

1012
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:18,669
known as person memory paradigm in which
we ask people to

1013
00:45:18,669 --> 00:45:20,359
study and remember

1014
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:21,119
facts

1015
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,659
about or love facts about people

1016
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:26,179
in this experiment

1017
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:29,289
we first

1018
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:34,929
present person with setup general fax
about an individual like a judy

1019
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:37,749
we simply say to his intelligent

1020
00:45:37,749 --> 00:45:39,339
she's surfaced

1021
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:45,569
she's artistic she's refined she's a
magid itive she's witty note the kind of

1022
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:46,690
person

1023
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:47,700
this is

1024
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,619
okay so that's your general impression
of judy

1025
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:54,569
and now i'm going to tell you some facts
about her life

1026
00:45:54,569 --> 00:45:57,519
okay

1027
00:45:57,519 --> 00:45:58,439
sheet

1028
00:45:58,439 --> 00:46:01,259
one the chess tournament

1029
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:05,939
second she attended a symphony concert

1030
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:09,509
judy made the same mistake three times

1031
00:46:09,509 --> 00:46:13,869
she was confused by the daytime
television show

1032
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:16,639
judy ordered a sandwich for lunch

1033
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,430
and judy took the elevator

1034
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:21,550
to the third floor these are the kinds
of facts about judy

1035
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:25,099
we want you to remember in this
particular experiment

1036
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:29,059
but point of having you learn something
about judy in general

1037
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:32,179
was to establish i kind of ski you know

1038
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:33,999
oriflame work

1039
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:38,619
but you can use to encode information
about judy

1040
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:40,709
and if you noticed for a second

1041
00:46:40,709 --> 00:46:43,490
some of these behaviors are kanga relent

1042
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,600
with the schema

1043
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,450
she won the chess tournament and she
attended the symphony concert so kind of

1044
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,339
thing you'd expect all smart

1045
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:55,039
artistically sensitive sophisticated
people

1046
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:58,869
some of these behaviors more in
congruent with the impression you have

1047
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:00,450
about dog judy

1048
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:05,569
she made the same mistakes vetoing this
let's kind of a dumb thing

1049
00:47:05,569 --> 00:47:08,590
she was confused by the daytime
television show

1050
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:09,819
another

1051
00:47:09,819 --> 00:47:11,489
dumb thing to do

1052
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:13,180
these are inconsistent

1053
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,869
with your impression of this person as

1054
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:19,630
intelligent witty sophisticated on
sensitive and all that

1055
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:21,520
and then there are these behaviors like

1056
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,009
she ordered a sandwich for lunch

1057
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:26,470
and she took the elevator to the third
floor

1058
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,109
breach of shrug your shoulders in

1059
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:31,159
doesn't have anything to do with it if
we don't know about judy

1060
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:32,410
we have

1061
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,880
behaviors that are

1062
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,549
congruent

1063
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:37,189
with your schema for judy

1064
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:39,659
congruent with your overall impression
of judy

1065
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:44,109
some that are in cumberland with your
overall impression of judy and some that

1066
00:47:44,109 --> 00:47:45,839
are simply irrelevant

1067
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,569
to your overall impression

1068
00:47:47,569 --> 00:47:48,420
of judy

1069
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:53,170
and now what we do is we tester memory
for these three different kinds of facts

1070
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,819
and will be kept is a pattern of results
that looks like this

1071
00:47:57,819 --> 00:47:59,270
memory is best

1072
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:02,189
for schema conger on fax

1073
00:48:02,189 --> 00:48:03,720
memory is best

1074
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,109
doesn't talk there is going to christina
conklin fax okay

1075
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:12,619
as opposed to schema irrelevant facts
soul remembering that judy went at went

1076
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:15,680
to the symphony concert that's
remembered pretty well

1077
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,980
remember that remembering that judy
ordered a sandwich for lunch

1078
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,299
remembered not so well

1079
00:48:20,299 --> 00:48:22,779
but what's interesting about this
experiment

1080
00:48:22,779 --> 00:48:25,539
all is that memory is best

1081
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:27,080
for schema

1082
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,989
income grew and fax

1083
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,739
memory is best for the fact that judy

1084
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:34,410
was confused by the daytime television
show

1085
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,539
and the jury made the same mistake

1086
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:37,719
three times

1087
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:39,839
what's going on here

1088
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,020
walker illustrated in this experiment

1089
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,319
is the relationship between

1090
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,069
memory for a particular offense

1091
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:51,159
and knowledge of all the world in
general

1092
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:54,180
and it's a band of memory for particular
bad

1093
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,750
depends on its relationship

1094
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,759
to your knowledge of the world in
general

1095
00:48:58,759 --> 00:49:00,319
here we have what's known as

1096
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,149
the schematic processing principle

1097
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,740
which basically says

1098
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,480
that memories of function

1099
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,289
of the relationship between an event

1100
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:14,099
and pre-existing knowledge expectations
and believes

1101
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:15,729
memory is very poor

1102
00:49:15,729 --> 00:49:17,969
for information that's irrelevant

1103
00:49:17,969 --> 00:49:21,699
to pre-existing knowledge expectations
and beliefs

1104
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:22,249
better

1105
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:24,980
for indictment for information that is

1106
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,630
kanda relent

1107
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,360
with existing knowledge expectations and
believes

1108
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,969
but it's best

1109
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:32,089
for information

1110
00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:37,539
in congruent with existing pre-existing
knowledge expectations and beliefs and

1111
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:39,389
here's what's going on here

1112
00:49:39,389 --> 00:49:41,469
give you give me one minute

1113
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:43,109
dusky no

1114
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:48,219
medellin judy is intelligent and
sophisticated insensitive

1115
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:53,069
that provides you with additional treat
all information q information but you

1116
00:49:53,069 --> 00:49:58,499
can use the search memory for
intelligent sophisticated artistic kinds

1117
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:01,529
of facts about judy

1118
00:50:01,529 --> 00:50:06,919
schema conroy knowledge is favored in
memory because the schema provides

1119
00:50:06,919 --> 00:50:11,319
additional q information at the time of
retrieval

1120
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:16,489
schema in congruent behaviors get a
different advantage in memory scheming

1121
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:21,649
in congruent behaviors get advantage in
memory precisely because they are

1122
00:50:21,649 --> 00:50:23,719
surprising and unexpected

1123
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:28,399
and when you encounter something that's
surprising an unexpected you think about

1124
00:50:28,399 --> 00:50:30,180
you try to explain it

1125
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:34,999
why would somebody as smart as judy be
confused by the daytime television show

1126
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:38,759
well maybe she was thinking about to all
of the nobel prize she was going to get

1127
00:50:38,759 --> 00:50:43,799
tore law manish focusing on proving
formats last their arm or something like

1128
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:45,159
that

1129
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:51,259
the explanation provides more
opportunity to wall operate the event in

1130
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:56,709
memory provides you an opportunity
moored to process at a bit more deeply

1131
00:50:56,709 --> 00:51:02,219
steamer content promotion gets the
advantage of retrieval cues schema in

1132
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:06,869
congruent information gets an advantage
from elaboration schema irrelevant

1133
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:12,929
information gets another advantage
schema irrelevant thought information is

1134
00:51:12,929 --> 00:51:14,679
poorly remembered

1135
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:15,939
thank you very much

1136
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:18,359
at a good weekend will finish this up on
monday
