i've got some accommodation notices for
his students in the d_s_p_ program but

8
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:33,280
if there are any others that i should
have

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,040
gotta get those to me as soon as
possible so we can make the appropriate

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,090
on arrangements

11

the exam as announced will cover all
required reading some lectures to date

so the introductory resolve lecture and
quite mins chapter one

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,440

behavior in playthings chapters two and

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,180
three

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,990

and glickman's chapters four and five

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,440
we will not be having questions on the
statistical appendix on this exam

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,730
but we will have some questions

20
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,180
on that material

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,610
on the final

22
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,940
exam

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,460
there are lots of resources for the exam
as mentioned there's going to be a

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,330
review and our class on monday

25
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,040
all of the jia sides are not going to
temp to covered all the lecture material

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,980
or all the textbook material

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,219
but they will be here and available to
answer any

28
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,800
gault less than a questions that you may
have

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,890
the study guide for the globe in text is
pretty good

30
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,710
all a very good guide to

31
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,310
not only the uh... content of the exam
but also the style of questions whiteman

32
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,980
was one of my teachers

33
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,000
like like to think i think like he does

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,440
along

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,540
there a lots of materials on the course
website there lecture supplements there

36
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,920
are copies of past exams

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,010
all of which with the answers most of
which with some analysis

38
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,610
in addition if you have any last minute
questions ready questions at all

39
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,320
or if you post them to the forum on the
corps on the block or so of course

40
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,989
website

41
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:12,700
by noon on tuesday

42
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,550
either rider the geoscience will all

43
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,769
do our best to get a response to you

44
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:21,390
are backed by the end of business
birthday okay so there are lots of

45
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,689
things

46
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:24,379
available

47
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,289
on the exam format slice of the class
dictates multiple-choice testing but

48
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:30,680
even if we did that the dead and will
probably do it

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,110
'cause multiple-choice tests of the best
s

50
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,170
their objective

51
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,409
they're reliable

52
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:39,489
there's no worry about whether the g s
all i was tired when he or she was

53
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:40,879
reading your exam

54
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,369
or whatever

55
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:46,249
on the just pages run through the
computer and dog that's it

56
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,900
all roughly half of the questions are
drawn directly from the lectures roughly

57
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,109
half were drawn from the text there's
overlap

58
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:54,380
all make sure

59
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,489
that you come to class with the proper
red scantron form

60
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,689
which you can buy your ta as you see
bookstore and other venues around campus

61
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:03,809
i know they are

62
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,429
let's have the right pat brown's grill

63
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:09,949
and bring a couple of number two pencils
because you can fill these things in the

64
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:10,649
bank

65
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,709
you've got a filament

66
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:16,950
this is what the scantron form looks
like this is the front

67
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,240
this is the back i've already got an
example of that on the narrative

68
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,039
i'll review that i all posted to the
course website

69
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,309
but if you have any doubts

70
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:31,139
one year there were two different red
scantron forms

71
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,390
all of this is the one

72
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,389
it's about four or by

73
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,629
eight or nine or something like that
that's the front

74
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:40,969
the uh... that's the back

75
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:45,650
all focus of the exams as always is on
basic concepts and principles

76
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,209
at this level of the course for just
trying to give you some appreciation of

77
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,040
how your minds work

78
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,469
also they're not going to be questions
about the key details at least i don't

79
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,109
think they're picking details

80
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:58,769
qualm

81
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,139
i took the exam the other night

82
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,199
i passed

83
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,930
of

84
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,020
we also don't ask you about specific
experiments

85
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,080
however i might naman investigator all
might refer to an experiment as a way of

86
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,010
helping you retrieve the basic concept
of principle that's associated with that

87
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,169
experiment ok so if i talk about
garcia's experiment on taste aversion

88
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,459
learning tougher stand it should go off
in your head is

89
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:30,099
the arbitrariness assumption and the
preparedness principal if i ask you if i

90
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:33,839
could ask about caymans experiment on
the block in effect buff first thing

91
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,280
that you go off in your head is

92
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,990
alm association by contingency

93
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,639
and predictability in surprise okay
that's how that works

94
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,520
so we want to recommend recognize the
implications of studies

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,800
but we don't need you to memorize
studies

96
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,370
themselves

97
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,800
okay ought that's pretty much all i have
to say about the exam for now any

98
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,500
questions about

99
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:04,500
format of the exam yes

100
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,580
know the statistical appendix that
you're not going to be responsible for

101
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,580
on the midterm

102
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,509
is the appendix it's in the back of the
book

103
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:21,590
but it was assigned in the readings for
the introductory lectures along with

104
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,439
chapter one

105
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,260
it's in the back of the textbook

106
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,889
all appendices always in the back of the
textbook

107
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:34,589
so if it's not on the exam i wouldn't go
looking for it right now

108
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:37,830
i don't worry about the statistical
appendix for now

109
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,500
you'll have plenty of time to worry
about it

110
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,349
farm anything else about the exam yes

111
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:47,479
at the issues the bookstore

112
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:48,310
okay

113
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,270
all or there were other places around
campus site

114
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:58,270
when i go getting a bunch of pat brown
squirrel i see them at the cashiers

115
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,059
fifty

116
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:05,059
okay dot that's appear

117
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:10,059
ok anyway it's fifty

118
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:14,759
and that's probably doable in the fifty
minutes you've got okay

119
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,550
armstrong

120
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,469
just get here get settled in

121
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:21,699
pass out the exams take the exam turn in
the exam

122
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:22,199
phone

123
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,970
and that

124
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,909
all bombeck shore

125
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:28,050
you keep a record all of your

126
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,479
answers on your exam for you don't turn
in the exams you just turn in the

127
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:32,929
scantron forms

128
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:33,860
because

129
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,960
right after the exam the our preliminary
scoring key will go up and you can check

130
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,689
your answers

131
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:45,699
okay immediate feedback good
psychological principle of learning

132
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:50,050
anything else about the exam

133
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,239
okay if you have any other questions we
can catch them up on wednesday or just

134
00:06:53,239 --> 00:07:00,239
post into the course website

135
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,689
okay last time we talked about some
basic phenomenon of learning

136
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:08,780
and one of them major

137
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,169
earth thrusts of those lectures

138
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:16,210
wires that were in a man's not just a
matter of what changing behavior

139
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,490
bringing behavioral responses

140
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,740
onto the control of various
environmental stimuli

141
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,139
rather we want to think about learning
in terms of a change in the knowledge

142
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,860
that an organism acquires new knowledge
about the world

143
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,729
that at the very least

144
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,889
animals that to predict and control

145
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,539
what's going to go on and its
environment

146
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:45,289
that's true for the dogs and cats in the
riots and rabbits usually used an animal

147
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:46,539
condition experiments

148
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:49,349
but it's even more true

149
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:49,929
humans

150
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:54,729
we understand now that human beings are
cognitive beans

151
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,300
our behaviors

152
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,979
go well beyond

153
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,440
mere associations between stimuli and
responses

154
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,419
we do a lot more than reflex taxes

155
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,340
instinct

156
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,870
conditioned responses

157
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,330
instead our behavior is based is
intelligent

158
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,069
it's based on our knowledge about the
world

159
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,910
and so what we have to do

160
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,900
if we're going to understanding havier

161
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,980
is we have to understand hollow

162
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,849
organisms

163
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:25,929
specially humans acquired knowledge

164
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:27,810
paul would stored in the mind

165
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,189
how it's used in various ways

166
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:34,219
and how it's communicated to other all
other people

167
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:37,610
and that's what cognitive psychology is
all about

168
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,490
what we're going to be talking about for
the next dong

169
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,570
for the next many weeks uh... in this
course we want to know how organisms

170
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,850
specially humans

171
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,560
acquire information about the world

172
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,660
store it

173
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,250
and communicated

174
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,670
and the first step in that process is
acquiring knowledge about of the world

175
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,030
for me mental representations of
ourselves

176
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:06,270
for me mental representations of two
things that we experience

177
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,319
and then

178
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:09,660
on making use of those representations

179
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,600
in various ways

180
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,780
this cats that question that has been a
devil philosophers for our couple of

181
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,680
thousand years

182
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,460
all which is to say how is it that we
know the world how is it that we are

183
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,580
quite that we get knowledge about the
world

184
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,120
and in full of sooty at least

185
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,100
all the philosophical responses to this
question philosophical answers to this

186
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,800
question boil down to

187
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,870
one of two answers

188
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,730
there's a group of philosophers known as
nativist

189
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,490
who argued that

190
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,310
our knowledge is innate

191
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:52,050
that it comes to us independent of our
sensory experiences into the were born

192
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,820
going

193
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,200
everything

194
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,940
we're going

195
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,819
to uh...

196
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:56,370
to know

197
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,930
and at the r_d_ contrary point of view

198
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,500
is what's known as empiricism

199
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,490
and basically the idea behind empiricism

200
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,570
is that knowledge is acquired through
experience

201
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,110
or through our reflections on experience

202
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,320
now we now know that there are certain
forms of knowledge that actually already

203
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,350
in eight all language was technologies
in some important cincinnati we now know

204
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,320
that

205
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,009
but by and large

206
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:28,010
fault scientific psychology

207
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,270
comes down on the side all the
empiricism

208
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:36,620
the idea that most of what we know about
the world we know by virtue of

209
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,820
experience

210
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,940
especially sensory experience

211
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,449
and that's why

212
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:44,549
all psychology has spent so much time

213
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:45,960
trying to figure out

214
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,370
hollow sensation and perception

215
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,540
let's first make though some elementary
distinctions between sensation and

216
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,580
perception

217
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,760
sensation

218
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,040
asks enhancers are basic

219
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,670
very very simple question

220
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,460
the job of sensation

221
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,540
is simply to detect the presence

222
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,290
all of us on the

223
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,050
object or event

224
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,870
the environment

225
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,720
basically sensation answers a question
of

226
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,409
is there something out there

227
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,710
okay

228
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,330
alm

229
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,740
when i see you by sensory mechanisms are
detecting the presence

230
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,210
of you in the environment

231
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,060
and almighty center mechanisms also tell
me

232
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,910
there's a lot of you

233
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,540
so sensation basically says is there
something out there

234
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,790
and how intense

235
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,320
okay very very very simple questions

236
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,700
perception the next stage in the
information acquisition process

237
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,670
tries to answer some much more
complicated questions

238
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,190
where is the object

239
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:59,170
is it in the left of the right as an
awkward and as it near or far

240
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,880
what what is it doing is it's static is
that movie knows that bending his rigid

241
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
and finally what i did

242
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,200
what's the identity of this object

243
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,490
what category of objects does it belong
to

244
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,839
all blocked all are it's all dictate
capacities what can it do to me

245
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,739
and not

246
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,010
any less important

247
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,750
what can i do with it

248
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,989
so sensation

249
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:23,850
the tax

250
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,450
the presence of an object in the
environment

251
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,500
perception

252
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,260
identifies and categorize is that object

253
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,880
forms the mental representation of the
object

254
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
which is the knowledge of the object

255
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,629
we have

256
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:38,860
in our minds

257
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,650
we can see of a little bit better i
think the relations between sensation

258
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,170
and perception

259
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:50,590
if we examine what i'd like to call the
basic vocabulary of sensation and

260
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,890
perception

261
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,840
or which is

262
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,630
uh... vocabulary that cludes

263
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,250
distal and proximal stimuli

264
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,210
and track instruction

265
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,110
the dust all-star annulus

266
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,060
is the term that we use

267
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,579
to refer to

268
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,850
any object or event

269
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,150
that occurs in the environment

270
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,650
fiscal stimulus is any object or event
that occurs in the environment you're

271
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,660
all distal stimuli to me

272
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,360
uh... your

273
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,330
smiling faces your attorney in paper

274
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,950
rear coffee in all that stuff

275
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,500
art distal stimuli

276
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,190
approx little stimulus

277
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,920
refers to the energy the pattern of
energy

278
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,449
is evident by the

279
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:35,980
distal stimulus

280
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,980
and falls on my sensory receptors

281
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,410
sold for example

282
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,660
although if i had that there's a tree in
my environment

283
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,599
that tree

284
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,709
all people reflects light

285
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:51,890
and that light falls on the retinas of
my arms

286
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,689
fault if the tree is

287
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:57,970
blowing in the wind it's going to
russell it's going to make some noise

288
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,470
those sound waves

289
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,210
or remitted by the tree

290
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,590
and they fall on the alone dot on my
dears

291
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,100
if i'd catch

292
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,340
the tree

293
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,040
but texture of its bark

294
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,160
the smell a bit like a bit so eucalyptus
tree or a pine tree or whatever it might

295
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,180
take a bite out of it the taste of the
tree

296
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,420
all of that stuff

297
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,809
dot that though that those

298
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:27,090
notice of the proximal stimuli that
impinge on my sensory all mechanisms

299
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,030
so the testosterone it was is the object

300
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,209
proximal stimulus is the pattern of
energy

301
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:37,979
that is re radiate order reflected by
the object

302
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:40,560
that falls on my sensory receptors

303
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,370
and it's the job of the sensory
receptors

304
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:48,080
to perform trans duction

305
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,120
transduced or transform

306
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,100
stepped proximo stimulus

307
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,730
into a pattern of neural impulses

308
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:03,059
the rods in clones in the rep moby ait
take a light waves and transform

309
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:03,670
transduced

310
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,600
light waves into

311
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,220
on dural impulses

312
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,259
the basilar membrane and the cochlea of
the year

313
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:11,690
take sound waves

314
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,269
and transducers at

315
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:18,610
into or pattern of electrical impulses
so okay

316
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,610
all of that

317
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,079
is what

318
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,250
sensation does

319
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,590
taking a proximal stimulus

320
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,120
repudiated via distal stimulus

321
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,290
transduced into into a neural impulse

322
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,389
which is then transmitted

323
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,759
all bio various afferent nerves into the
cortex of the brain

324
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,540
at which point

325
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,570
perceptual processes take over

326
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,960
to inform on mental representation

327
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,330
all but

328
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,860
distal stimulus

329
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,850
a mental representation

330
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,259
of the tree and image if you will of the
tree

331
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:55,369
that exists in my mind

332
00:15:55,369 --> 00:16:00,320
that represents paul or depicts if you
will on the tree

333
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,760
that's outside

334
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,940
are both the physical features of the
trees at paula's at shaw ridges that

335
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,250
green doesn't have leaves on it or
whatever

336
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,279
and also

337
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,060
the home beyond the meaning of the tree

338
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,150
perception

339
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,149
forums this mental representation

340
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,609
an adult life is that

341
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,529
so that i don't defies

342
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:20,920
and categorize is

343
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,310
the object

344
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,060
so no the question is

345
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,670
how do we get

346
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,190
from the stimulus to the percept

347
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,760
how do we get from the pattern of
stimulus energies radiating off the

348
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,030
distal stimulus

349
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,370
transduced into a pattern of neural
impulses

350
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,930
sent to vote for various call cortical
sites in the brain

351
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,139
or create a mental representation

352
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,629
of that distal

353
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:51,029
or stimulus

354
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:54,500
one important view of this process

355
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,430
one take if you will on this process

356
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,740
is known as the ecological view of
perception

357
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,140
and it is our associated with two
psychologist a husband and wife team at

358
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,620
cornell university

359
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,439
both now gone unafraid james j gibson an
owner jack gibson

360
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:14,150
jimmy and jackie

361
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,090
gibson

362
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:19,340
are very very very famous very important
perception psychologists

363
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,160
all who gave us this ecological view

364
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,449
what they did the sims argued

365
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:29,120
was it that way we get from sensation
perception

366
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,290
the way we get from

367
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:39,110
distal stimulus in the environment why
it's called the ecological view okay

368
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,769
presided for the percept are occurs
because

369
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,520
every statement was

370
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,520
provides all the information you need to
perceive the object or event in the

371
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,800
environment

372
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,820
every stimulus

373
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,799
provides all the information needed for
perception

374
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,610
and what perception involves

375
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,320
is extracting this information

376
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,660
from the pattern ald

377
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,500
stimulus energies from the pattern of
proximal stimulation

378
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,039
that falls on sensory

379
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:14,770
of on on the center receptors

380
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,629
another name for the ecological view is
direct

381
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:19,700
perception

382
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,950
sometimes called directory elizabeth
moore usually called direct perception

383
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,710
and again

384
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,629
it's called direct perception

385
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:29,100
because within the gibson's view

386
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,700
everything you need to perceive the
world is supplied by the world itself

387
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,260
supplied by the distal stimulus

388
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,970
and the pattern of proximal stimulation

389
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,100
falling underwritten on your row center
receptors

390
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,519
and there is no need

391
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,980
for any kind of

392
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,640
so called a higher cognitive activity

393
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,809
there's no need to make inferences

394
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:55,100
there's no need to make use of judgment
of memory that stored in your mind

395
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,269
already

396
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,380
nothing's you already know about the
world

397
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,300
no need to or

398
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,620
to engage in any kind of problem solving
activity

399
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:08,670
all the information you need for
perception is supplied

400
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,720
the home

401
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,029
by the stimulus

402
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:12,780
itself itself

403
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,950
and it turns out

404
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,059
this is a very powerful viewer
perception

405
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:18,460
it kind of culture

406
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,170
for are a lot

407
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,669
of how perception works

408
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,480
it could account for

409
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,300
it you know as you'll see in a minute
forth the basic principles of depth

410
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,650
perception

411
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,959
answering the question

412
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:34,340
is the object of perception nearer to me

413
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,460
close at hand

414
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,390
or is it

415
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,570
away

416
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,490
the ecological deal can also

417
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,070
our count four

418
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,440
most of motion perception

419
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,930
answering the question about

420
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,600
the distal stimulus

421
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,320
is the object

422
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,090
stable in the environment

423
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,500
or is it

424
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,950
moving around

425
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,730
and finally

426
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,090
olympic candle account for what's known
in the trade as the perception of

427
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:01,900
plasticity

428
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,310
which just says is the object rigid

429
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,289
isn't flexible

430
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,279
in various kinds of ways

431
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,740
what i'm going to do

432
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,229
all used to demonstrate the ecological
view a perception

433
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:15,970
by focusing in depth perception

434
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:21,310
but your textbook lightnings text has a
very nice account of motion perception

435
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,920
along similar lines

436
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,590
not so much on the of on the perception
of all plasticity

437
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,100
on a typical perception course you'll
get allot of that

438
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,010
so again

439
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,830
what the ecological viewer perception
says

440
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,520
is that if you want to know rarely
object is

441
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,009
what it's doing

442
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:41,910
and what it's basic form is

443
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,560
the object itself

444
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,809
the enviroment itself supplies all the
information that you need

445
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:53,390
all for this song of for this purpose
but there is a trek

446
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,170
in the ecological view

447
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,769
and it's one that's important to
understand

448
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:00,969
and that is that the ecological view

449
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,330
defines the stimulus

450
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,590
very broadly

451
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,950
to include not just the object that
you're looking at if i'm looking at one

452
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,049
of you

453
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:11,440
okay

454
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,370
you're the distal stimulus invited in by
sensory field

455
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,210
but so is everything else

456
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:16,950
okay

457
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,620
so the idea here

458
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,720
all the information needed for
perception is supplied

459
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,530
body

460
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,820
this dog by the distal stimulus but
thing you're looking at

461
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,900
but also by the surrounding the stimulus
field

462
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,770
all the context

463
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,289
that surrounds

464
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:36,539
father at object

465
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:41,520
although basically or the environmental
context i'm looking at one of you

466
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,649
everybody else in the room such errors
everything else

467
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:47,570
of while provide some of the context

468
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,650
and also

469
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,190
information from my own body

470
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,309
as you'll see

471
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:57,050
or in a minute provides some of the
stimulus information needed for

472
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,100
perception but the idea is that

473
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,590
it's also in the world

474
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:06,280
everything you need for perception is
provided by the stimulus environment

475
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,110
provided that you define the stimulus
environments

476
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,860
broadly enough to include both the
object of regard

477
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,140
and its context

478
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,450
both information in the environment

479
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,940
and information

480
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,940
deep receivers

481
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,530
let's see how this works

482
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,360
when we look that

483
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,100
perception of distance

484
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,820
how do we know

485
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,340
whether their called whether an object
that we're looking at

486
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,470
is close to was

487
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,679
far away

488
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:38,040
it turns out

489
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,050
there are a number of cubes

490
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,200
provided by the stimulus environment

491
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,880
that do a very good job of telling us
whether an object izmir or or far away

492
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,350
and

493
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,820
one of these cues

494
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,170
is known as convergence

495
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:59,650
it's a but we call the binoculars q for
the perception of distance because this

496
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:05,140
is a cue that requires that we have two
lines

497
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,730
doesn't work if you've only got one i
look at it cover one are you up

498
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,540
you lose

499
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,540
the convergence cues

500
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,460
and the convergence q

501
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:18,330
basically comes from the fact that when
you focus your rise on an object

502
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,050
you're always turned inward

503
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,920
okay

504
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,700
also if i'm focusing on you here my eyes
are turned inward

505
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:31,040
if i'm focusing on you back there my
eyes or returned

506
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,700
but if you think about your work cut
high-school sophomore geometry for a

507
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,480
second

508
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,510
it turns out

509
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,700
at the angle of convergence is different

510
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,610
when you're focusing your eyes on a
nearby they object

511
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,960
then if you're focusing arise on an
object

512
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,909
far away

513
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:53,459
so that the angle of the two vectors the
angle created by the vectors the eyes go

514
00:23:53,459 --> 00:23:55,049
into the object

515
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:58,779
indicates is a very good indicator of
distance for up for you

516
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:00,929
thirty or forty feet

517
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:02,070
here's the diagram

518
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:07,020
that shows that this is the case here
are two wise

519
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,220
converging onto wa objects

520
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,839
object they won

521
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,130
and object eighty two

522
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,490
and you can see

523
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,690
that if the eyes are focused are
converging on this nearby object to

524
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,220
anyone

525
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,350
the angle of convergys is relatively
large

526
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,970
if the eyes are focusing on this

527
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,900
relatively far away object

528
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,670
paid through

529
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,399
the angle of convergence is relatively
are small

530
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:36,820
so you jeff depth information

531
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,200
because you get feedback from the
muscles of the arise that tells you

532
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,070
whether the angle of convergence is a
big angle or a relatively small angle

533
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:53,150
big angled means the object is nearby a
small angle means the object is far away

534
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,909
so here is a cute to distance

535
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,120
cute in depth

536
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,700
that's provided by the stimulus
environment that we haven't talked about

537
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,440
the white waves radiating off the object
yet

538
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,070
a stimulus environment

539
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,570
but summa signals information has been
provided by by own body

540
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:17,119
that is the muscles in my eyes or
sending feedback to my visual system

541
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,759
about the angle of convergence that
provides information as to whether the

542
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,440
object is close

543
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,940
here is another q

544
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,549
alm

545
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:34,500
that paula is also a binoculars q for
the perception of distance this is known

546
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,870
as the retinal disparity

547
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,740
it's also sometimes called binoculars on
disparity

548
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,360
and it comes from the fact

549
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,800
that your eyes are separated by a
distance of about couple or couple of

550
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,920
inches

551
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,480
and by virtue of the fact that your two
eyes are separated by a distance of a

552
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,960
couple of inches

553
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,760
each

554
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,969
alrighty receives are somewhat different

555
00:25:57,969 --> 00:26:00,320
image of the object

556
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,860
in question

557
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,639
and so what happens is

558
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:06,560
these to slightly different

559
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,230
two-dimensional images

560
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,910
which are on the retinas of the allies

561
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,030
are then diffused into a
three-dimensional image in the brain

562
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,770
but basically the idea is

563
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,710
all of the more disparity

564
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,020
or less disparity

565
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,120
is a q

566
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,899
for the perception of distance it's
actually the fact

567
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:27,429
that each on receives a somewhat
different

568
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:28,880
your view of the object

569
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,999
that produces

570
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:31,009
the of

571
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:32,029
the illusion

572
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:34,500
all of a lot of seeing things and depth

573
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,780
here is a demonstration

574
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,390
on here you've got

575
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,830
you're left died

576
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,540
and you're right on me

577
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,560
and you're looking at these three
objects

578
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,010
object death is far away

579
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,929
object he is in the middle object c is
all it is very close

580
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:56,480
and what you can see here

581
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,840
is that each of these are key to these
dogs ripple retinal views

582
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,240
is a little bit different

583
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,820
okay and then

584
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,950
ubu individual when the two images or
sent to the visual system

585
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,289
they are or their fused into

586
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:15,500
here is that there is an example of this
just do this is a demonstration

587
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,760
hold your left

588
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,300
index finger a full arms-length

589
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,700
okay

590
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,669
hold your right index finger

591
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:24,330
at half alarms length

592
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,920
and close your right on

593
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,990
closer right on

594
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,830
now align your two fingers using your
left on him

595
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,539
so that both of them coincide with the
cross

596
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:38,150
okay do that

597
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,300
now having done that

598
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:47,300
close your left aryan open your right
away

599
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:52,399
your each of your lives gets a somewhat
different view of these objects okay

600
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,020
and it's the disparity between them that
helps to create

601
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,370
on image of the world

602
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,750
enough in-depth

603
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,880
okay so we've got now these two
different views

604
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,330
convergence

605
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,029
and retinal

606
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:08,620
disparity

607
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,980
there are other accused for the
perception of distance

608
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,710
that are not binoculars in nature

609
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,739
but instead are more documentation or

610
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,649
meaning that they all do require that
you have what i

611
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:27,649
if you close one eye you still get this
information about depth and distance

612
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,790
one

613
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,920
molecular q for all for depth or
distance is known as accommodation

614
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,740
and this q reflects the fact that when
you will focus on an object

615
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,750
lands of you're alright changes shape

616
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:49,099
if you focus on an object that is nearer
to you

617
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:53,080
your lens has to bolger gets that

618
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,350
and if you focus your eye on an object
that is distant

619
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,820
full lens will stretch out

620
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,970
flattened

621
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,539
again

622
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:08,780
this accommodation is produced by a
muscles in the army

623
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,280
okayed the federal way itself is
produced by muscles of the special

624
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,710
muscles in the eye

625
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,450
and these muscles send feedback to the
visual system

626
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,480
that tells the visual system

627
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,040
whether there

628
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,730
flatly both ends

629
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,480
making a bulge in the lens

630
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,279
in order

631
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,750
too

632
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,820
in order to

633
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,590
bring the object into focus

634
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,910
here is the diagram of that we've got to
whites here

635
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:39,029
and we've got an object that is close-up

636
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:43,019
here is the lens of the are you can see
it's become a little bulge

637
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:44,820
inept back here

638
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,580
and hear you've got an object that is
relatively far away

639
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,970
and when the i_e_ focuses on that

640
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:56,210
the lens has two planes just like you
and all like a projector for example or

641
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,530
two or as a sort of some cameras

642
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,279
all you have to do so uh... something
very similar

643
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,040
but again the point here is that there
are muscles

644
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,149
doing this bulging and flattening

645
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:09,919
they provide feedback to the visual
system

646
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,450
that's part of the stimulus environment

647
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,490
this is the information that's coming

648
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,909
from the body of the perceive ur

649
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:18,190
in the same way

650
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,909
that the angle of convergence

651
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:23,350
columns from the body of the

652
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,930
perceive her

653
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,510
case all accommodation is one such

654
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,200
so-called mon ocular q for the
perception of distance

655
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,380
here's another one very good q for the
perception distance known as relative

656
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,420
size

657
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:43,380
and this relative size occu basically
reflects another aspect of geometry

658
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,529
known as the the size

659
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:47,120
distance rule

660
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,620
if you hold

661
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,540
the distance

662
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,639
between the observer and turn wild
checks

663
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:56,580
constant if you hold the distance
constant

664
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,929
the size of the object

665
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:01,600
will be of of will be

666
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,690
directly control the size of the object

667
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:08,150
of that the of the image that the object
tests on the retina

668
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:14,169
so object size will be a function of the
image size if you hold distance constant

669
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:17,210
if you hold side is constant

670
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,230
aldrich distance

671
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,330
is a function of

672
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,779
the embers of the image size

673
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,789
if you hold size constant

674
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:27,610
on target that far away will cast a
smaller image on the road no

675
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,350
than an object that's of clothes if you
hold

676
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:35,009
distance constant large objects cast a
large

677
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:36,480
image on the rattler

678
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,580
small objects cast a small image on the
bottom of the retina

679
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,679
if you hold size constant

680
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,210
close objects

681
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,440
a large image on the retina

682
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,650
distant objects

683
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,870
cast a small

684
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,909
all image on the road

685
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,190
so you could take this information

686
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,960
about the relative size of of of the
rebel images

687
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,169
and that is information about

688
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:02,110
uh... about distance

689
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,820
good example of this comes from

690
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,039
professor palmer's of dot book here we
have a dolly

691
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,030
and we have to trees

692
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,780
a close-up three

693
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,210
and a tree that's far away

694
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:19,809
the image all the clothes tree

695
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:21,580
is larger

696
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:25,420
then the image

697
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,559
tree okay

698
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,490
so when u

699
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,789
seat this is what the rebel image of
those trees would look like you see but

700
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:35,539
one triple larger image

701
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:37,560
are closer to you

702
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:43,670
the of them smaller image relative size
is an important q

703
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:48,850
distance if we have to objects that are
pretty much the same size

704
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,740
the one that passed the larger image on
the retina

705
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,239
is going to be closer

706
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:54,190
than the one

707
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,040
the tests

708
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,520
the smaller

709
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,340
on the road

710
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,899
so relative size

711
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:01,679
is another q to distance and

712
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,790
it's eight mode ocular q you don't need
to wise to get this q

713
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,150
all you need is one i

714
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,299
onto to have retinal image

715
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:11,440
rebel size

716
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,580
if u to distance

717
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,380
here is another

718
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,160
more doctor weir queuing for the
perception distance

719
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,370
known and superposition

720
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,050
and superposition simply refers to date

721
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,190
obvious fact

722
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,520
obvious ones to think about it for a
second

723
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,419
that nearby objects

724
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:30,840
will call it off

725
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,190
views of more distant objects

726
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,630
all you have more distant

727
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:38,030
from u than this podium and at the
podium

728
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,400
cuts off

729
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,290
your view of me cause sits in front of
me right

730
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,880
science looks very simple but it's a
profound q

731
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,200
i know move infront of the podium

732
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,900
and you know one closer to use in the
podium is because no one blocking your

733
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,530
view of the podium

734
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,529
superposition

735
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:03,620
is a very powerful q_-two distance it's
something cuts off

736
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,429
your view of something else

737
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:08,220
then obviously it's closer to you

738
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,309
then that other raj ect is

739
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:15,639
this is a cue that artists have used at
least since the medieval period

740
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,919
to or to depict distance

741
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,369
and it's also a q

742
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:22,069
that artists can have some

743
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:24,639
here's an example

744
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,320
just kind of schematic example of
superposition

745
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,259
you see the orange

746
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:30,439
won't block

747
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:31,280
closer to you

748
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,270
than the green blocked because the
orange q cuts off your view of the green

749
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,409
or square

750
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:43,409
here is a painting by the french
surrealist painter renee migrate in-car

751
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:44,169
plunge

752
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,509
in which he

753
00:34:45,509 --> 00:34:49,189
playin swept the superposition q for
distance

754
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:52,099
woman riding a horse through a forest

755
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:57,019
this tree cuts off your view of the
horses hind quarters

756
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:00,229
this tree cuts off your view of the
woman

757
00:35:00,229 --> 00:35:01,410
but the woman

758
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,860
cuts off your view artistry

759
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,590
and of course is four part

760
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,840
cuts off your view

761
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,980
of this tree picture that doesn't make
any sense okay as a depiction of the

762
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,459
world that doesn't work

763
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:19,949
but it's although i'm by screwing around
with a superposition q for distance okay

764
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:23,549
i'm a greater safety autolearn this
culinary arts school

765
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:27,709
and look what i could do with that i can
make this really interesting painting

766
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:31,499
all of that you know the more you look
at it the autre it looks

767
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:34,839
and it's or because the distance
relationships

768
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:37,420
between the horse and writer on the one
hand

769
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:44,209
and the trees on the other hand have
been home have been played with

770
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,740
so superposition

771
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:50,180
is all is another one of these important
to all accuse

772
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,329
another when ocular cupid a perception
distance one that

773
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:59,119
began to be used in painting in a
renaissance art and is now a very very

774
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,260
important in realistic painting

775
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,709
is linear perspective

776
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:06,090
and the idea behind linear perspective

777
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:09,990
is that when objects are arranged in
linear perspective

778
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,309
are there are perspective lines

779
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:13,769
that conver

780
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:16,089
torrid a valuation point

781
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:19,550
and all jokes along those lines or

782
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,319
of for shortened or accordingly

783
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:27,589
on here is a mix of famous example
apiece renaissance art raphael school of

784
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:29,209
aphids

785
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:29,959
aristotle

786
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:32,849
socrates bunch of other people

787
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:36,169
all used to be able to name them all
can't do that right now

788
00:36:36,169 --> 00:36:37,910
all pointed at the event

789
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,650
notice what's happening here

790
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,809
you see

791
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:42,649
these people

792
00:36:42,649 --> 00:36:43,119
closer

793
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,150
to you

794
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,779
this person somewhere in the middle

795
00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:48,250
these people

796
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,750
forever alway

797
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,430
and then in the distance

798
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,839
this arch way behind them

799
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,339
unit this is a a canvas this is a
two-dimensional painting of course but

800
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:01,800
you see add asst three-dimensional
singing

801
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,890
and the reason you see it as a
three-dimensional singing

802
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:10,580
is that raphael has carefully
constructed these images saw all along

803
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:15,580
all along perspective lines here's our
kind of rough and ready analysis of the

804
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,269
painting

805
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:17,989
if you follow

806
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:22,959
these lines from the tops of the columns

807
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:24,079
down

808
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,100
you see they converge right here in

809
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,469
dead center in the center of the
painting

810
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:31,429
if you take phone lines

811
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:34,970
suggested by that tiling in the floor
here

812
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,119
and follow them write-up again they
converge

813
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,710
right in the dead center

814
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,969
of the painting and then

815
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:43,109
various objects

816
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:44,089
are now

817
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:45,350
for shortened

818
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:48,150
as you move along the perspective lines

819
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,959
so here's a character here

820
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:51,969
person and white

821
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,119
who is about

822
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,049
toll

823
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:58,729
and hear is onto

824
00:37:58,729 --> 00:37:59,719
authorities okay

825
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:02,460
who is painted as shorter than that

826
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,410
about how we work

827
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,530
if you were that far away along the
prospective lines

828
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,839
here's a person in the middle

829
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:09,419
and

830
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:13,539
that's well thong behind it that figure
is somewhere inbetween

831
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:15,419
the height of the speaker and the height

832
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:16,799
of that figure

833
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:20,059
these perspective lines when you talk
art in

834
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:20,930
grade school

835
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,730
they taught you to do this right cannot
draw these lines you know i've been told

836
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:29,800
make sure that everybody is arrayed all
along them this is a doubt that uh...

837
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,419
technique that was basically discovered
in the fourteenth century

838
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:38,009
people didn't know about it before the
fourteenth century and it's been used

839
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:38,979
ever since

840
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:40,269
to depict

841
00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:41,780
that and distance

842
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,729
in the home

843
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:45,180
into dimensional space

844
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:51,039
and it turns out that our visual systems
use the same kind of information

845
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,380
what i'm looking at you no especially
from looking down this road

846
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,920
i get this nice perspective line the
converges back there are a little bit

847
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,099
people up here

848
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:02,719
you're pretty big

849
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,860
people back there

850
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:08,090
your pretty little right and it all fits
together all but with a full of the

851
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:12,430
regular for shortening along the all
along the prospective lines

852
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,280
so linear perspective

853
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,489
very very important to you

854
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:18,170
although

855
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:22,749
wrote again since the renaissance at
least painters have tried to paint

856
00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:23,510
scenes

857
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,310
as if

858
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,589
you were looking at the scene

859
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:31,109
through our window on the frame supplies
that window here is our painting by

860
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:34,199
marguerite that all basically

861
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,950
salt blob of plays on this principle

862
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,579
on you've got it

863
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:39,499
canvas

864
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:40,659
island evil

865
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:42,339
it's a canvas of the field

866
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,100
with you treated it

867
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,310
and notice that this shrubbery here

868
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,529
is continuous

869
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:49,679
with the shrubbery that your view

870
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,180
the window

871
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:51,700
again

872
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,789
all of those artists with views

873
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:54,550
cues like

874
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,879
all than your perspective to create the
image

875
00:39:57,879 --> 00:39:58,940
the painting

876
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,790
is just what the world would look like a
outside

877
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,559
if you were looking at it

878
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:05,539
e window

879
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:08,970
here's another example of a great way to
do this

880
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:12,980
on uh... mine but these titles are the
he was a surrealistic titles don't have

881
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,269
anything to do with the painting

882
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:15,830
alm

883
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,799
but you can see again here is the easel

884
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:20,130
here's the canvas

885
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,530
there's a cluster of houses here

886
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:26,059
in the painting we have the horse cart
and most of the house

887
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:27,690
little bit of shrubbery here

888
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,380
but it's continuous with

889
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,319
the rest of this on comic readers

890
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:32,920
lighting up

891
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,460
his perspective lines

892
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,809
so was to create delusion

893
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,449
that you're looking at the world

894
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:42,209
the window

895
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:43,459
canvas

896
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:47,090
here it is another migrate love
marguerite don't you

897
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,150
on the promenade suv euclid

898
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,249
all work the greatest on something very
interesting

899
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:55,729
with altman with the lines of
perspectives so here we've got another

900
00:40:55,729 --> 00:40:58,529
these all another tenders right at the
scene

901
00:40:58,529 --> 00:41:00,009
what do you know the window

902
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:00,960
there is this

903
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,089
are tolerant here with the conical our
top on a condom

904
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,069
disneyland

905
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:06,919
power

906
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:09,950
and then there is this long boulevard

907
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,199
receding are receiving them to the
distance

908
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,890
you can see here clearly

909
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,799
the visual perspective lines

910
00:41:17,799 --> 00:41:19,719
the vanishing point

911
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,220
creating

912
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,920
the law the illusion the that the uh...
the impression

913
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,839
that these houses down here

914
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:28,390
farther away from the viewer

915
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:31,259
than these houses or or or here

916
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:33,019
okay see i was done that

917
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:35,760
notice however that does

918
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,460
conical power top

919
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,949
is exactly the same

920
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:41,199
in shape

921
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,489
and size

922
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:43,279
as

923
00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:44,829
the conversion lines

924
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:46,029
in this boulevard

925
00:41:46,029 --> 00:41:49,549
these are exactly the same shape and
size

926
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:53,099
but you don't see these is converging
lines y

927
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:57,849
because my brief has used the principle
of superposition

928
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,309
get you to see this power as being in
front

929
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:02,959
of this all

930
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,029
uh... that this apartment building

931
00:42:05,029 --> 00:42:07,470
there is no superposition q

932
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,519
on here

933
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:12,969
rather you see these as prospective
lines and the world going out

934
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:16,259
or the distance it's a very charming and
i think illustration

935
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:17,330
of how

936
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,809
all written realistic painters

937
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:20,810
mccree would probably

938
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:24,089
turn over his grave if you've heard
nicole more realistic painter but that's

939
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:26,239
what it is

940
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:28,009
datatable boulevard right

941
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:28,710
all

942
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,790
on to use these

943
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:31,829
accused the depth

944
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:34,500
to communicate on all of the

945
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,540
depth and to represent

946
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,199
depth distance

947
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:42,400
here's another q that's commonly used

948
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,200
elevation

949
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,039
distance from the horizon

950
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,009
when you look out at the world

951
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:53,779
distant objects up here are closer to
the horizon then nearby objects to

952
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,580
just next time you look at the world
check that out

953
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,890
and you'll see that it's true here it is
all dusk a medic depiction of it we've

954
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,719
got a horizon here

955
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,200
we've got a tree here

956
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,600
we've got a tree here on these trees are
the same size

957
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,219
all but you perceive

958
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:12,520
this tree as closer to you

959
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:17,649
that industry distant objects or closer
to the horizon

960
00:43:17,649 --> 00:43:19,729
near by objects

961
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:23,390
here's another example from a professor
plummer

962
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,249
here's an array of trees

963
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:26,839
a horizon

964
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:28,030
some alums

965
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,709
and some clothes

966
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:33,169
and notice that these trees

967
00:43:33,169 --> 00:43:34,520
appear closer to you

968
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,649
than these trees

969
00:43:35,649 --> 00:43:39,719
there closer to be streets are close to
the horizon a pure farther away

970
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:41,539
and that this cloud

971
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:42,460
appears

972
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,410
farther away

973
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:44,789
that these clouds

974
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:49,700
again the clothes closer to the horizon
so it's not a matter of up-and-down ok

975
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,839
thought about urban high on though

976
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,680
the image or lowered the image

977
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,730
it's a matter of

978
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:55,770
where you wore

979
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,849
with respect

980
00:43:57,849 --> 00:43:59,839
horizon

981
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,669
on governor qal from a perception of
distance known as aerial prospective or

982
00:44:04,669 --> 00:44:06,109
atmospheric perspective

983
00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:09,309
and this that this q works because

984
00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:13,929
uh... in the air there are best
particles are sometimes water particles

985
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:16,369
are under liquid particles

986
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:17,470
onto a fraction

987
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,279
the light okay

988
00:44:19,279 --> 00:44:22,069
all and produce the kind of blowing

989
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:24,240
but more distance

990
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,009
there is between you and the object

991
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:33,040
the more cost and water there is in the
error between you when the object

992
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,690
and more willing

993
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,509
all actually occurs

994
00:44:36,509 --> 00:44:39,059
here are two really good examples of
this

995
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:42,709
this is a photograph of the blue ridge
mountains and north carolina

996
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:46,559
one of the reasons the blue ridge
mountains look blue it'll look blue if

997
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,889
you're sitting on a blue ridge about
looks very green cause

998
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:52,639
trees are grain

999
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:55,320
the reason at the blue ridge bones look
below

1000
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,400
is that these all of the chinese on
these moments or a minute ago kind of

1001
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,220
oil

1002
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,199
that alter frac slight in the distance

1003
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:07,400
here's another example the supporter
preferably cottage one

1004
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,089
in guatemala

1005
00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:13,309
and on a close by you see your this
green

1006
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:16,940
and that is to go to his art would look
at the more distant volcanoes

1007
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:21,619
you see the baby turned blue again
that's because even in such a pristine

1008
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,100
environment as we got to climb

1009
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,640
there's still a lot of doston stuff for
the year and that creates gluing of what

1010
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,190
would otherwise be green

1011
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:34,599
but below where it is not for the way it
is to make along the story short

1012
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,040
on these are always

1013
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,849
are good cues on to distance

1014
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:45,179
and finally thickness finally and i
think you've heard dog for a productive

1015
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:46,830
is texter gradients

1016
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,270
and that simply means

1017
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:53,789
that there is more texture apparent in
an object that's close at hand

1018
00:45:53,789 --> 00:45:56,600
then there is in an object that's for a
way

1019
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,420
when i look at you like to see

1020
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,500
kind of into done he reckons he can
individual hairs and things like that i

1021
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,229
could see your shoelaces

1022
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:07,589
what i look at somebody back there i
don't get anything like that i know the

1023
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:10,329
releases on that shoe but i'd just

1024
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:11,509
see them

1025
00:46:11,509 --> 00:46:15,950
on here are some photographic depictions
of this would be seen

1026
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,380
these rocks are closer

1027
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,579
to the observer

1028
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:21,190
you can see a lot of detail

1029
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,850
these rocks same kinda rocks farther
away

1030
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,680
they blur into the distance

1031
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,440
here it is a elva crowd scene of the
football stadium you see a lot of detail

1032
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,880
on here

1033
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,740
in the objects utter farther away much
less so that there is out

1034
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,669
gradient of texture gave a more texture
the more detail you can see the closer

1035
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:44,220
the object all

1036
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,609
host of the objectives

1037
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:47,089
and then finally

1038
00:46:47,089 --> 00:46:49,879
uh... we have are shadowing

1039
00:46:49,879 --> 00:46:50,880
as an index

1040
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,969
to ardent adept

1041
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:54,019
this calmness

1042
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,360
from the fact that

1043
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,860
or visual systems evolved

1044
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,199
in an environment where there was only
one source of light

1045
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:02,859
the sun or the moon

1046
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:04,000
and it was always

1047
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,579
pretty much always over had

1048
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:09,520
when u_n_ evolve a visual system

1049
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,659
in an environment where the source of
light is always overhead

1050
00:47:14,659 --> 00:47:17,190
the pattern of shadows

1051
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:17,790
communicates

1052
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:21,019
dot all of the depth and distance okay

1053
00:47:21,019 --> 00:47:23,599
so here

1054
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:24,459
these

1055
00:47:24,459 --> 00:47:25,980
three circles here

1056
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:30,029
you perceive them as convex you perceive
them as coming out

1057
00:47:30,029 --> 00:47:31,450
all of the screen

1058
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,969
towards you

1059
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:36,619
whereas use block received these

1060
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:38,380
circles as concave

1061
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,109
and dented in to the screen

1062
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:42,479
going away from you

1063
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:44,699
against evil pattern of light here

1064
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:47,660
these are illuminated casting a shadow

1065
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,050
there's a shadow here

1066
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,380
and this is eliminated

1067
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,339
that's an impression that's created

1068
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:53,570
simply by

1069
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,149
hollow polite works you can see this
very clearly

1070
00:47:57,149 --> 00:48:00,529
to flip it upside down

1071
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:03,590
these used to be on the bottom these is
to be on the top

1072
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,329
but no okay

1073
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:10,159
what was once convex is now a concave

1074
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:13,019
as and what was cool what was once
convex

1075
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:17,789
what would what one's concave is no
convex all because of the pattern of

1076
00:48:17,789 --> 00:48:18,319
light

1077
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,019
so dead

1078
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,229
it's the pattern of light radio off the
object

1079
00:48:22,229 --> 00:48:24,889
that communicates

1080
00:48:24,889 --> 00:48:27,319
and what's

1081
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:32,129
so we've got no it's wholesale accuse

1082
00:48:32,129 --> 00:48:34,850
saamne binoculars in nature

1083
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:37,010
requiring tour guides

1084
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:39,079
someone ocular in nature

1085
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:41,599
requiring only one died

1086
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,550
somewhat ocular in nature

1087
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:48,750
because the information is provided by
the always themselves in the muscles

1088
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,799
attached to them

1089
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:54,269
and all others optical in nature having
to do with the pattern of light the

1090
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:59,179
falls on the retinal i'll be all right
these inferred these fused together

1091
00:48:59,179 --> 00:48:59,909
create

1092
00:48:59,909 --> 00:49:02,170
the perception of depth

1093
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:05,339
or distance invasion

1094
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:08,159
as the gibson's whitewater reminders

1095
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:09,690
highly information

1096
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:13,049
if you need to four perception of
distance

1097
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:16,789
is provided by the stimulus itself

1098
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:21,279
provided you define the stimulus broadly
enough to print to include

1099
00:49:21,279 --> 00:49:21,799
figure

1100
00:49:21,799 --> 00:49:24,409
as well as the ground

1101
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:24,839
information

1102
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:26,109
in the light

1103
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:29,699
and information in the muscles as well
information

1104
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:34,160
coming through the perceive ur it
information in the body of the procedure

1105
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:39,479
all the information for perception is
provided by the stimulus

1106
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:40,800
not quite true

1107
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,039
and soul explain on wednesday

1108
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:43,449
thank you very much
