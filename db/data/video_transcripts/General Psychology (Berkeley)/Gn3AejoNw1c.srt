1
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,420
okay let's move into our last set of

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,199
actual lectures

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:16,650
the past weeks

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,279
we've been speaking mostly about mental
structures and processes that underlying

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,169
normal experience thought an action the
kinds of things that

6
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:29,800
ordinary people experience

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,540
in the ordinary course of everyday
living

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,720
we've had occasional

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,590
all

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,750
reference to mental illness various
forms of brain damage and so on

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,040
but what we want to do with this set of
lectures is to examine mental illness it

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,190
its own right

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,589
to try to figure out

14
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:54,260
but the nature of his own abnormal mala
dept of behavior

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,839
the abnormal mental structures and
processes that

16
00:00:57,839 --> 00:00:59,400
that underlie it

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,270
and the kinds of interventions that we
have

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,460
that we can

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,730
art that we can use to treat and to
prevent on mental illness

20
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,330
it turns out however that

21
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:17,370
it's not seek to define mental illness
or psychopathology in the abstract

22
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,329
all but the best we can do is to begin

23
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:26,010
albright analogy to the notion of
pathology in

24
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,470
term psychopathology is actually derived
from the great

25
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,330
first of course

26
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,929
the term psychic psyche psycho

27
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:39,520
along periphery dust storm behind a new
ends in modern scientific psychology

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,320
referring to mental processes and
activities ok and then there's pathology

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,930
all again from the greek

30
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,420
had to do with deviations from mahal
from normality

31
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,030
if you think about medical

32
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,130
illnesses for a moment

33
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,020
cancer

34
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,680
heart disease or whatever

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,920
but you ought to have in every case

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,539
it is either

37
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,770
deviation from merrimack anatomical
structure

38
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,259
or band is broken off partisan built
right along the stone work right

39
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,319
there are deviations from normal
physiology there's some substance

40
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,489
running through the blind risks on the
cell process that's

41
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:21,199
all that's good that that's going all
right

42
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,430
so that's what

43
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,270
medical pathology looks like

44
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,369
and then we think about psychopathology

45
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:32,650
armed again we're going to look at
deviations fred look normal

46
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,179
mental structure and function

47
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:39,819
but again trying to figure out exactly
what means what's meant by

48
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:40,959
normality

49
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,960
turns out to be not as easy in the case
of psychopathology

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,949
as it is in the case of medical
pathology

51
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:50,089
in general

52
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:55,370
when you ask people to define power to
describe what they mean by

53
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,209
normal mental life for normal behavior

54
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:02,020
you'll get almost of definitions of
looks pretty much like this

55
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,410
which you can think of as a kind of
conceptual prototype of psychological

56
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,899
abhorred psychological normality

57
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:14,539
in the first place we generally think up
psychologically mammal people

58
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:15,529
as having

59
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,639
what you think of it accurate any
ficient mental function

60
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,479
to put up a loudly

61
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,099
armed

62
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,579
mag lev people pretty much see the
rabbit

63
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,810
and don't have to wind dot don't have to
go to too much trouble

64
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,170
to do that it's all

65
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:31,870
accurate

66
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,679
and it's efficient

67
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,870
similarly in the air national realm

68
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,759
normal individuals have minimal

69
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,709
all

70
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,649
or national reactions

71
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,030
diverse kinds of events

72
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,750
in the motivational realm

73
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:50,599
their desires their goals are more or
less or or reasonable are given their

74
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,650
circumstances

75
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,069
so that's what we mean by accurate and
efficient mental function

76
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:59,640
basically reminders working the way for
us to work and doesn't have to work too

77
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,069
hard at it

78
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:02,659
by self awareness

79
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,269
well usually mean that an individual is
over

80
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,259
ordered his or her beliefs

81
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:12,720
and desires and feelings or has some
awareness

82
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,420
of what his or her

83
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,180
also or sudden awareness of wat

84
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,679
his or her impact is our mother our
people

85
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,560
on process control

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,409
you generally think of also controls had
to do with

87
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:30,879
of the individual's ability to in do
things like

88
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,009
gratification

89
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:37,919
tolerate frustration make plans and
follow-through on them

90
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,099
by self esteem we generally refer to
apartheid person feels about him or

91
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:44,770
herself

92
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,400
psychologically normal people

93
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,830
usually feel

94
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,939
had about themselves whatever time

95
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,279
sometimes you look at america's a follow
your heart level person

96
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,680
that now's the time

97
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,470
it's a show right you know it's like
that going on saturday night live

98
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,430
fallen

99
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,650
and uh... sexual relations based on
affection

100
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,319
that is on some kind of positive feeling
for the people

101
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,530
with whom you're in iraq and we're not
just talk about the friends and

102
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,360
girlfriends here

103
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,690
we're talking about

104
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,909
passes and subordinates neighbors and
all of that kind of thing

105
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:21,060
onslaught relations based on a faction

106
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,370
as opposed to social relations based on

107
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,409
manipulation or art competition or
whatever

108
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:31,700
and then finally we generally think are
psychologically normal people

109
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,599
as latino less productive lives

110
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:39,729
being able to lobby metalworking able
make a living in being able to do areas

111
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:41,030
kinds of things

112
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,949
and

113
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:46,129
are having some degree of creativity and
their lives as well

114
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:50,610
now by creativity we don't mean you have
to be our stravinsky or a beethoven or

115
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,580
out

116
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,990
or a picasso or something like that

117
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,080
devising a new way to know

118
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,629
organizer shopping list

119
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:03,449
are coming up with a new plays are not
in their in soccer or something like

120
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:04,180
that

121
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,569
is of the day is an example of kind of
everyday on everyday creativity

122
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,940
as divides and i think i've just
indicated

123
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,830
it's not so easy to the following these
subordinate features of normality either

124
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,550
but when you start talking about
normality you begin to get people

125
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,409
talking all on all of these lines

126
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:26,329
and if you're going to define

127
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:31,729
psychopathology as deviance threaten
mental abnormality

128
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:34,700
once you've got some sense of what you
mean bag normality

129
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,280
the next thing you have to do

130
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,590
is to figure out what it is that you
mean by

131
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,180
deviants

132
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,490
and now it turns out

133
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,009
not to be so easy

134
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:45,280
so for example

135
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,469
we can think about deviance

136
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:53,469
in statistical terms ok applying the
what is sometimes flat out as the

137
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:56,449
frequency criterion offer deviants

138
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:01,669
and basically what we say here is
everybody is too far from the average

139
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:05,869
we're going to look at it as
statistically deviant

140
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:10,500
if your state to smell into standard
deviations of barbara below the average

141
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,780
for some kind of all of the ban on some
kind of quality

142
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,370
we're going to think about all of you as
home as being

143
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,949
psychologically abnormal in that respect
and of course

144
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:27,750
abnormality or have to be statistically
infrequent ok abnormalities

145
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,909
statistically frequent

146
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:33,319
that it's not clear what abnormality
means of anymore but they do have this

147
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,960
problem with an application of
statistical norms all word which is let

148
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,709
me go to a positive about positive
deviations

149
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,229
think about

150
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,309
are measured intelligence so-called i_q_
for a second

151
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:50,990
all we define individuals who are
mentally retarded

152
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,870
as those

153
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,669
who were all that have

154
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:57,469
i_q_ scores more than two standard
deviations below the mean

155
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:00,699
mean as one hundred on the work for
adult intelligence kale

156
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,789
got a standard deviation of fifteen

157
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:05,280
so people don't like use less than
seventy

158
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,719
we begin to think about as falling into

159
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:11,969
a category of mental illness known as
mental retardation

160
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:13,650
but the asians co-op

161
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,560
as well as die alone

162
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,820
if you have an i_q_ to standard
deviations above the mean that is a blow

163
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,479
up about one thirty

164
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,759
we have a special label for that cold
genius organiser technical definition

165
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,080
of a genius somebody who's like he was
above hundred and thirty

166
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,649
home

167
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:32,479
all part

168
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,020
it's not clear but you want to classify
geniuses as mentally ill

169
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,220
just because strike you scores are
statistically infrequent just because

170
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,439
they

171
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,739
deviate from normality

172
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:51,370
or the and and and and some statistical
way

173
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,530
alm yes you can define solved although
psychological deviant statistically in

174
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,870
terms of

175
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,520
infrequent

176
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,620
uh... would have been infrequent
characteristics

177
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,420
but you have to deal with the problem

178
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,470
of positive deviations

179
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,229
similarly

180
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:11,579
you can define psychological deviance in
terms of departures

181
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:13,870
from social norms

182
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:20,870
all in the trade this is called applying
a compliance criterium

183
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,850
the the definition of psychological
deviance

184
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,740
and the idea here is

185
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,620
that normal people ought to be able to
comply with prevailing social

186
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,559
norms on him but

187
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,319
people who are psychologically abnormal
either can't do that or have a lot of

188
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:42,870
difficulty doing that or don't want to
do it all oral or whatever

189
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,090
and again we would expect the people who
are psychologically normal

190
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,989
have the ability to confirming their
behavior

191
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:55,279
to altered to prevailing on norms

192
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,529
off but there are good their apartment
at some additional problems that come up

193
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:01,430
when we try to reply you

194
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,360
all of this compliance criterion

195
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,030
to the diagnosis of mental illness but
first of these is that there's a

196
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,970
tremendous amount of variance across
cultures

197
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,440
in terms of what is considered
appropriate behavior

198
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,160
if u greed somebody in the fall european
culture

199
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,090
the manuel negative gradient somebody is
different but if you greet some body in

200
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,410
certain middle eastern cultures of for
example do things in the middle east but

201
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,769
you wouldn't do in the netherlands

202
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,390
and you do things and netherlands but
you wouldn't think about doing

203
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,480
all it in the uh... in the middle east

204
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,950
all work for that matter charter japan
or or or anyplace else about picking on

205
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,000
any particular

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,220
they're real the world here

207
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,890
that's just a lot of areas across
cultures

208
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:55,190
so or dot loggers that that creates a
problem with some with all

209
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,330
of the

210
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,130
compliance criterion

211
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:03,130
whose culture are you going to reference
the compliance to almost over

212
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,790
but there's also a variance involved in
northbrook

213
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,220
social norms

214
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,389
across time within cultures i think the
probably the clearest example

215
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:16,420
all of this with respect to our mental
illness

216
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,170
is homosexuality

217
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,589
when i was undergraduate for that matter
when i was a graduate student which is

218
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,749
not all that many years ago

219
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:27,390
on nineteen seventy to nineteen seventy
five

220
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,149
for the first couple of years in net dot
in that period

221
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,080
homosexuality was defined as a mental
illness

222
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,319
you could go to

223
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:40,019
the diagnostic and statistical manual of
the american psychiatric association

224
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,350
and find homosexuality all in their on
has a uh... at as a form of

225
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,380
psychopathology

226
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,970
but in nineteen seventy three the
american psychiatric association changed

227
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,370
its mind

228
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,470
literally took a vote

229
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,110
all of the association

230
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,740
and decided that homosexuality wasn't
going to be quite policy trolley per se

231
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,260
wasn't going to be classified as a
mental illness any longer

232
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,699
and they did that because the culture
had changed and it was very clear

233
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:10,819
that there were lots of bhargava lesbian
people out there who were perfectly

234
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:14,580
normal in all respects except for their
sexual orientation

235
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,200
and just because

236
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,730
boys like boys and girls like girls was
no reason to classify that as a mental

237
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,629
illness on any longer

238
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,940
but that's not true and other cultures
okay

239
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,460
all again homosexuality may be something
that is abnormal in some cultures

240
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,749
not in or others

241
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:35,300
it's with within a particular culture

242
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,880
abnormal at one time not and all other
or not it another time

243
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,130
warner perhaps the most difficult lol

244
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:50,130
dramatic example of how you can simply
blindly apply a compliance criterium

245
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:56,320
onto our deviation from social norms to
determine who is mentally ill and who

246
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,370
all isn't

247
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,690
our third criterion that people try to
use to the following the park without

248
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,920
the psychopathology or mental illness

249
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,050
there's a criterion all personal
distress

250
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,440
it's a subjective criteria it's the kind
of criteria that you would counter

251
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,440
when somebody goes to a psychotherapist
and says

252
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,529
on dr

253
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,760
i'm realtime really depressed

254
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,490
and i don't want to be depressed

255
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,740
well i'm really anxious and i don't want
to be anxious

256
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,000
on help me

257
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,880
arguably a pillar give me some
psychotherapy or figure out what all the

258
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,070
help me figure out what's wrong

259
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,410
alter onto one

260
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,430
to will

261
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,420
or did you get this thing

262
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,170
and it's true

263
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,820
that most people are this mentally ill
people are distressed by their mental

264
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,480
illness

265
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,019
in the same way that most

266
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:50,799
physically ill people are distressed or
by their illness

267
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,160
but it's not necessarily are the case

268
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,970
again in psychopathology

269
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,790
we'd rather station between

270
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,529
true different kinds of

271
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,040
pathologies or two different kinds of
symptoms

272
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,870
ego symphonic symptoms

273
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,950
and you go to stunning symptoms eagle
simply refers to the self here

274
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,830
indigo symphonic symptoms

275
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,490
thematic the malad active behavior or
the malad active thought pattern or

276
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,129
whatever

277
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,610
is perceived by the person

278
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,230
as a normal part of his or her
personality

279
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,260
here she isn't

280
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,690
at owners everybody else

281
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,950
but it doesn't bother the person who

282
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,270
has the other those who has the problem

283
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,249
all whereas ego to stomach symptoms

284
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:40,550
are the kind of i was talking about
before

285
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,709
or a person says

286
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:44,170
are more depressed than i ought to be

287
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,220
on more anxious than i ought to be are
not thinking clearly any longer or or or

288
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,910
whatever

289
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,940
egos despotic symptoms

290
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,660
bother the individual who has these
particular symptoms

291
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,620
armed

292
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,210
personal distress park right although
the criterion for a psychological

293
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,380
deviance

294
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,760
so long as you're dealing with a goat
historic symptoms like a anxiety and

295
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,619
depression but they may not work they
will not work

296
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,320
or when the person displays ego

297
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,660
symphonic all symptoms

298
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,890
or

299
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,110
alone

300
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,700
deep

301
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,650
the symptom itself

302
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,210
person perceives as part of his or her
own

303
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,310
or personality

304
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,990
they could be a roommate for a second

305
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,310
your roommates got something that just
others that have a lot to you

306
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,350
and he thinks it's flying

307
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,900
he said don't do that anymore so what do
you think would be this is fine that's

308
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,950
the kind of

309
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:43,340
deaf distinction we have between the ego
symphonic and ego despotic symptoms

310
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,880
and then finally but we try to along

311
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,179
try to define psychological deviance

312
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:55,610
we often apply a criterion of now
adopted in this or harmful knows

313
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,220
the persons

314
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,650
mental illness

315
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:02,950
very often will lead him her to be haven
such a way

316
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,690
that is harmful

317
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,110
to him or herself

318
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,080
or to what other people or at least
increases the risk

319
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,940
of harm

320
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,930
part of the person himself or of or to
others

321
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,190
and again

322
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,960
often

323
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,280
ul

324
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,760
then behavioral problems that stem

325
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,749
from of the from mental illness

326
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:28,730
that are harmful to sell for others were
these potentially also

327
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,570
for example some people who are very
depressed maybe at increased risk for

328
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:39,370
suicide that summer is obviously harmful
alot to to self but you wouldn't want to

329
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,210
have harmful must be

330
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,390
amin necessary criterion for mental
illness

331
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,399
because they're all sorts of behavior

332
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,509
the harmful to other people

333
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,870
that we don't necessarily want equality
classify

334
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,250
as forms of mental illness

335
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,110
all sorts of criminal behavior

336
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,170
is harmful to other people

337
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,380
but it's not necessarily the case

338
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,269
all all criminal behavior

339
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:05,380
is a product of mental illness

340
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,650
in fact we have a special category four
all

341
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,089
met criminal behavior that is the
product of mental illness called the

342
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,260
insanity defense

343
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:20,200
which are succeeds only about one out of
every thousand attends right

344
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,730
solo in society

345
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,770
we're not prepared to ascribe all
criminal behavior to mental illness

346
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,020
but we do sometimes excuse

347
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,440
some criminal behavior

348
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,040
on grounds that the person although it
is mentally ill

349
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,519
so it turns out

350
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:41,330
that in the same way that defining
psychological normality is in fact evi

351
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,700
defining deviance from psychological
normality

352
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,059
isn't so evi either

353
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,260
in the same way

354
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,420
features are normality that i talked
about before

355
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,030
self esteem and self control and
self-awareness and accurate and

356
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,309
efficient ulm

357
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:02,590
or processing the oval although of
reality

358
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,820
they form a kind of conceptual prototype

359
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,429
that psychologically normal people u

360
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:10,490
kind of like that

361
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,979
similarly

362
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:15,049
psychologically deviant people what
kinda like this

363
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:15,760
okay

364
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,250
they tend to deviate from saw
statistical lauren so they don't

365
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,749
necessarily

366
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:21,559
argue that

367
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,529
they tend to deviate from social norms
though not necessarily

368
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:27,670
they tend to experience

369
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,160
personal distress about the rumors

370
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,990
but not necessarilly

371
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:37,600
and their enormous tends to lead in the
direction of mel adaptive behavior

372
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,419
not necessarily so again that we have
here

373
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:45,909
is just at the level of trying to figure
out what psychopathology means in

374
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:49,520
general there's a kind of family
resemblance

375
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,740
that unites

376
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,170
people have mobile mental functioning

377
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,280
certain set of they tend to have a
certain set of features in common

378
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,700
and there is a family resemblance

379
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,070
that all unites or people

380
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,119
who have some form of mental illness is
well

381
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:10,760
the tender to have problems will likely
as world income

382
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,140
eternal

383
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,190
that we've got to do in these lectures

384
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,700
is to pursue the analogy

385
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,750
between

386
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,880
mental illness on the one hand
psychopathology

387
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,000
and physical illness on the other hand

388
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,130
in the same way that medical illness

389
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,340
involved

390
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,860
deviations frelimo

391
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,120
physical

392
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,360
metaphysical structure and function we
can say that

393
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,640
mental illness or psychopathology

394
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,560
involves abnormalities in mental
structural or function

395
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,080
abnormalities in cognition

396
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,830
where people have defined abnormal
approval

397
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:51,210
of problems percy dean or remembering or
thinking or communicating

398
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,910
difficulties in demotion

399
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,330
where plot people's emotional responses
to events

400
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:02,110
are somehow problematic or difficulties
in the hall in motivation where their

401
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,260
goals

402
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,200
disorders

403
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,429
motivated behavior

404
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:07,309
somehow or abnormal

405
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:11,669
and in fact when you look at their
various kinds of mental illness

406
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,910
that are described for you and that
chapter envelope and i'm not going to

407
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,960
repeat all those diagnostic categories
of in these lectures

408
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,910
you'll see

409
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,310
that each form of mental illness

410
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,760
there are less satisfactorily

411
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,429
in one or the their all of these broad
categories

412
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,190
so we have certain forms of mental
illness

413
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,440
all where their primary

414
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,210
problem the primary symptom

415
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,570
it has to do

416
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,150
with cognition

417
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,080
in our timers disease

418
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,799
and other forms of dementia for example

419
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,600
there is a problem

420
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,620
basically a problem of memory okay
that's why i alzheimer's our patients

421
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,760
are treated

422
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,680
often treated in so so-called memory on
disorders clinics

423
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,779
but as you'll see in a couple of minutes

424
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,830
there's another form with major mental
illness

425
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:05,500
schizophrenia where there are two
different problems in cognitive function

426
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,880
all schizophrenics that would have
altered to a particular difficulties

427
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,789
with memory

428
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:13,780
but they do have a lot of difficulties
with attention

429
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,980
and they have a lot of difficulty

430
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,630
maintaining

431
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:22,840
or normal trains of thought to have
difficulty or thinking are clearly

432
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,830
there is

433
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,450
there is a class all involve dot mental
illness is known as the anxiety

434
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,290
disorders

435
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,309
well the problem with the primary
problem

436
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:34,549
is not one of cognition

437
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:37,490
but rather is one of emotion

438
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,240
in the anxiety disorders

439
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,910
people feel abnormally high levels ald

440
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,880
negative emotional states like fear

441
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,720
alarmed

442
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,510
and then in various affective disorders
like mania and depression

443
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:52,970
again

444
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:58,279
the abnormality is a motion elin nature
not primarily cognitive nature

445
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,320
depressed people

446
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,279
feel sadder there mate

447
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,520
or two

448
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,220
all

449
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,410
people with mania

450
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,490
feel happier

451
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,999
well i suppose or that they want to

452
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:13,680
and and and and the motivational our
domain we have a uh... you know

453
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,940
a form of mental illness known as
psychotic with me

454
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,120
otherwise known as antisocial
personality disorder

455
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,320
the end of the these individuals

456
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,300
seem

457
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,870
all in the able to

458
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,269
conform their behavior

459
00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:33,370
to the demand solved the although of the
wider social the barman

460
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:33,730
basically

461
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,620
they just don't care or appear it
appears

462
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,830
but they don't care

463
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,519
to conform their behavior

464
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:45,330
to of the prevailing social demands but
in the each instance of psychopathology

465
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,640
we have someone abnormality in mental
structure or function

466
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,620
on thirteen

467
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,230
the person's ability to engage in

468
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,140
normal cognition

469
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,790
emotion or motivation

470
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,080
which results

471
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,789
in some kind of abnormal

472
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:04,460
or mel adoptive of behavior

473
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,470
so again

474
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,780
very definition of psychopathology

475
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,240
is based on an analogy

476
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,890
between mental illness

477
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,230
and physical illness

478
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,960
in the same way that medical pathologies

479
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,640
refer to abnormalities in

480
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,960
physical structure or function

481
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,409
psychopathology refers to

482
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:26,780
abnormalities

483
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,169
mental or psychological structure

484
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:30,460
or function

485
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,059
we can continue to pursue

486
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:38,080
this analogy between mental illness on
the one hand and physical illness on the

487
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,479
other hand are by looking at that is
known in although psychology

488
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:47,610
as the medical model all psychopathology

489
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,080
and the idea behind the medical model

490
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,730
its employees

491
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:57,040
is the preferred is simply to pursue
this analogy between medical illness and

492
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,850
mental illness

493
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,190
all the way on down

494
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,429
so for example

495
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:05,470
but the real language that we used to
talk about mental illness

496
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,030
is language that is derived from
medicine

497
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,320
we have mental patients

498
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,409
who are treated

499
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,340
in mental hospitals

500
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,740
we have programs

501
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,650
of mental hygiene

502
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,250
better intended to prevent of mental
illness of from occurring

503
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,220
we diagnose on mental illness

504
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,030
we treat of when we tend to try to
achieve a cure

505
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,800
or if we can't all or they'd if we can't
killed a mental illness

506
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,589
then we tried to put the person in some
kind of rehabilitation program

507
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:42,350
it's exactly analogous to the way we
treat

508
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,289
medical illnesses of various are the
kinds

509
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:46,980
if you saw for any yaar

510
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,730
a lot of that there's some kind of uh...
a spinal cord injury

511
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,250
first thing we do is diagnose it

512
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,570
then we try to treated if we can try to
fix it

513
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,440
if we can't

514
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,490
would give you a rehabilitation regime

515
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,590
to allow you to learn how to live with
that it's exactly the same way

516
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,419
we treat

517
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,190
of mental illness

518
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,770
then that the medical matter of illness

519
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,159
we think about

520
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,100
all symptoms

521
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,830
as being closed by some kind of
underline or the pathology

522
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,930
but symptoms refer to

523
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,900
public manifestations

524
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,780
of some kind of of illness

525
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,449
when you have a fever

526
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:30,369
you take your temperature if it's above
ninety eight point six

527
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:31,740
that's the symptom

528
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,520
ald

529
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,400
some kind of underline of pathology

530
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,539
if you've got obtain in your

531
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,960
or you've got swelling in your legs

532
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,159
it's the symptom of some kind

533
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:45,090
of underlying pathology

534
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,310
and in the same way

535
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:50,900
the symptoms of mental illness whatever
they are the abnormal fears or the

536
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,640
difficulties in communicating or the
delusions of a host of asians or

537
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,070
whatever

538
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,020
but to be

539
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,530
on uh... caused by some kind of a
hundred flying pathology

540
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:06,830
and the idea of diagnosis is the figure
out what that underlying pathology or is

541
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,220
so their heart

542
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,450
individual symptoms of mental illness

543
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,309
tend to cluster together

544
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:16,910
to format syndromes

545
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,400
syndromes like

546
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,920
schizophrenic though

547
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,770
anxiety disorder

548
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,470
childhood autism

549
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,590
mental retardation

550
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,210
manic-depressive illness bipolar
disorder or whatever

551
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,590
brought this up with the irs

552
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,990
mental illnesses

553
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,419
although identified in terms of salams
set of symptoms

554
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:39,010
which tend to go together

555
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,410
and then finally and the language of
medical pathology

556
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,429
we have diseases

557
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:47,730
which are syndromes that have some kind
of known cause

558
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,770
okay

559
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,070
on

560
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,100
for example

561
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,539
or if you have leukemia we know what the
causes of leukemia or the symptom of

562
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:57,230
leukemia is an abnormal

563
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,390
white cell count

564
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,039
or bought

565
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:02,059
you underline collins

566
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:05,120
or is for the it is

567
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,640
something

568
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,380
gone wrong in the blood stream

569
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,599
are and that is the difference between

570
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,260
ascend rome which is just a cluster of
symptoms worried about the cause is

571
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,399
and the disease

572
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,700
which is a syndrome

573
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,830
with anyhow

574
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,420
with unknown cause

575
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,779
okay so we can

576
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:24,580
this is what the medical model
psychopathology really looks like a nine

577
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,760
stressing this because you will often
read

578
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,010
and one of the places that you will
sometimes read this is in your textbook

579
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:37,690
are somewhat yet accurate portrayal of
what the medical model all is all about

580
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,719
also before

581
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:41,200
but the medical model of psychopathology

582
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,210
is that the assumes that there's an
organic or physical cause

583
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,070
of mental illness

584
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,860
turns out that is not what the medical
model or is our is all about

585
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,529
commitment

586
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:55,150
argued gotten better

587
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,370
fall but he's still

588
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,850
doesn't quite have the medical model
right after work it out and for twenty

589
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,820
five years

590
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,630
uh... and uh... still

591
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,930
resisting my influence here

592
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,090
or partner

593
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,440
andries old friends one of my teachers

594
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,380
are part of the apartment refers to was
the pathology model as what i mean by

595
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,029
the medical model the only difference is
i'm right when i refer to it as the

596
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:21,650
medical model

597
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,270
or and uh... and he's not

598
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,929
our medical model for psychopathology
says

599
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:32,350
is that psychopathology has a natural
cause

600
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,929
our cars that can be understood

601
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:39,310
by the application all of the scientific
on the method

602
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:42,110
that's ever medical bottle assumes

603
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:45,790
medical model was first and foremost an
analogy

604
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,410
between mental illness and physical
illness

605
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,549
but as far as close as coal

606
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:52,119
all the medical model

607
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:52,539
says

608
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:54,200
is that mental illness

609
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,889
has a natural cause

610
00:28:55,889 --> 00:29:01,750
that can be discovered by science
natural cause as opposed to watch

611
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,980
two hundred three hundred years ago

612
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:09,210
we padegi super natural mobile of mental
illness

613
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,360
that basically said that

614
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,080
mental illnesses foreclosed by

615
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,330
demon possession

616
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,279
that the day i had gotten a lot of the
person

617
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:23,149
art and art i i was making the person do
it and engage in these kinds of things

618
00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:27,590
and the proper treatment for what we now
recognized as mental illness

619
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,380
all is essentially xlr schism

620
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,440
of the of the devil

621
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,070
dartmouth the bottle of mental illness
that prevailed

622
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,460
as recently as the evolved

623
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,140
as the fifteen th and sixteen th on

624
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,880
fifteen to sixteen centuries

625
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,770
well recently however

626
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,740
burger is another alternative to the
medical model

627
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,240
known as buffalo model of mental illness

628
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,290
which basically says

629
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:59,330
the kinds of symptoms that are part and
parcel of mental illness

630
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,690
dana bradley

631
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,290
displayed

632
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,240
by the person

633
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,710
there is arms all their it's both full
behavior

634
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,850
so when somebody's walking down the
street and quacking like doc or dot

635
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,580
speaking and some kind of uh... oh

636
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,739
or this weekend some kind of weird
language

637
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:18,190
the ideas they could be

638
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,080
normal if they just ride

639
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,930
to be normal or if they wanted

640
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,930
to be normal

641
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,460
all in the same way

642
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,460
that if you think the class of mental
illness is demon possession

643
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,630
but proper treatment of mental illness
is acts or schism

644
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,760
if you think

645
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,080
that mental illness

646
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,799
is deliberately willful behavior

647
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:43,930
that proper treatment of mental illness
or the mental illness

648
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,060
punishment

649
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,480
it in the eighteen th and eighteenth
centuries

650
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,019
that's exactly how the mentally ill were
treated

651
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:54,669
they were punished they work within two
silence which were essentially prisons

652
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,530
for the mentally ill

653
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:00,169
of there are triggered it would look in
the nineteenth century literature

654
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:03,520
and find prescriptions for our caller
equality

655
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,510
dumping people in whoever many people
dot waterboarding exactly but pretty

656
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,429
close

657
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:10,660
arctic at the death of the dead out of
it

658
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,509
all

659
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:16,320
all of the brutal treatments of the
mentally ill and templeton all intending

660
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,170
onto

661
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:21,930
basically punishment for be mentally ill
but we don't do that under the medical

662
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:22,659
model

663
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:25,879
will be saying in the of medical model

664
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:28,310
is that people cared help

665
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,980
the mentally ill

666
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,859
anymore than they could help

667
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:34,669
had been cancer or heart disease

668
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:35,799
and people

669
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,499
don't was

670
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:37,530
killed themselves

671
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,370
to be audible of the mental illnesses in
the product out

672
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,440
spirit possession or demon possession

673
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,199
anymore

674
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:45,250
than cancer

675
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,070
or heart disease is a product of spirit
possession

676
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,500
all

677
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,240
weird even session

678
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,960
so here is conduct henry think about
mental illness

679
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,220
in very or in very broad our terms

680
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,750
when it comes to not the

681
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,669
natural classes of mental illness or

682
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:10,140
again we can think about two different
kinds of causes

683
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,630
there are some at a genetic theories of
mental illness

684
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,380
and there are cycle genic theories of
mental illness

685
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,470
in this summer genic theories of mental
illness sino comes from the greek word

686
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,260
for a body

687
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:29,360
mental illnesses related to solve the
problem in barely functioning

688
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,290
okay

689
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:34,170
is coming up problem of anatomical
structure

690
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,639
we now know

691
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:39,529
that the calm symptoms of al timers
disease

692
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:41,760
all related to

693
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,080
data anatomical into irregularities
plaques and tangles in neural tissue in

694
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,600
the brains of people

695
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,990
with al timers or disease

696
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,820
but sometimes the anatomy is intact

697
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,980
it's operations are

698
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,310
not quite correct

699
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,590
you had a good have all the

700
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,759
on the same way that you could have
detected anatomical sd

701
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,060
leading the mental illness you can also
have defects

702
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,009
in physiological function

703
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:10,350
leading to mental illness

704
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,389
for example asg latenan talks about in
his are

705
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:15,630
it is chapter

706
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,389
there are all grown

707
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:20,109
there is any other prominent curious cuz
a friend here

708
00:33:20,109 --> 00:33:23,979
that related to the death of the
deficits in a particular

709
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:26,510
neurotransmitter known as dopamine

710
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:30,580
and there is a prominent theory of
depression that relates to

711
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,950
to abnormal all levels of a particular

712
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,120
moreau transfer

713
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,640
known as serotonin

714
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,830
here we have

715
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,230
defects in physiological function

716
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:43,550
operating in a about amie it's
essentially normal

717
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,299
is and i'll timers disease

718
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,860
you have what appears to be

719
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,740
abnormalities in anatomical structure

720
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,470
sometimes the origins of mental illness
are indeed some atlantic

721
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,769
the are mental illness has its origins
in

722
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:01,630
some kind of abnormal

723
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,649
bottling function

724
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:04,410
but it's not always the case

725
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:08,460
we also have certain forms of or mental
illness

726
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,250
they are in underwriting closed inside
patriotic

727
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,380
there's nothing particularly wrong with
the bodies of the individuals there's

728
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,839
nothing particularly wrong

729
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,769
with all of the with their own anatomy
or physiology

730
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,979
but that there has been some kind of
experience

731
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,439
or some kind of

732
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:31,950
all learning that has produced the o
deal uh...

733
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,720
the problem

734
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,510
i think probably the clearest example
although i a l a a psychedelic

735
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,970
of or cause of mental illness

736
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,539
isn't post-traumatic stress disorder

737
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:43,159
ability

738
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,800
of widely

739
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,740
all recognized form of mental illness to
carried your about it on the news all

740
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,799
the time

741
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:52,349
on with veterans coming back from all

742
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:56,160
from old iraq suffering from pete e_s_t_
or

743
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,949
vietnam veterans saw that although those
suffering from p_p_o_'s d

744
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:03,619
because that is psychological

745
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:06,050
these individuals have been exposed to

746
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,499
traumatic experiences of various kinds

747
00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:11,319
that lead to the development

748
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,219
although form of mental illness

749
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:15,430
known as post-traumatic stress disorder

750
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,189
that along with their anatomy

751
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:21,379
nothing wrong with their physiology but
was part of but there's been some

752
00:35:21,379 --> 00:35:26,189
psychological experience that has led to
the alone

753
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:29,839
or the to the old formation of these
terrorist kinds of symptoms

754
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,020
and but sometimes

755
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,359
it's not so much

756
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:37,569
the direct experience of travel have
been traumatized by some art of those

757
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:38,400
fumbled

758
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,700
massive uh... psychologically damaging
of that

759
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,249
but dont think there is some forms of
mental illness

760
00:35:44,249 --> 00:35:47,880
that seemed to will be acquired by the
individual

761
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,289
ald

762
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:50,539
through a history of social learning

763
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:53,659
three clear example i think is and
what's known as the

764
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:57,120
learned helplessness model of depression
where

765
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,609
marty seligman

766
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:01,890
lynn abramson lora lohr eight and i and
others

767
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:02,770
have argued

768
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:08,140
that some people become depressed
because they have learned to think about

769
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,420
themselves and their world in a
particular way to have

770
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,109
on abnormal the death

771
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:18,079
who negative expectations for themselves

772
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,599
all for the future

773
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,720
on and so on

774
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,490
all of his again nothing wrong with the
brains of these individuals

775
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:29,380
their dopamine system there serotonin
system is working pretty much a fine

776
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,609
but the problem leading to the
depression

777
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:33,979
is that they have learned to think

778
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:37,599
about themselves and the world in a
particular way

779
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,809
so dead

780
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:41,650
these some energetic causes of mental
illness

781
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,059
can be discovered by science

782
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:47,210
okay but can the secretary dick

783
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,319
causes of mental illness

784
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:49,859
again

785
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:52,670
it's the idea that there are natural
causes

786
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,600
that can be discovered by science

787
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,770
is at the root

788
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,290
of the medical model

789
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,529
volvo of mental illness

790
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:02,660
so now let's get a little less abstract
for a second

791
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:07,690
and let's think about exactly what kinds
of mental illnesses although there are

792
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,039
again not going to go uh... this song

793
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:13,150
because glavin does such a good job

794
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,999
of of it

795
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,869
just to say that there are cool lots of
different forms of mental illness can

796
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,129
take

797
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:24,130
sometimes some forms of mental illness
or donors organic brain syndrome

798
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,890
because they seem to be closed by

799
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,940
damage to one or another

800
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,559
of the brain structure

801
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:35,180
there are certain developmental
disorders like a mental retardation

802
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,459
or childhood autism

803
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:38,559
that he emerged

804
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:45,230
all over the orlando or you're really of
bases of of of psychological development

805
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:48,739
or a parent in infancy your tolerable id

806
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:50,069
or childhood

807
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:51,530
then there are other

808
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,049
forms of mental illness that become
apparent in adulthood

809
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:58,969
there are so called psychosis like
schizophrenia were the affect of

810
00:37:58,969 --> 00:37:59,699
disorders

811
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:04,219
so called the roses like the anxiety
disorders and up and phobias

812
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:07,140
there is some psycho physiological
disorders

813
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,990
like some forms of all sorts

814
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,719
where the physical

815
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:11,529
disease

816
00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:15,200
has a psychological clause like lots of
stress

817
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,630
and anxiety

818
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,260
their dissociate disorders what used to
be called hysteria

819
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,209
like multiple personality disorder to
some sort of identity are disorder

820
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:25,559
on

821

uh... psychotherapists or psychiatrists
clinical psychologist psychiatric social

836
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,329
workers

837
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:09,290

so we've got these various forms of
mental illness and again

845
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:29,210

00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:32,329
or like i don't want to repeat that
material here

847
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:36,689
what i do want to do army and the time
this remaining twisted up however is to

848
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:37,849
talk about

849
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:42,010
highly classified the various forms of
mental illness

850
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,529
when you plan to

851
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:48,959
clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist
or a psychiatric social worker and say

852
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:52,959
i'm feeling more of a lot done really
feeling depressed or i'm really feeling

853
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:53,489
anxious

854
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:54,869
i can you help me

855
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:57,169
there first thing

856
00:39:57,169 --> 00:39:59,969
following the medical model the first
thing you want to do

857
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:05,130
is to diagnose the owners to try to
figure out what it is all of that that

858
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,680
that's wrong with the person

859
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,920
and again

860
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,280
are watching to see the connection

861
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,430
between

862
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:16,299
medical and psychiatric diagnosis on the
one hand

863
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:19,619
classification on the other hand because
what happens is

864
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:22,209
when you make on medical diagnosis

865
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:24,750
you classify a patient

866
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,219
into a category

867
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:29,750
of people who have on kind or arab

868
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,569
disease or illness in common

869
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:33,840
the symptoms

870
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:39,410
one of the person has hallucinations or
on depression or anxiety or whatever

871
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,549
a convict those as features

872
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:44,190
and at the same homes

873
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,609
which are

874
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:49,370
std defined by clusters off-color
currying

875
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,830
although the symptoms

876
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,160
can be thought all of those categories
so schizophrenic

877
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,779
is a category of mental illness

878
00:40:56,779 --> 00:41:01,439
all individuals with schizophrenia have
certain kinds of features all you know

879
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:02,350
in common

880
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:05,669
and then you want to diagnose mental
illness in a patient

881
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:09,279
you to the same thing that you do if you
are a medical doctor

882
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:11,109
diagnosing a physical illness

883
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:12,299
what you try to do

884
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:13,570
is to match

885
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:19,770
the patients' symptoms to the symptoms
better characteristic of various kinds

886
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,170
of illnesses

887
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,949
and then say

888
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:23,929
first thing we know is

889
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:26,170
you have bipolar disorder

890
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,680
or you have the symptoms of
post-traumatic stress disorder or you

891
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,040
have

892
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,489
the symptoms of schizophrenia or
whatever it is that you've got

893
00:41:35,489 --> 00:41:39,979
diagnosis is essentially an active
categorization the american psychiatric

894
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:41,380
association

895
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:45,030
has published in its diagnostic and
statistical manual

896
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,259
and official west

897
00:41:47,259 --> 00:41:53,009
all the various forms of mental illness
there are and what bearer

898
00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:53,390
characteristic

899
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,749
all symptoms are

900
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:58,469
so that when you're confronted with a
new patient

901
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:00,400
determined what his or her symptoms are

902
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,680
and then basically

903
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,550
figure out well

904
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:06,940
where the our where the individual
should be ought to be appropriately all

905
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,420
the classified

906
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,640
that's an interesting

907
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,970
is follow this idea

908
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:18,190
that psychiatric psychiatric diagnosis
is essentially an active classification

909
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,079
and then try to figure out

910
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:26,559
exactly what kind of all categories the
psychiatric diagnoses

911
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:29,659
even

912
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:30,549
history

913
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:35,649
off the coyote re but they are in a
psychiatric diagnoses various forms of

914
00:42:35,649 --> 00:42:36,749
mental illness

915
00:42:36,749 --> 00:42:41,499
were considered to be proper steps just
like the proper sets that we talked

916
00:42:41,499 --> 00:42:45,069
about in our lecture on categorization

917
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:46,670
so for example

918
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,759
alm

919
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:50,530
nineteenth of early twentieth century
psychiatrist

920
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,539
distinguish between psychotic season
overseas

921
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:55,000
in psychosis

922
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,400
all that there is a alm

923
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,870
departure from reality testing the
person just doesn't see reality are

924
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,809
correctly

925
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:04,110
in the new roasters

926
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:07,489
there's usually some kind of underlying
anxiety

927
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:09,920
if you have difficulty in reality
testing

928
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,219
you be labeled

929
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:16,030
with psychosis if you add problems of
anxiety you be able able too

930
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,099
out with directions

931
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,109
reality testing

932
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:22,119
and anxiety we're defining features

933
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:23,639
or the categories

934
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:24,619
morose is

935
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:28,920
and also i got the psychosis and
neurosis uh... respectively

936
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,869
and then

937
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:33,220
once you determine that the person had a
psychotic disorder

938
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,620
then you could make a more fine-grained
classification

939
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,650
in terms of whether the person had say's
is a friend here

940
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,900
or manic depressive illness if the
person's all god departure from reality

941
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,439
testing was in the cognitive domain

942
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:51,079
the psychiatrist would lean toward a
diagnosis of schizophrenia

943
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:52,380
if the person's

944
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,919
depart all problems with reality testing
were in the emotional domain

945
00:43:56,919 --> 00:44:00,869
you wouldn't know make a diagnosis of
manic-depressive illness

946
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:01,630
similarly

947
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,139
if a person

948
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:05,869
had some specific advice like

949
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:07,269
being afraid of heights

950
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:11,720
or being afraid of spiders are being
afraid of even the presence of other

951
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,380
people

952
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,099
you would diagnose the person is having
a phobia

953
00:44:15,099 --> 00:44:17,469
but if the person was just worried

954
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:18,959
about everything

955
00:44:18,959 --> 00:44:22,039
all the time

956
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:23,710
you'd make a diagnosis

957
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,019
solve all of anxiety disorder

958
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:26,599
all

959
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:28,459
to be more concrete

of which doesn't mean what

976
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:14,080
autism means today

977
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,739

00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:46,059
single a necessary an jointly sufficient
to define the category of schizophrenia

988
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:46,780
and all

989
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:51,770
further barriers forms of mental illness
we're diagnosed in precisely all of this

990
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:56,119
white so you had a super category of
psychosis

991
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:01,959
a basic level category alts cuz a friend
hill or manic depressive illness and

992
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,819
then underneath alm

993
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:06,480
alot of schizophrenia

994
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,950
deborah subtypes

995
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:09,869
and these subtypes were created

996
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:14,859
in exactly the same way as you create
subtypes of a proper set view of things

997
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:17,440
simply by adding new defining features

998
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,359
so importers view simple scads of
schizophrenia consisted just of the

999
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:23,489
phrase

1000
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,569
associated association disturbance

1001
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:27,190
at had only a

1002
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:29,319
ambivalence and autism

1003
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:33,879
hippocratic schizophrenic added a
symptom of childlike behavior

1004
00:46:33,879 --> 00:46:35,399
catatonic

1005
00:46:35,399 --> 00:46:37,209
all bout of schizophrenia

1006
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:41,090
added a symptom multiple movement
disorder essentially

1007
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:46,399
and paranoid schizophrenic added a
defining symptom ought to lucien

1008
00:46:46,399 --> 00:46:48,959
his whiskers are for any other

1009
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:55,549
sale with all the other forms of mental
illness in the early days of psychiatry

1010
00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:57,349
each of these mental illnesses

1011
00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:02,229
was construed as a proper set

1012
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:07,799
her the defining symptoms we're single a
necessary and gently sufficient to

1013
00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:12,219
define the individual is having one
disease or another

1014
00:47:12,219 --> 00:47:14,569
there were sharp and rates

1015
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:16,090
hopewell belgrade's

1016
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:20,260
between adjacent categories if you had
reality testing problems in the

1017
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:25,330
cognitive sphere you were schizophrenic
if u_n_ reality testing problems in the

1018
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:28,040
emotional sphere you had
manic-depressive illness

1019
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,090
if you had reality testing problems you
were psychotic

1020
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,950
if you had exactly disorder

1021
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:33,859
you were dorado

1022
00:47:33,859 --> 00:47:36,079
they were sharp boundaries

1023
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,169
between budgets and categories

1024
00:47:39,169 --> 00:47:42,649
it was a hierarchical vertical structure

1025
00:47:42,649 --> 00:47:44,009
all

1026
00:47:44,009 --> 00:47:44,429
created

1027
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:50,029
by eddie and subtracting part of the
defining or the defining symptoms

1028
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:51,039
okay so you have

1029
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,359
a hierarchy don't look like this

1030
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:57,479
mental illness divided into psychosis
and the row sees

1031
00:47:57,479 --> 00:48:00,209
psychosis divided into the matter to
press of illness

1032
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:01,579
and schizophrenia

1033
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:04,109
and schizophrenia deflated into

1034
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:10,699
it's four sub categories yet sad they
really need system

1035
00:48:10,699 --> 00:48:12,329
just like

1036
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:15,419
proper sets are a very neat system for
classifying

1037
00:48:15,419 --> 00:48:19,049
or other kinds of objects automobiles

1038
00:48:19,049 --> 00:48:20,329
birds

1039
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:21,729
and vegetables

1040
00:48:21,729 --> 00:48:24,650
but it's a system that alternately
failed

1041
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:29,930
for the same reason the proper set
categorization fails in the domains

1042
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:31,969
of fruits and vegetables

1043
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:35,579
an order will be ols and all of

1044
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,109
birds and fish

1045
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:39,359
because it turns out

1046
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,820
well that mental illness

1047
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,739
is unstructured quite this way

1048
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:46,350
or understanding that took a long time

1049
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:48,140
and lead to a revolution

1050
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,629
in how we think about psychiatric
diagnosis

1051
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:55,019
a revolution which i'll talk about on
wednesday

1052
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:56,040
thank you very much

1053
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,890
will see you on wednesday
