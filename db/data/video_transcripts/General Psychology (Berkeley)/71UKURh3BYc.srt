same as always accept

61
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,029
it's twice as long

62
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:58,459
you got three hours to do it that's
plenty of time

63
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:00,349
edits in the first gymnasium

64
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:06,619
uh...

65
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,709

70
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,959
with your g aside very very fast okay

71
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,829
because we've only got

72
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,620
ninety six hours after the exam to get
final grades all in order

73
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,439

74
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,149
monday again at the close of business

75
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:40,679
all make sure when you've accumulated
your five credits that you assign those

76
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,739
credits to psych one otherwise they
don't come to me

77
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,379
i don't have them yet all i don't get
them until sometime in after monday at

78
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,869
five o'clock

79
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:53,719
blog but what i do get them all input
them to the uh... great book on the

80
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:56,629
website and that'll send out an
announcement

81
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:58,079
that the young

82
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,189
that the orchid he credits have been
entered

83
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:01,899
the only issue there is that

84
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:04,859
i can't correct your p_p_ kravitz

85
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:08,359
all the only people who can do that or
the are p_p_ committee i only know what

86
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:09,339
they told me

87
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:12,330
so if there are any issues about our p p
credits

88
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:19,330
you need to be dealing with the or p_p_
committee yes question

89
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,270
that the just relieve your geo site

90
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,449
goes though he or she is keeping a
record of that

91
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,360
that's for a cabal of people who are
under eighteen when the class started

92
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,310
and you're doing the alternative

93
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,969
onto the r p p

94
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:35,340
i'll just turn your information into
your geo side

95
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,549
and he or she will get the information
to me

96
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:42,789
anything else

97
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:47,129
okay last time we were talking about
interventions in sac apa fucking how we

98
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:50,940
treat mental illness once it's been
diagnosed

99
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,280
and up at the close of business last
time i was talking mostly about

100
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,270
various biological treatments

101
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,970
for mental illness

102
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,250
especially the pharmaceutical revolution

103
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,440
in of ordered treatment

104
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,909
that has occurred since the since the
nineteen fifties

105
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:08,330
with a proliferation

106
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,249
of a wide variety of drugs that seem to
be quite effective

107
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:18,009
in at least reducing the symptoms
associated with such major forms of

108
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,280
mental illness

109
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,239
as through the frontier

110
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,800
affect of disorder

111
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,939
and anxiety disorder

112
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:29,219
what i want to turn through today is the
author major

113
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:29,740
treatment

114
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,659
form of treatment for mental illness
which is psychotherapy

115
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:39,229
which doesn't involve direct biological
treatments like driver's door ec t_e_ or

116
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:42,669
or cycles surgery or anything like that

117
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:44,719
do you think about it for a second

118
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:49,139
all forms of psychotherapy are
essentially educational in nature

119
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,800
you've got mental illness people who
have strange thoughts are strange

120
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,360
feelings run wanted desires or whatever
and was like a therapy dog is

121
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,990
essentially

122
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,960
is to provided

123
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,989
and experience through which those
mental status could change

124
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:07,970
through which a person can acquire

125
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,520
new believes no more a bit more our dept
of believes

126
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,030
or feelings for all of our desires

127
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,069
either through some sort of a learning
process

128
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,889
or barrio fourteen the person an
opportunity

129
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,899
to reflect apart those prophecies

130
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,770
and part two

131
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,030
especially important ways of doing this

132
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,129
or others cognizant focal cognitive
therapy

133
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:35,409
which tries to deputation to change his
or her

134
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:36,719
knowledge in police

135
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:38,960
about him or herself in the world

136
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,669
cognitive therapy will also operate on
feelings and desires but it's really

137
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:47,330
directed against knowledge and believes
or behavior art therapy

138
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,289
which tries to change arbitrary try to
change behavior correctly

139
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:53,360
almost talk about

140
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,419
these mostly

141
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:56,249
also

142
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,010
the first point dramatic

143
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,910
is that both pharmacotherapy

144
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,530
and the psychotherapy

145
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:08,469
are intended to change the mental
prophecies in the mental states

146
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,569
of mental patients

147
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:13,460
pharmacotherapy tries to do that

148
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,210
indirectly

149
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,419
the whole purpose of taking psychoactive
medications whether it's

150
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:22,399
oddity psychotic medication prescriptive
friend here

151
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,099
or a uh... assess all arrived for
depression or sutton bed that i had to

152
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:30,710
team for our own before anxiety disorder

153
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,590
is somehow to change the person's mental
state

154
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,400
to get rid of hallucinations to lift the
patient's moving too

155
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,990
complications anxiety or whatever

156
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,119
but it doesn't type changing the
chemical state all of the brain

157
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,630
in psychotherapy all

158
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,160
all the various forms of psychotherapy

159
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,249
tried to change the person's state of
mind directly okay

160
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:56,340
by through various kinds of experiences

161
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,749
there's no chemical mediation that is
there no pills involved

162
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:02,790
noteworthy end of the lecture today

163
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,070
all talk about

164
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,340
are the prospects

165
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,509
for forms of treatment that combine both
pharmacotherapy and all and

166
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:12,330
psychotherapy

167
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,509
there are three major forms of
psychotherapy that are use these kind of

168
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:18,620
these days

169
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,360
sold more than others

170
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,900
classically separate therapy was known
as secretary manic

171
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,659
and insight warranted it was based

172
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:34,440
largely on these theories of sigmund
freud and his followers who argued that

173
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,660
various forms of mental illness

174
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,290
reflected or unconscious

175
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:43,800
conflicts conflicts between various
kinds of forces plano

176
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,340
in the palm of

177
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,970
the plano unconsciously in the person's
mind

178
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,130
and basically the idea was the idea
behind psychoanalysis and other forms of

179
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,630
psychodynamic therapy

180
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,809
is to help the patient as to achieve
some

181
00:08:58,809 --> 00:08:59,570
inside

182
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,560
into the nature of these conflicts

183
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,910
so that he or she can more effectively
evolved over the resolvable

184
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,930
all recently

185
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,120
we've had that we that we've seen the
evolution of a number of so-called

186
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,470
cognitive-behavioral although that's
like a therapies

187
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,669
that are intended to change

188
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:20,689
now look at them for off

189
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:25,730
and now we're grappling behaviors but
they do so through educational

190
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,349
experiences essentially

191
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:31,209
that do not focused too much on things
like

192
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:32,310
unconscious conflict

193
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,710
the childhood are rich in sms of mental
illness and so on

194
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,060
while one big difference

195
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,970
is a photodynamic therapies

196
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,250
tend to focus on that there are and then

197
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,519
of the patient

198
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,470
what happened in his or her childhood or
or or whatever

199
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,350
with that

200
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,100
the cognitive and behavioral therapies

201
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,939
tend to focus on they hear and now

202
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:57,699
when you're feeling now how can we
change that

203
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:01,800
what kinds of behaviors are you engaged
in now how could we change that

204
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,860
without necessarily engaging

205
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,180
in some kind of inquiry into the deep
history

206
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,700
although or these problems

207
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,199
and then finally there

208
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:16,400
there are better than it is a dollop of
the class of so-called humanistic

209
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
all-star apis

210
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,930
which i don't know i don't know whether
there really isn't best classified as

211
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,279
they refuse that all

212
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,940
because the people who go to
psychotherapists for humanistic therapy

213
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:32,010
art mentally ill they don't have
schizophrenia they don't have an

214
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,680
affective disorder they don't have a
full reward obsessive-compulsive

215
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,230
disorder

216
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,520
but what they want to do is the somehow
improve

217
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,670
thereabouts

218
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,300
to lead to better lives but they're not
mentally ill in the usual kind of sense

219
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,740
these humanistic therapy is of the sort
practiced by

220
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,300
abraham buffalo and carl rogers and
others

221
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,259
tend to be very bad directive

222
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:58,230
whereas most active psychotherapy is
intended to

223
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,290
argentina symptoms if not sure

224
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,410
although it does have some kind of
underlying disease

225
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,519
or basically all of these humanistic
therapies

226
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,990
don't have any particular goal in mind

227
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,670
all except perhaps

228
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,309
all go over to nicole of helping the
person

229
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:17,790
offline meany nor actual lies to himself
or whatever

230
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,930
but the really interesting difference

231
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,199
between traditional psychotherapy

232
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,459
whether it's abbe sako

233
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:25,310
dynamic

234
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,470
sort

235
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,099
cognitive-behavioral sort is the change
in the loop in the relationship

236
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:34,420
between the suckers

237
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,790
and that the patient

238
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,220
all

239
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,230
instead of out of their api or a
cognitive all of their api

240
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,930
the person with mental illness

241
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:46,580
really is in the word patient in the
same way you would be if you want your

242
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,870
doctor with the flu war you went to your
doctor with a fever something

243
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,390
if they dr

244
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,360
find out what's wrong with me and tell
me what to do to get rid of it and your

245
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,720
doctor says you've got the flu here's a
pill or you've got an infection here's

246
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,920
an antibiotic or whatever

247
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,040
but in the humanistic auto

248
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,600
all of the other therapies

249
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,130
the uh... though there's really more of
our client

250
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,410
all service provider

251
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,020
relationship

252
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,320
we're the or the person will come to a
humanistic therapists and say i want to

253
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,880
find more meaning in my life i want to
actual ice myself i want to find a peak

254
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,219
experience and it's really a good job of
the psychotherapist

255
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:26,330
toolbar fortifications

256
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:26,899
okay

257
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:30,650
to help the patient get what it is that
he or she wants

258
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:35,540
or put another way in traditional
psychotherapy as in traditional medical

259
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,160
practice the role of the patient is to
do with the doctor travels

260
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,900
him or her to do

261
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,569
in the humanistic therapies

262
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:47,869
the role of the provider used to do with
the client wants also that both the

263
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:50,090
purposes acted more like a loner

264
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,830
or an accountant or

265
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,940
all advertising expected over somebody

266
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,399
on who basically works

267
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,340
uh... at the behest of the uh...

268
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,040
of the client

269
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,310
focused mostly on cognitive behavioral
all forms of psychotherapy

270
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,529
you know of

271
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,170
uh... in in this lecture

272
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,880
because for reasons that you'll see in a
minute

273
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,670
they're the ones that

274
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,050
really work

275
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:19,540
all right here is one area where
cognitive behavioral therapy

276
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,010
homeworks especially well

277
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,230
this is out document of behavior
terribly for anxiety disorders like

278
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,410
phobias or obsessive-compulsive disorder

279
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,050
although the very traditional behavioral
therapy for for business

280
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,970
is what's known as systematic
desensitization

281
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,510
a patient comes in

282
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,829
with an unwarranted excessive fear of
some object

283
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:44,910
maybe it's all of the presence of other
people were of snakes or whatever it is

284
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,090
that the person

285
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,250
has

286
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,340
on extreme fear old and wants to at once
to fix

287
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,779
and what the behavior therapist will do

288
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:55,359
will arrange

289
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,310
for the patient to have

290
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,680
progressively

291
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,880
more

292
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,870
intense exposures

293
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,780
with the feared objects soul patients
got up to make phobia

294
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,860
of first session all the way it might
just be asked to talk about snakes and

295
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,470
be told that there's a snake in the next
roman

296
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,949
the next session

297
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:19,559
of what that goes ok than the sneakers
broad and and put it up for a reimburse

298
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,850
something in the presence of the patient
and then

299
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,769
moved closer and eventually

300
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:27,420
now this makers on the lap of the
patient and uh... of all this kind of

301
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,320
stuff that everybody's fine

302
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,380
what's happening in systematic
desensitization

303
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,810
is the patient is learning not to be
afraid of snakes

304
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,630
because there's nothing to be afraid of
from little snake through though

305
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,360
alone

306
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,760
fault but that's the loneliness periods
okay

307
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,070
that gets rid of the anxiety

308
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:50,000
while there's another version of this
cold implosion therapy or flooding there

309
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,900
is a technical difference between the
two but it doesn't really matter for us

310
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,190
there instead of

311
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,859
all arranging graded exposures

312
00:14:57,859 --> 00:15:00,089
the patient is all put

313
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:05,709
are in direct contact with the fear dot
object of right away

314
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:09,440
this kind of captain there until the
fears subsides

315
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,980
again a very good example of this might
be off veera fights we are in systematic

316
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,949
desensitization

317
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:16,160
you have a person

318
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,780
walk up the outside stairway from

319
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,150
ground floor of the first floor then for
the first for the second floor of

320
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,490
brisburg the second for the third floor

321
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,640
implosion thirty eight am and they are

322
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,180
and they say they're until thereof fear
of heights or whatever it is subsides

323
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,490
now this is not something for amateurs
to do

324
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,230
okay

325
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,699
so if you got up to eighty brothers
something is afraid of heights

326
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:46,540
you do not take em up to the top of the
transamerica tower okay

327
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,560
all of this is something that you've got
a lot need a lot of training to do right

328
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,610
if you do it wrong you'll make the
patient was

329
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,920
that he or she was vindicated buck if
you do it right

330
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,730
it works like a charm these are the
treatment of choice

331
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,060
for these kinds of anxiety disorders
there just terrific

332
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,130
and they all

333
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,850
homework they both work both systematic
desensitization

334
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,250
and implosion therapy or flooding

335
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,490
choir principle that's well known to you
from your from lectures and redeem

336
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:16,959
alerting

337
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,500
they're essentially extension regimes

338
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,589
all of the idea is that

339
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,169
fear is a

340
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:24,359
conditioned response

341
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,550
to all ought to go over some situation
or another

342
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,919
and what you want to do is to arrange
new learning experiences

343
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,949
so as to extinguish that responds

344
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:36,039
and in addition

345
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:40,899
of what the behavior of therapists may
do is to promote the active acquisition

346
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,969
all call more adaptive coping behaviors
so

347
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,399
theater pure extension

348
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,240
on fear response or extinction of the
for your response

349
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,519
or combined with

350
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,310
the learning of some

351
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,360
more adaptive

352
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,790
coping response

353
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,070
his brother example cognitive therapy
for depression

354
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:05,920
i talked last time about two cognitive
theories about the origins of depression

355
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,100
backs our notion of depressive gen x_
camara

356
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,600
that people like water decadent believes
that expectations

357
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,189
about themselves

358
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:16,389
about the world

359
00:17:16,389 --> 00:17:17,650
and the future

360
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,960
and that these depressive genic
cognitive schemata

361
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,080
people depressed

362
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,789
the automation of the of the of sadness
follows from

363
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,890
these various kinds of police

364
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,330
and that has argued

365
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,690
all of the intended inode in addition to
that

366
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,530
are becca's argued that though

367
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,520
uh... depressed patients

368
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,730
our engagement have suffer from certain
kinds of cognitive biases like don't

369
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,840
over generalize things or something

370
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,690
if something goes really badly

371
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,059
bill generalize their negative
expectations to everything uh... ordered

372
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,020
around them

373
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,100
but backed off phone quite so what was
that you could be quite successful

374
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,059
in the treatment of many depressed
patients

375
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,220
by simply

376
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,250
persuading them to think otherwise its
location comes as i am are rotten person

377
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,220
dot world is terrible and dot whenever
everyone is going to helena handbasket

378
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,020
and although the purposeful sec

379
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,150
or you're really a rotten person

380
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,660
from anybody like you didn't have
succeeded or repair or whatever

381
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,530
persuading the person that things aren't
as bad as he or she believes them to be

382
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,919
in some cases

383
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,799
that was actually on range for the
person to have therapeutic success

384
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:28,440
experiences

385
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,929
so that the person who actually have an
experience of success

386
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:35,169
and not simply all their have to
reinterpret

387
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:36,570
all past experiences

388
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,890
it's kind of like systematic
desensitization except in reverse

389
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,230
whereas systematic desensitization

390
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,279
about his own educational wishing

391
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,000
that tries to get rid of

392
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,340
some kind of police for emotional
reaction

393
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,170
or cognitive therapy

394
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,550
actively tries to get the person to
acquire

395
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,980
a new set of beliefs about him or
herself

396
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,640
similarly we talked about a person and a
low res idea

397
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,630
that depressive people have a particular
attribution old-style they tend to make

398
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,659
stable

399
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:09,509
internal

400
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:12,990
global attributions for the things that
happen to them

401
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,629
and that went bad things happen to them
are making stable internal global

402
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:18,380
attribution of this week

403
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,660
this bad things happen because i'm an
awful person i've always been awful i

404
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,139
was going to be awful

405
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:25,580
and therefore not everything

406
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,890
that's going to make a depressed so or
what they propose is that what approach

407
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,720
cognitive approach to depression

408
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,330
is to of org

409
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,520
basically teach the person

410
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,359
to make more realistic more adaptive

411
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,400
followed causal attributions about the
world

412
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,390
the patients' symptoms

413
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,030
are symptoms auto emotion

414
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,270
sadness

415
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,400
followed by the unwarranted excessive
sadness

416
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,080
but the idea is that these

417
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,700
the sadness

418
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,860
flows form of beliefs about him or
herself

419
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,920
or about the world and what you want to
do is you want to get rid of the sadness

420
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,510
you've got to change the police

421
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:10,690
that's the whole idea behind behind
cognitive uh... behind cognitive therapy

422
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,750
here's another example of carpet
behavioral all

423
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,320
other therapy at work

424
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,950
it looks like a physiological disorders
like the stress related also recycle

425
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,570
octave vote part of the last time

426
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,559
obviously if you've got somebody has got
a medical problem

427
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,350
that's resulting from exposure to stress

428
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,479
but first line of treatment is to get
into the stress or you know

429
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,860
if you've got a guerilla living in the

430
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,019
room next door dealing that perot was
making a nervous

431
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:39,740
vertebral

432
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,050
right feel better instantly

433
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:46,630
dot sometimes you can't get rid of the
stress or

434
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,080
live in a world of stress

435
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,220
someone once called of modern life the
age of anxiety are and so it is you

436
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,039
don't know whether somebody's got out
bomb you or whether somebody is going to

437
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,020
declare war where they're going to get

438
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,860
hit by a beauty buster or whatever it is

439
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,710
but it's going to happen to you

440
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,200
all of so of productive

441
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,410
it in a world where you can't get red

442
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,240
of all the stressors that impinge on you

443
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,090
all but you need is a cognitive
behavioral therapy

444
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:21,220
that will teach you to respond to the
stressors more adapter memoria de

445
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,890
actively

446
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,460
and so called the one very

447
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,820
useful approach to stress reduction

448
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,440
israel taxation training

449
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,360
ally and biofeedback that'll actually
retrain the u_n_ atomic nervous system

450
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,340
so as to maa flight

451
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,940
the persons on orthodontic responses

452
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,979
to stress ors

453
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:43,979
to change the activity of a sympathetic
branch

454
00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:46,130
of the autonomic nervous system

455
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,919
so that it doesn't

456
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,220
farzana said the person into all
paroxysmal missile all uh... panic and

457
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,080
uh... and anxiety

458
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,990
he originally samples

459
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,690
are not so much for major mental
illnesses of any kind

460
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,990
but for the kinds of problems of living

461
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,480
that people will often consult
psychotherapists about

462
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,539
all of those were all there is a dog
very to popular very effective form

463
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,770
all of our social skills training known
as the sort of assertiveness training

464
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,060
which is very useful for two different
kinds the kinds of billy widespread

465
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,620
properties

466
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,760
all the problems

467
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,980
so people just how problems of
assertiveness there are people out there

468
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,960
who dull

469
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,830
who can say no

470
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,930
okay megapixels and while a lot of
trouble

471
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,980
by being unable to the bug bite but not
say no

472
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,740
and the reason

473
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,540
don't say no

474
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,520
quite literally they can't say now that
a lot to do it right

475
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,580
so what happens in the furnace training
to give people practice would say no

476
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,380
so you know nicely

477
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,750
okay

478
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,980
you can maintain relationships with the
people that you sometimes will of will

479
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,400
have to say no to

480
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,020
but that's the real skill

481
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,849
as anybody knows

482
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:00,429
who's ever had a friend asked him to do
something

483
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:03,650
that they are really didn't want to do

484
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,220
very hard to say to somebody now i don't
want to do this yeah

485
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,190
all but

486
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,210
with the sort of mystery you can learn
how to do that and a very effective way

487
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,520
public speaking of anxiety is another
place where assertiveness training is

488
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,730
very

489
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,610
very useful

490
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:21,860
there are a lot of people out there who
are scared to death by the prospect of

491
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,570
speaking in public

492
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,530
alm

493
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,849
and all of the poster mistreating

494
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:29,240
can actually help them by training them

495
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,990
how to do that by giving them practice
and also speaking in public they can

496
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,930
become much much more affective at it

497
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,610
and that's what you're doing if you're
changing the person's skill

498
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:45,000
you're changing a skill that the person
didn't have interpersonal skills that

499
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
they didn't have before

500
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,640
another place where this happens

501
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,330
isn't sex therapy all of whether you're
married or not some people are having

502
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,070
sex

503
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,040
all and all

504
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,030
if you haven't found that out already
you will someday find out that it

505
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,600
doesn't always go as well as you'd like
it to go

506
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
arm

507
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,720
are many individuals have difficulty
maintaining sexual arousal when they

508
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,690
read gauge the sexual behavior

509
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,990
many people have difficulties in
achieving orgasm

510
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,120
and again

511
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,520
not to treat to smart about it this is
the schedule

512
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,540
okay

513
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,980
six is skilled activity there's nothing
natural about human sexual behavior

514
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,529
right it's not like dogs and guerrillas

515
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:33,909
think about when you were told the facts
of life that

516
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:37,040
you will put you know what where

517
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,400
as just crazy

518
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,760
and it doesn't always go

519
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,180
and people who need to learn

520
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,610
how to make law

521
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,010
how to have sex

522
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,370
so that they can

523
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:53,830
get the kinds of pleasure and share the
kind of pleasure that they want to our

524
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,810
with their partner

525
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,120
and sex therapy

526
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,309
does that in the same way well not
exactly the same way that you get my

527
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:00,679
point

528
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,310
in the same way that assertiveness
training

529
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,910
helps people doubt

530
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,680
the more assertive

531
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,109
sex therapy actually teaches people how
to have sex

532
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,700
so that they can

533
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,850
have more pleasure

534
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,330
and give their partners

535
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,200
more of the pleasure that they want to
give them

536
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,650
all of these forms of therapy

537
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,500
whether a systematic desensitization for
forty years

538
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,370
cognitive fault but there are before
depression

539
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,440
social skills training and various of
various sorts

540
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,030
all of which are trying to change the
person's police

541
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,320
change the person skills

542
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,590
change the person's cognitive and
emotional

543
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,870
are competencies

544
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:46,389
they're not looking to analyze your deep
seated relationships with your mother

545
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:49,659
they're not trying to figure out whether
you you're using

546
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:54,149
reaction formation were displacement to
defend against the out of the other pple

547
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:54,710
complex

548
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,600
they're taking people as they are

549
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,390
giving them educational experiences

550
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,440
that'll help to make

551
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,040
the question though question that's hard
over the practice of psychotherapy

552
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,450
almost from the beginning

553
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,820
is a question of whether actually works

554
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,690
we are persuaded by the medical
establishment that drug treatments work

555
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,450
okay because they've done clinical
trials

556
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:24,120
but part of the czars psychotherapists
for a long time we're reluctant to

557
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,049
engage and that kind of research

558
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:28,759
to actually demonstrate

559
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:34,550
that psychotherapy works and there is of
course a problem dependable

560
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,440
social stereotype of light psychotherapy
which suggests that it doesn't work

561
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,250
think about the average woody allen
character is the average woody allen

562
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,450
movie

563
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,050
art that characters billion
psychoanalysis for five days a week for

564
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,690
twenty or thirty years in

565
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,750
never seems to change

566
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,530
never seen this

567
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,039
to get better

568
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,280
and a lot of people of harvard the
suspicion that maybe

569
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,290
that's really

570
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,039
what happens in psychotherapy

571
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,580
people go to a show of money to a
psychotherapist

572
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,360
but they never change

573
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,559
and they never get better

574
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:08,130
how do you think of a british
psychologist

575
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,000
in nineteen fifty two

576
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,690
revealed the extent literature on the
outcome of psychotherapy and came to

577
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,610
precisely that conclusion

578
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,789
he concluded that psychotherapy simply
didn't work

579
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:25,049
okay one-third of patients and
psychotherapy got better but one-third

580
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:29,840
of patients who didn't get psychotherapy
also got better that there was just no

581
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,580
evidence port the effectiveness of all

582
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,470
of bothered of psychotherapy

583
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,870
there is the date here

584
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,169
this nineteen fifty to review

585
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:40,549
card is published

586
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:43,869
just about the time that the
pharmaceutical revolution

587
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:47,299
and all of the day in in in mental
health is beginning

588
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:50,370
all and of course the pharmaceutical
revolution

589
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,720
was a pharmaceutical revolution
precisely because we had

590
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,860
scientific evidence that these drugs
overworked

591
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,539
the evidence that drugs work

592
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:04,929
combined with the available evidence of
psychotherapy doesn't really work

593
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:10,070
also gone mad many people in the medical
in the mental health or establishment

594
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,480
to begin to abandon

595
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,010
psychotherapy

596
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,120
in favor

597
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,270
volvo in favor of uh... drug treatments

598
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,690
hurt the situation is now changed

599
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,279
all

600
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:26,519
psychotherapists have become much more
imbued

601
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,219
much more responsive

602
00:28:28,219 --> 00:28:31,150
to modern social and economic demands

603
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:34,190
for what's known as evidence-based
practice

604
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,740
a movement within the healthcare
generally

605
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,070
to make sure

606
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:44,070
that the procedures that physicians and
all other health of service providers

607
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,970
use

608
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,600
actually work

609
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,530
actually accomplish or therapeutic or
goals

610
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,039
and these are filled with psychotherapy
community

611
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,419
has responded to the demand for
evidence-based practice

612
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:57,559
by collecting

613
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:01,730
new evidence engaging in more research

614
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,880
to show the psychotherapy does work a
lot after all

615
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,679
the general idea

616
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,279
behind evidence-based practice like in a
drug condition is compared to pick a new

617
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,440
drug zoloft

618
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,190
pack still howled or whatever these
drugs are

619
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,750
and belgium to half the patients

620
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,700
and the other half full either not get
any treatment or they'll get a placebo

621
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,090
drivers something like that

622
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:30,940
and then you can determine whether your
new drug actually works by comparing it

623
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,000
to ought to a placebo

624
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,639
you can in principle at least

625
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:37,410
you can do the same thing with
psychotherapy

626
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,419
you can

627
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:39,879
take a group of haitians

628
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:42,930
give half of them some kind of stuff
erica treatment

629
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,280
are for the other half

630
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,670
on you don't read them you compare them
to

631
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,070
two other no treatment control

632
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,639
sometimes there's actually placebos
psychotherapy

633
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:54,700
that you can or that you can do

634
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,130
all or at least

635
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,480
compare anew

636
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,429
all of the form of psychotherapy

637
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:01,330
with traditional practices

638
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,320
okay

639
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,330
and quantitatively

640
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:04,890
check

641
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:09,559
to determine whether psychotherapy works
after all

642
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,129
here is a classic

643
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:14,800
analysis of the effectiveness of
psychotherapy

644
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,200
by glass and his colleagues published in
nineteen eighty at the very beginning

645
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,790
some of the evidence praised of
evidence-based practice movement

646
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,330
in psychotherapy

647
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,900
what i've done a good smith of smith
lessons our colleagues and their

648
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,120
colleagues

649
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,970
of

650
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,140
analyze of number of studies

651
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,870
involving a many different kinds of
treatment

652
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,749
psychedelic treatment like
psychoanalysis

653
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:42,519
distraught therapy which is kind of a
new age therapy that's not used too much

654
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,660
or anymore

655
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,350
all client centered therapy of the sort
proposed by carl rogers

656
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,549
here are some cognitive behavior

657
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:54,210
therapies systematic desensitization
behavior modification

658
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,080
of that type

659
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,530
cognitive-behavioral therapies for
depression

660
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,179
and that we have here this figure

661
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:05,309
all of the better presents the
effectiveness of psychotherapy are

662
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:06,630
basically says that

663
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,210
how many more patients

664
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,330
who got some formal off psychotherapy

665
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,690
got better compared to no treatment
controls

666
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,230
and what you can see here

667
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,830
is that on average about eighty percent
of

668
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,529
patients we'll get some form of
psychotherapy

669
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:28,679
do better than naude unplugged on
treated controls

670
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,210
this was the first

671
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,940
systematic quantitative evidence

672
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,740
the psychotherapy all worked on worked
after all

673
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,590
that the other things that smith glass
and miller pointed out

674
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,049
was that these figures are all pretty
much the same the role in the seventies

675
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:46,630
and dogs and uh...

676
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,190
and the eighties

677
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,740
and i'll get that kind of interesting
what it's like what i also seek a

678
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,900
cognitive behavioral therapy reduced
systematic desensitization therapy

679
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,600
bardera analysis

680
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,480
first view of their analysis

681
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,460
seem to suggest that

682
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,409
psychotherapy worked

683
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:06,139
but that particular form of
psychotherapy you've got didn't really

684
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:07,190
matter

685
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,240
very much

686
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,000
this is what led to what glickman and
other individuals and others as some

687
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,750
people in psychotherapy

688
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,909
refer to as the you know as the day
woodrow bird verdict

689
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:21,940
are gifted everybody here are bred alice
in wonderland

690
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,230
if you didn't there's something you
should do what we are so went over the

691
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,040
break

692
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,480
all at one point dialysis in wonderland
and she all the witnesses

693
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,399
on a bunch of animals go over all

694
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,429
who do work and what they call a caucus
race

695
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:38,299
and basically a caucus race in the
elevator around

696
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:40,590
and then they'll stop

697
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,960
okay that's what the caucus race is done

698
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,880
and alice asks the dodo bird who was one

699
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,379
uh... because she was so who's going to
get the prize

700
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:52,060
and the dodo bird response replaced or
everyone

701
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,919
as one

702
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,210
and so everyone must have

703
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,779
of the prize

704
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:00,049
there is a tendency and the
psychotherapy community

705
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:06,480
to opt to wonder if you get burt verdict
about the effects of psychotherapy

706
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,050
secretary of the works

707
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:12,150
okay but it doesn't matter what kind is
still available but kinda psychotherapy

708
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:12,980
debt

709
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,000
all forms of psychotherapy wherein

710
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,910
they all get the prize

711
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,329
of being paid for

712
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:22,670
by insurance or or whatever

713
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,660
it turns out to be not really truth

714
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,649
and you can see

715
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:30,320
but that's not really true

716
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,380
when you look at these percent two other
allot or the probe percentile scores

717
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,760
for work the active cognitive-behavioral
treatments

718
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,830
as opposed to the more so i could never
have agreed humanistic or the treatments

719
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,170
these numbers are bigger

720
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,059
so at least by this standard all

721
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,119
people who get cognitive behavioral
therapy

722
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,480
tend to do better

723
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,400
then people

724
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,570
who are get although that's like a
dominican or humanistic forms of uh...

725
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,919
of psychotherapy

726
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,390
but there's another way to measure the
effectiveness of psychotherapy

727
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,900
it's not just cut

728
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,430
where people stand on some percentile on
the score

729
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:12,800
but rather all of us the physical
comparison of what's known as a fact

730
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,409
someplace where you take

731
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:16,179
the media telkom

732
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,809
of one treatment

733
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,249
the average outcome

734
00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:24,029
and you compare it for the average
outcome of some other treatment

735
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:27,129
are basically the idea here is remember

736
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:30,590
means and standard deviations from the
appendix on statistics

737
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,810
what effect size of one point though

738
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,979
means that the average subject in one
group

739
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:40,129
scored one standard deviation higher
than the average subject in another

740
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:40,560
group

741
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,389
now you don't usually get effect sizes
that largely do sometimes

742
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,770
although colin

743
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,210
gould to develop a statistical measure

744
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:54,249
basically classified effect sizes all in
this way that that sizeof

745
00:34:54,249 --> 00:34:57,409
point to all one-fifth of a standard
deviation

746
00:34:57,409 --> 00:34:59,499
called a small affect

747
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:01,840
effect size of half a standard deviation

748
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,579
called a medium affect

749
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:05,019
effect size of

750
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,789
say home

751
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:08,610
forces for the standard deviation

752
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,289
colourful larger effect

753
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:14,579
when you take the smith glass and miller
results

754
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,460
and recast the man forms of

755
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,670
affect fleiss's and not just percentile
scores

756
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,979
if what you see something

757
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:24,479
really quite remarkable

758
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:26,869
all forms of psychotherapy

759
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:27,679
work

760
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,719
him that they are all associated with a
positive effect size

761
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,820
and is a fact sizes are

762
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,969
quite a large by cohen standards

763
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,090
the cognitive

764
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,380
the cognitive-behavioral and the
behavioral

765
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,560
although treatments or associate with

766
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,599
larger effect sizes

767
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,969
work better

768
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:48,170
by an average

769
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,239
for various kinds of bar

770
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,400
on bob things

771
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,749
then do this uh... the humanistic

772
00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:55,420
or the second amendment

773
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:55,900
wildflowers

774
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,789
so it's not true

775
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,289
that we'll have one

776
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:01,429
and almost tab prices

777
00:36:01,429 --> 00:36:03,879
what is true with at all

778
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:04,970
finish the race

779
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,880
and everybody's going to get you know a
purchase of haitian metal

780
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,799
cognitive-behavioral therapies are
better

781
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:14,540
on average cognitive-behavioral
therapies

782
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:20,269
all deserves all status as the ya as the
standard of care

783
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:21,340
here's another

784
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,399
uh... recent comparison by whites and
whites

785
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:29,509
on we are looking at uh... effectiveness
not an adult and children adolescents

786
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:33,969
buff treatments received by these
thought individuals are classified as

787
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:37,840
non behavioral either or psychodynamic
or humanistic

788
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,440
or behavioral including cognitive
treatments

789
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,659
and you can see that the behavioral
treatments for children and adolescents

790
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:45,669
roughly twice

791
00:36:45,669 --> 00:36:48,799
the effects on its as are for the

792
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:51,499
as for the non behavioral on treatments

793
00:36:51,499 --> 00:36:55,679
so all psychotherapy is really are
created equal

794
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,109
sam forms of psychotherapy are better
than others

795
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:00,420
on average

796
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,769
cognitive-behavioral forms

797
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:04,970
the focus on the hill now

798
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,570
and our actively

799
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,229
devoted to

800
00:37:08,229 --> 00:37:08,869
change

801
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:10,819
an agenda of change

802
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:11,950
tend to work better

803
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,940
than psychedelic therapies that focus on
the

804
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,030
there and then

805
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,290
or humanistic

806
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,400
therapies that say

807
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,449
gee i don't know what you want to do
today

808
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:22,160
of

809
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,760
in the first place

810
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,029
also sounds like a therapies are good
for specific problems

811
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:32,610
systematic desensitization implosion
therapy

812
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,169
flooding

813
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:35,390
they are the treatment of choice

814
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,670
four various anxiety disorders

815
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,619
for phobias

816
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:40,919
an obsessive compulsive disorders

817
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:43,130
the cognitive-behavioral therapies

818
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,639
are ort eve ficient

819
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,259
on average

820
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:50,119
the us like a dynamic or humanistic
therapies

821
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:54,329
which is to say that they get their
results more quickly

822
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:56,610
and therefore more cheaply

823
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,079
on sixty or treatment sessions usually

824
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:04,869
to get a successful outcome with
cognitive behavioral therapy compared to

825
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:08,959
other forms of therapy so i know

826
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:11,140
advocacy grounds does it work

827
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,169
how well does that work

828
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:17,329
on specificity grounds you are there
specific treatments for specific

829
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,589
disorders

830
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:20,999
on efficiency grounds

831
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:26,809
how much bang for the box do you get
what's the clotbuster cost-benefit ratio

832
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:29,089
bacardi behavioral therapies

833
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:31,299
tend to be uh... the yard

834
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:33,369
though you know that they're a piece of
choice

835
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:35,819
and they tend to be

836
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:37,029
they tended to serve

837
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:40,500
oh uh... status as the standard of care

838
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,809
for for psychotherapy

839
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:49,170
then the recent trend one new trend in
all of the treatment of mental illness

840
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,009
has been to combine

841
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:52,660
psychotherapy

842
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,390
with pharmacotherapy to see all uploaded
to see what happens there

843
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,429
here's a relatively recent study by
teller

844
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:04,199
and associates patients with major
depressive disorder

845
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:04,809
all

846
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:08,940
oh who got cognitive behavioral therapy
basically

847
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,819
back type cognitive behavioral therapy

848
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:12,990
all or

849
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,500
or a new

850
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,539
you s_s_ alright drug like axial

851
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:18,910
and these patients

852
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:25,309
we're randomly assigned to either to get
psychotherapy alone no drugs

853
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:26,839
drabs alone

854
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:28,559
no psychotherapy

855
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,810
now or a combination

856
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,679
of drugs and psychotherapy

857
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:38,459
here or the results of treatment after
all a after twelve months

858
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,539
what you can say

859
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:41,850
drugs here are

860
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:45,089
patients or actually in remission no
symptoms

861
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:48,630
in the green patients huang have fault

862
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,789
all responded positively but they still
got some symptoms

863
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:55,040
you can see that the other columns of
drug alone

864
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,839
and drug plus psychotherapy

865
00:39:56,839 --> 00:39:59,009
they're pretty much equivalent

866
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:02,859
psychotherapy as as good as the trial

867
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:09,009
the combination of drug and the
psychotherapy basically almost doubles

868
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:10,459
all of the success rate

869
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:12,890
all you get much more our success

870
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,079
and especially

871
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,099
much more on many more patients going
into

872
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:20,130
are going to complete remission
combination

873
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,309
of drugs and therapy seems to work
better

874
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:26,799
then either drugs or therapy alone

875
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,239
here is another

876
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:33,309
retesting all but the data from the
keller study we've got here is this is

877
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:36,470
where they started out at the beginning
of therapy you can see that all three

878
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,809
groups pretty much equal

879
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:41,849
well over at the end of twelve weeks you
can see that

880
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:46,689
all three groups responded but the drug
plus psychotherapy group responded

881
00:40:46,689 --> 00:40:47,650
better

882
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,610
and then back here is a yell a one-year
follow-up

883
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,730
and you can see that all these

884
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,659
patients

885
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:57,270
at all three groups up pretty much
maintained

886
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,540
they're all of their treatment success

887
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,680
but here this

888
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,879
very good

889
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:04,360
treatment success for the drug plus
psychotherapy

890
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,640
on combination

891
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,559
has been a specially all of the
especially well maintained

892
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,199
sold this combination

893
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:16,739
you don't have to choose between drugs
and psychotherapy for many conditions

894
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:19,170
the combination seems to be better

895
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,229
there and all all of them now

896
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,939
anyone below one should that be the case

897
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:26,829
well

898
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:27,979
scenes

899
00:41:27,979 --> 00:41:34,900
civil that drugs and psychotherapy
operate i'm different aspects of mental

900
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,559
illness

901
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:41,359
but then the drugs give u says no far
less quick

902
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,449
symptom relief

903
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:46,209
if you've got ends i disorder

904
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:50,520
beautify things a tranquilizers
reordered and he owned by the agents

905
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,150
will reduce your levels of anxiety

906
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:57,729
if you've got depression the s_s_
alright will tend to

907
00:41:57,729 --> 00:42:01,140
all your mode so you're feeling better
pretty quickly

908
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,359
just by virtue of not one of the drug

909
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:06,260
but that's like a thirty dollars

910
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,200
a specially cut active forms of
cognitive behavioral therapy

911
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,000
will teach you ways of coping with your
enormous better tissue better ways of

912
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,720
thinking about the bad things that
happened to you

913
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,589
teach you better ways of coping with the
falls on situations that though

914
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:26,250
that cause the wings lady

915
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:31,329
are better ways of basically adjusting
to your depression

916
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:32,500
the fact is

917
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,589
there when you terminate drug treatment

918
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:40,309
the drugs will wash out of your system
and physiologically you're back where

919
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:41,789
you work

920
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:43,460
but learning the endeavor

921
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,840
over loons

922
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,890
once you've learned something you've
learned it forever

923
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,140
and the other the idea here is

924
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,500
that even if you go off your medication

925
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,760
but still holds

926
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,490
the new bullies the new coping
strategies that you've learned in active

927
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,420
cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy

928
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,450
will last you for a long time

929
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,860
ones reminded all of the old adage

930
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,630
if you give a man a fish

931
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,159
he'll lead for a day but if you teach
'em and how to fish

932
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:12,420
for life

933
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,160
it's the same kind of thing

934
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,859
yet give somebody a drug

935
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:19,500
they'll get pretty immediate symptom
relief as long as they're taking the

936
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,099
drug

937
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:24,539
but if you teach people active coping
strategies

938
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:27,049
active things that they can do about the
rumors

939
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:28,270
that is

940
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,659
something that they can use

941
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:32,529
even when they're not home

942
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:36,419
even when they're not taking the drug

943
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:40,109
so far we've talked about psychotherapy

944
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:45,039
as a treatment for individual patient
with mental illness

945
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,989
give a patient drugs

946
00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:48,759
give a patient's psychotherapy

947
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:53,410
or drugs in psychotherapy in of aligned
in combination

948
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,230
but it's very clear

949
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:58,130
that for many forms of mental illness

950
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,630
active treatment has to reach beyond

951
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:02,960
under the individual patient

952
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,470
and

953
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,409
or extend at least to his or her
immediate family

954
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:12,979
also for example with social skills
training

955
00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:16,619
teacher person in the therapy rule
mohabbat saying that would have people

956
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:17,849
nicely

957
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:21,160
the patient is gonna have to practice
that

958
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:21,890
okay

959
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,390
who do you have to say no to all the
time

960
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:28,009
n_c_r_ family right let me ask you to do
something

961
00:44:28,009 --> 00:44:30,400
so established has to be treated

962
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,150
so that the family well except no for
and answer

963
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:35,839
similarly

964
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,029
in family therapy whether it's

965
00:44:38,029 --> 00:44:39,359
marriage therapy

966
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:44,440
or afdelhi therapy father there for a
for a child with some kind of conduct

967
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,650
disorder or whatever

968
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:48,129
you've got to treat their family

969
00:44:48,129 --> 00:44:50,239
because too often what happens is

970
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,370
that the family accommodates itself to

971
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:56,019
the individual family members' illness

972
00:44:56,019 --> 00:44:59,389
and when the family members stars to
change the whole repeal of the family

973
00:44:59,389 --> 00:45:00,699
gets disrupted

974
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:04,609
so what the problem that's not just at
the individual has to learn to deal with

975
00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:06,100
his or her mental illness

976
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,630
but the entire family

977
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:10,039
and all other people neighbors friends

978
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:11,349
although

979
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:15,859
or whatever have to deal with this is
well and that's what things like

980
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:17,569
structural family therapy will do

981
00:45:17,569 --> 00:45:19,460
it's not just that somebody

982
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,809
comes in for treatment at the bar family
comes in

983
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:26,000
for treatments or whole family is
participating

984
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,589
uh... in their treatment

985
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:29,529
he resolved

986
00:45:29,529 --> 00:45:31,890
an example of this out at work

987
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,180
there is a real

988
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,070
offer for more than thirty people or
adding difficulties are in their

989
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,280
marriages there are basically three
different kinds of therapies part that

990
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,820
we are using first is what's known as
behavioral couples therapy

991
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,320
are which basically focuses on

992
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,220
changing

993
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,200
all

994
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,559
behaviors on one on one purple them
persons behaviors

995
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:57,720
that bothered the other persons
behaviors so if the husband will pick up

996
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,840
his socks in the white hates that

997
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,040
you know behavioral couple therapy

998
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,309
teachers and the pickup in stocks

999
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:06,039
alm

1000
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:11,099
if the are if the art of what woman is
did that with the wife is got some issue

1001
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:15,040
with with the children or whatever and
often doesn't like that

1002
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,540
though that the white to support you
know how to complain about the kids or

1003
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:18,930
whatever

1004
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:22,179
but the focus is on the individuals
problems

1005
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,139
in cognitive-behavioral couple therapy

1006
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:30,540
the focus is not so much and changing
problematic behaviors but i'm changing

1007
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:35,539
ichi individuals interpretations of the
others problematic behaviors

1008
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:38,300
so far has been a while pickup in stocks

1009
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:43,560
all bugaboo be out of the white homes
for their own just that kind of guy he

1010
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,069
does so many other good things will pick
up his stupid socks okay

1011
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:51,819
and everybody kind of gets better and
the people kind of adjust to own jostle

1012
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:52,640
each other

1013
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,319
but the third floor of a couple therapy
or emotionally focused couple therapy

1014
00:46:57,319 --> 00:47:00,539
doesn't focus on the individuals
behaviors

1015
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:05,219
it doesn't focus on the individuals
interpretations of the other individuals

1016
00:47:05,219 --> 00:47:08,640
behaviors rather focuses koppel

1017
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,749
and seeks to strengthen the bomb

1018
00:47:11,749 --> 00:47:14,689
that joins these two individuals

1019
00:47:14,689 --> 00:47:15,920
and it turns out

1020
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,359
that's but one that works best

1021
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:19,789
everything works right

1022
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:22,500
the traditional behavioral couples
therapy

1023
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,609
boser very nice effects license to kill
for those effects license they're very

1024
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:28,309
very nice

1025
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,920
cognitive

1026
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,569
a couples therapy that focuses on
interpretations or problematic behaviors

1027
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:38,150
that works really nicely by new focus on
the bag

1028
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:42,869
when the whole gore treatment is to
strengthen the relationship between the

1029
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:44,509
two individuals

1030
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:46,200
when the koppel is treated

1031
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,619
as a clickable

1032
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:50,149
not just as a pair of individuals

1033
00:47:50,149 --> 00:47:51,449
that's what tends

1034
00:47:51,449 --> 00:47:53,109
too

1035
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:54,429
to work best

1036
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:58,679
so i can or whether you're talking about
along with what they're talking about

1037
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:00,530
major forms of mental illness

1038
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:04,190
we're talking about the risk of into
problems of living or

1039
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:06,559
uh... dot that's dad

1040
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,610
you had to have to move the all of the
individual

1041
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:10,880
and focus

1042
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,900
the uh...

1043
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,180
on the person

1044
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,349
in his or her

1045
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,380
social context

1046
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,470
when you think you are mental illness

1047
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:20,669
try to do it

1048
00:48:20,669 --> 00:48:25,150
when you can't cure a mental illness do
what you can to uh...

1049
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,200
relieves symptoms or two

1050
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,249
help the person to jost

1051
00:48:29,249 --> 00:48:31,589
but there are some other forms of mental
illness

1052
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:32,930
that are joyce

1053
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,829
not curable

1054
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:35,719
brain damage

1055
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:37,159
is forever

1056
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:42,790
so the organic brain syndrome they tend
to be uh... incurable

1057
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:43,939
mental retardation

1058
00:48:43,939 --> 00:48:46,619
uh... that's something that's a chronic
illness

1059
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:51,569
many forms of affect all of all of major
mental illness like schizophrenia and

1060
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:53,899
affect of disorder are also

1061
00:48:53,899 --> 00:48:55,599
or things that

1062
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,499
planet

1063
00:48:56,499 --> 00:49:01,420
very it's a bit always go away even with
very very good treatment combination of

1064
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,240
drugs and psychotherapy or whatever

1065
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,169
what do you do one of those cases

1066
00:49:06,169 --> 00:49:10,149
well in the past we use the warehouses
such individuals in mental hospitals

1067
00:49:10,149 --> 00:49:12,150
which of the wards of which were full

1068
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,069
of chronic mental patients

1069
00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:15,400
but not all of the glove

1070
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,349
full of treatment

1071
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:19,239
active rehabilitation

1072
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:22,749
in the same way that somebody with a
broken leg

1073
00:49:22,749 --> 00:49:24,700
worth spinal cord injury

1074
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,500
or us dot those stroke barbara producing
aphasia

1075
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,880
would get active rehabilitation

1076
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,040
to require skills

1077
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,049
to learn how to cope with a chronic
disease

1078
00:49:36,049 --> 00:49:39,670
in the same way that diabetics are not
just given insulin

1079
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,199
were also given

1080
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:46,379
our own dot thong informational
lifestyle changes and eating habits of

1081
00:49:46,379 --> 00:49:47,549
exercise at all that

1082
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:50,929
the modern treatment of chronic mental
illness

1083
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:55,059
also has to focus on

1084
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:56,249
teaching person

1085
00:49:56,249 --> 00:49:57,609
to occult

1086
00:49:57,609 --> 00:49:59,379
with his chronic illness

1087
00:49:59,379 --> 00:50:00,640
try to get better

1088
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,939
make an optimal social adjustment

1089
00:50:02,939 --> 00:50:04,930
or rehabilitation scheme

1090
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,390
that again

1091
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:09,199
and just focus on the individual

1092
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:11,890
but has to focus on the entire

1093
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:15,709
social matrix in which that individual
lives

1094
00:50:15,709 --> 00:50:17,619
individuals have mental illness

1095
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:20,569
but the successful treatment of mental
illness

1096
00:50:20,569 --> 00:50:23,119
must go beyond the individual

1097
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,320
the social cultural walt

1098
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,109
wold in which that individual has to
live

1099
00:50:30,109 --> 00:50:31,910
thank you very much will finish up on
monday
