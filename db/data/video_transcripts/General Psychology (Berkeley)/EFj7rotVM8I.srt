1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,270
okay we're going to be general lectures
today on the biological basis of mental

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:17,149
life

3
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:21,149
psychology was to find out the very
beginning of the existence of the

4
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:22,829
science by william james

5
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,779
as the science of employees as i
described last time james argue dot the

6
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,760
whole purpose of psychology

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,040
is to try to understand the cognitive
emotional and motivational process these

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,980
that underlie human experience

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,680
thought and action

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,400
but because the brain is the physical
basis of the morning

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,250
the bribe the mind is what the brain
does

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,050
james began his

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,600
offense treatise on psychology with a
discussion of brain function

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,230
setting a precedent and followed almost
universally in introductory courses for

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,050
the next more than a century of begin in
the course

16
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,529
with some discussion wild the biological
basis

17
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:07,550
all of the of the month

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,180
the story of the mind

19
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,259
includes the study of mind and body

20
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:15,410
and that means to study

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:20,620
now the nervous system is a biological
structure and as you remember a from

22
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,130
your high school biology

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,670
biological structures are hierarchically
organized

24
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,180
we began had to sell level which your
remember is the

25
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,729
through all smallest most elementary
piece of living matter

26
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,320
that can live independently

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,909
cells

28
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,080
groups are related sales combined to
form tissues

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,429
groups of related tissues combine to
form oregon's

30
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:48,840
groups of related oregon's combined to
form systems

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,659
and there are a whole bunch of different
systems

32
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,110
that make up the individual

33
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,000
human organism

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,110
for humans and most other animals as
well there are a bunch of different

35
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,430
systems in the body the nervous system
is only one of them

36
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,350
there's the endocrine system in the
musculoskeletal system and the

37
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,859
respiratory system and all of that

38
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:13,450
were going to be conference learn

39
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,439
archimedes lectures

40
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,349
the nervous system pretty exclusively

41
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:21,030
but as the over text book makes clear

42
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,749
there are ordered that the nervous
system is connected to all other systems

43
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:25,690
fortier

44
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,610
and are particularly interested in are
the connections between the nervous

45
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,659
system on the one hand

46
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:33,800
and the immune and the endocrine systems

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,769
on the of on the other hand

48
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:40,400
okay sold under our system is one such
system

49
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,669
and as a biological system it truly is
higher record hierarchically organized

50
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,349
at these fellows level

51
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:51,849
we have these structures known as no
runs

52
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:55,799
nor under the elementary structures in
at the nervous system

53
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:00,350
then we have groups of neurones combined
in the tissue level

54
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,739
tecum to formal somewhat larger
structures

55
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,579
known as nerves

56
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:11,519
and again leo and nuclei all describe
those a little bit more in a moment

57
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,630
then bunches of nerves and ganglia and
nuclei

58
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,940
format the oregon level

59
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,980
the major structures of the nervous
system

60
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,329
the brain the spinal cord

61
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,239
and at the brainstem

62
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,889
and that the system level it turns out
that there are

63
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:29,239
not does not just one nervous system

64
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,940
but there are several different nervous
systems the nervous system itself

65
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,299
is hierarchically organized

66
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,909
we can distinguish at the outset

67
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:44,089
between the central nervous system which
consists of the brain and the spinal

68
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:45,739
cord

69
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,380
and indeed peripheral nervous system

70
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,980
which consists of all to other nervous
systems

71
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,380
known as the semantic nervous system

72
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,609
and the autonomic nervous system

73
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,299
basically the peripheral nervous system
although that part of a system that

74
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,369
connects too

75
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:03,150
central

76
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,080
owner of a system

77
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,209
and then all of this staff

78
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,179
these that these different aspects of
the nervous system combined with the

79
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:10,049
other

80
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,510
all bottling systems

81
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,390
to create

82
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,749
the organism

83
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:17,629
as the individual

84
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:22,279
so here's one of your on looks like this
is a schematic diagram of under on perot

85
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:25,189
wants a different kinds of iran's
becoming somewhat different shapes and

86
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:26,210
sizes

87
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,839
but they all have the same kinds of
uh... of structures associated with them

88
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,980
there is a cell body

89
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,129
these structures known as dendrites
branching out from the cell body

90
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,900
then there is a warning of

91
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,869
filament like

92
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:42,350
on tax ein

93
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,590
and then the acts on and said what are
known as terminal endings

94
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,580
which preval look like that and rights
i'll let you know in reverse

95
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,539
neurons com in three basic types

96
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,090
there are first

97
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,699
afa renewal ron's

98
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,309
which although process sensory
information

99
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:04,280
basically carrying neural impulses

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,049
from the sensory receptors in the

101
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:09,159
twilight ear without

102
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:11,370
bono's are the are your whatever

103
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,710
in toward the central nervous system

104
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,639
then there are different

105
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,479
no-refunds

106
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,810
which carry

107
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,110
motor impulses out from the central
nervous system

108
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,530
to the effector organs of the body like
the muscles in the tendons and the

109
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,310
internal organs and so on

110
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,760
and then that there are interneurons

111
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,880
which comprise

112
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,510
the central nervous system

113
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,449
a large parts of the spinal cord

114
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,789
or and the brain and the brain stem

115
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,829
well here in africa ron

116
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:46,420
handling sensory functions

117
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,450
and eastern or on penalty motor
functions

118
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,559
or an internal ron running between the
africa the free world

119
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,009
art this is the basic structure all
neurons look-alike

120
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,210
from this point of view

121
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,479
a cell body with dendrites branching off

122
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,160
and acts on connecting to

123
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,499
terminal

124
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:10,039
uh... terminal fibers

125
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,580
as far as behaviorist concern

126
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:18,409
the smallest unit in the nervous system
is what's known as the reflex arc the

127
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:22,159
reflex arc is kind of an abstract term
there isn't actually such a thing in the

128
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:23,069
nervous system

129
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:26,909
but you get the idea of when you
understand you consider that the reflex

130
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:27,660
arc

131
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,400
concerns arvo

132
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,930
one aspirin or on

133
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,050
processing

134
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,279
sensory activities processing sensation

135
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,789
one different

136
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:39,969
nor on processing

137
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,720
bodily responses

138
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,960
and one intern or on

139
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,419
connecting

140
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:48,069
the effort nor on with the e for immoral

141
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:50,490
reflex arc you'll see an application of
this

142
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,059
or in a in a larger of the scale in a
couple of minutes

143
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:55,370
all but basically

144
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,810
what the reflex arc dawes is to mediate

145
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,080
the organisms motor response

146
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,219
to an environmental stimulus

147
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:05,400
to pick up

148
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,530
through the censoring or on the after a
new rod

149
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,400
information about what's going on in the
environment

150
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
process in through the internal run

151
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,939
connected to the different know ron

152
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:19,470
are generates some kind of response

153
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,879
to that

154
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,119
environmental event

155
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:26,139
and it turns out that the larger
structures in the nervous system

156
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:28,520
are composed of all

157
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,710
variously

158
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,589
afferent

159
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:33,210
different and injure neurons

160
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,379
so all the nerves

161
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:39,360
the nerves in your arms and your all
legs and and elsewhere

162
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,259
or composed although bathrooms andy for
nora stats with nerves are made out of

163
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:47,740
and then we have these are structures

164
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,540
known as dangling ella and nuclei

165
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,989
which are composed of

166
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,209
interneurons

167
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,000
okay more central ought to shoe the
distinction which

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,840
i don't think i've ever held anybody
responsible for but you will see these

169
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,529
terms in the literature

170
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:06,300
dangling out the term ganglia generally
refers to

171
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,349
all clusters of internal runs

172
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:11,020
that reside outside of the brain

173
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,569
and the spinal cord

174
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:19,569
whereas nuclei refer to of clusters of
interneurons the reside inside the brain

175
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:21,949
and spinal cord

176
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,300
the basic level of the nervous system
three kinds of no runs afferent neurons

177
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,189
processing sensory information

178
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,570
if ur in or on the processing motor
information

179
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,479
interneurons connecting the two

180
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,749
the three

181
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,170
types of neurons together comprising

182
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:44,260
the reflex arc which processed these ons
response to an environmental stimulus

183
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,309
and then put the tissue levels

184
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:52,339
you have nervous composed of africa
reefer and a runs nuclei and ganglia

185
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,390
composed of avenger morons

186
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,570
so now let's move up one level

187
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,680
from the tissue level closer to the
order level

188
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,670
and what got the major divisions of the
nervous system

189
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,850
i've already introduced this to you
alcohol uh... in an earlier slide but

190
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,170
just to repeat myself the major division
the nervous system is between the

191
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,190
central nervous system on the one hand
and the peripheral nervous system on the

192
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,180
other hand

193
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,940
the central nervous system consisting of
the brain

194
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,219
the spinal cord and the brain stem which

195
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:26,230
connects them

196
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,320
the peripheral nervous system consisting
of

197
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,700
subordinate nervous systems

198
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,429
the simatic nervous system

199
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:34,560
which runs

200
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,270
between the central nervous system

201
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,470
and the sensory receptors

202
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,940
in the year the nose and throat the eye

203
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,060
and also inferno runs

204
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,490
that broad

205
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,560
the muscles and pendants in the in the
body

206
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,789
and then finally

207
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:54,660
there is an automatically nervous system
which connects the central nervous

208
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:54,980
system

209
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,299
to the internal organs compo controls
the functioning of

210
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,720
the heart belongs and all other kinds of
organs

211
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,670
you couldn't turn down like down a
little bit if you want

212
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,150
or not

213
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,970
so now let's work on the autonomic
nervous system and see how cats

214
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,600
organized

215
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,380
you're going to get a picture here of
what we think this is hierarchical

216
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,269
organizations that are ninth agree

217
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:21,570
because it turns out

218
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,290
that there are two components to the
autonomic nervous system

219
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,690
the sympathetic nervous system

220
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,480
is that part of the autonomic nervous
system

221
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,330
organizes the body to me to email
urgency when a stressful event occurs

222
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,430
when a surprising event occurs when
anything unexpected occurs

223
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,720
what happens is that the sympathetic
nervous system

224
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,680
kicks in

225
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,879
octopodes enable the organism

226
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,310
to deal with whatever

227
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,050
is going on

228
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,279
first the sympathetic nervous system

229
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,699
on mediates what's known as the flight
or fight

230
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:58,610
response

231
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,830
usually especially if you're a little
animal wondered arrival mht

232
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,860
all what you're trying to do is either
defend your territory against all other

233
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,320
alleles of your species or you're trying
to prevent yourself from being eaten by

234
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,649
big around al's of another species and
to be all the sympathetic nervous system

235
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:20,060
on mediates that flight or flight
response

236
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,240
all that's a classic are terms but in
the literature since nineteen teens

237
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,400
more recently rediscovered

238
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,310
another emergency response that's
mediated by the sympathetic nervous

239
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,240
system

240
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,540
which is what's known as tandem and be
friend

241
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,479
or some all-female in some organisms

242
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:40,460
it's the email displease she's

243
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,940
that prepares for flight or fight

244
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,289
female the species

245
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:48,530
tends to engage in what's called tended
to be friend in behavior

246
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,810
looking to the young

247
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,720
all or providing all support

248
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,880
all four of the other ralph we're going
around and again that's a disarm worlds

249
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,290
the sex difference

250
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,699
or that you find in psalm

251
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:04,600
arkansas mammalian species

252
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,930
all but whether you're male or female
all gault rap or most or a cat or dog

253
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,540
species

254
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,439
the sympathetic nervous system

255
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:14,089
all also has the function

256
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:17,090
of generating of national ozell

257
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,939
and it does that by stimulating

258
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,190
the flow of aid hormone adrenaline

259
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,559
through the blood stream

260
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,530
through the various auto internal organs

261
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,439
although sympathetic arousal

262
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:35,550
all helps the organism either margin
sees but it also produces all of the or

263
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,790
arousal of the various emotions and the
through the release of another hormone

264
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,249
nor adrenaline releases shorter stored
all barley sugars

265
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:47,779
into the bloodstream

266
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,580
and of course those bottles of blood
sugars go right to the muscles

267
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,460
and enable the organism

268
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,279
to engage in

269
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,360
flavor flight

270
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,420
tend to be friend

271
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,520
affectively

272
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,130
also

273
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,069
some of the last thing the sympathetic
nervous system does work activated

274
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:08,670
is to reach shuttle the flow of the
blood

275
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,359
away from the surface of the body

276
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:13,129
towards the internal organs

277
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:17,820
and that has the effect or palm uh...

278
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,810
reducing

279
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,740
blood loss

280
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,370
incase your wounded

281
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,730
case you don't make it in the

282
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,580
flight or floyd uh... response

283
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,490
all-black

284
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,830
there is sudden visits as sympathetic
branch of the all oregon it never system

285
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,490
that does all these things

286
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,489
basically all engaging an emotional
roles all

287
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:39,260
and all of their risk behaviors

288
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,740
that allow the organism to meet

289
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,790
emergencies

290
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,609
parasympathetic nervous system

291
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:47,740
by contrast

292
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,979
basically is engaged in

293
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:52,010
palm org

294
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,720
mediating vegetative functions of
various kinds

295
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,089
if the parasympathetic nervous system

296
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:58,880
that handles things like

297
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,550
digestion of food

298
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,750
the elimination

299
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,170
of waste

300
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,500
reproductive behaviors

301
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,100
and so on

302
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,030
sympathetic

303
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,320
nervous system

304
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,420
emotional arousal

305
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,490
flight or fight

306
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,040
tend to be friend

307
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,180
parasympathetic nervous system hall of
basically mediates

308
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,400
vegetative functions of the body

309
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,389
that's not quite cold there is to it
however

310
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:22,849
because it turns out

311
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:25,100
that the parasympathetic nervous system

312
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,279
is also involved in the organisms

313
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,390
response to

314
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,040
stress ors response to emergencies

315
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,029
but the all parasympathetic nervous
system

316
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:38,509
only comes into play in emergencies

317
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:39,790
in response

318
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:44,100
to are arousal off the sympathetic
nervous system

319
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,299
it turns out

320
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:48,540
that when the organism reacts to stress

321
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,320
the parasympathetic and the sympathetic
nervous systems

322
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,270
activex kind of antagonistic matter

323
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,660
they basically poll the organism

324
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,960
enough opposite on directions

325
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,600
so for example

326
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,650
let's look at called sympathetic
activity

327
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,410
when your

328
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,720
oh when your own exposed to some kind of
stress or

329
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,579
the sympathetic nervous system

330
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:13,959
dilated pupils of the i_r_a_ inhibits
tearing

331
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,259
inhibits elevation when you're nervous

332
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:19,410

333
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,089
arlene inhibit stomach and contractions

334
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,960
or relaxes the bladder

335
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,630
really get nervous you might wet
yourself

336
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,079
although inhibits off at the general
russians and so on

337
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,230
but look what parasympathetic style
system does when the sympathetic nervous

338
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,830
system is diluting the peoples of the
ali

339
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,869
the parasympathetic nervous system is
constricting

340
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:41,900
the pupils of the airline

341
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,359
when the sympathetic nervous system is
inhibiting the salvation

342
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,739
the parasympathetic of the system

343
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,570
is is on stimulating or the celebration

344
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,220
so what happens here

345
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,300
when you are stressed when you're all
when you would counter some stressful

346
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,449
event in the environment

347
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:01,129
the first thing that happens

348
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:05,120
is at the sympathetic nervous system
kicks in and it does all these things at

349
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,160
once at acs ads a unit

350
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,890
without every rapid onset comes on very
quickly

351
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,540
and

352
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,150
also has a very rapid offset

353
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,870
if you're almost

354
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,389
running across the field

355
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:23,240
and you see the shuttle hawk you're
sympathetic nervous system kicks in to

356
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,080
enable you know it will run from the
hawker whatever

357
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,980
as soon as the hawk is out of sight or
whatever what happens is that the

358
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,250
sympathetic nervous system turns itself
off the very fast okay

359
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:40,140
but what happens is all the sympathetic
nervous system or activity

360
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,500
tend be friend really seen store blood
sugars all that stuff

361
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,830
deeply bodily resources

362
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,850
and so you've got to have some system
that will act to restore those resources

363
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,550
for the next emerg emergency the comes
around

364
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,509
and that's what the parasympathetic
nervous system

365
00:16:58,509 --> 00:16:59,139
does

366
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:01,050
in response to or

367
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,070
in environmental stress or

368
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,550
parasympathetic nervous system

369
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,079
on discrete pieces of the body at once

370
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,889
it acts discriminative lee

371
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:14,210
all the where it's really needed

372
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,380
moreover

373
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,039
parasympathetic nervous system

374
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,150
has a relatively slow onset

375
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,740
the sympathetic nervous system has to
kick in immediately or you're gonna get

376
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,159
eaten

377
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:25,950
okay

378
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:30,059
but it's going to take you would want to
come to consume those partly resources

379
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,020
so the sympathetic nervous system

380
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,550
doesn't have to act so fast

381
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,600
moreover once the emergency is passed

382
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,010
you have to do anything okay

383
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,890
but sympathetic paris embedded nervous
system

384
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,230
has to continue to work for a while

385
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,270
to restore the bodily resources that
were depleted when you were a meeting of

386
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,470
what when you were a lot of the meeting
the of the emergency

387
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,419
so what happens is when is the stressful
event

388
00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:00,909
and walking across campus on guerrilla
jumps out of the bushes or something

389
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:03,530
your sympathetic nervous system kicks
off

390
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,430
of the media rate

391
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,370
okay and as your running away from the
guerilla in a paris a bit nervous system

392
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,060
will start working little bit

393
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,750
then when your off ordered safe from the
animal

394
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,090
on your sympathetic nervous system trent
itself all pretty quickly

395
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,980
but the parasympathetic nervous system
keeps going for a while to get those

396
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,880
partly resources resources of blood
sugars and all that other stuff

397
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,740
all going on going together

398
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,040
and that's why for example

399
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,730
when the your

400
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,530
exposed to some kind of acute stress or
when the stress or goes away sometimes

401
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:44,330
you feel like you crashed a little bit
right well that's because

402
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,600
as the sympathetic nervous system is
trying to wind you up

403
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,020
okay the parasympathetic nervous system

404
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,750
is trying to want to go

405
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,799
the antagonistic

406
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,870
all or interplay of the sympathetic and
parasympathetic

407
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,840
dawn nervous systems for example

408
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,919
all the accounts for

409
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,929
funny are dynamics of addiction

410
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:04,890
okay where

411
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,539
all if you would call it

412
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,390
ingested it uh... you know

413
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,520
an addictive drug

414
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,720
may feel good for a while but then when
the drug wears off you don't just go

415
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,789
back to normal you crash

416
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,470
okay the crash

417
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,580
crashes mediated

418
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,460
by the continue with activity of the
parasympathetic nervous system

419
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,369
so that's what i have to say it right
now about the autonomic nervous system

420
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,160
basis two functions

421
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,210
ald prepare alag mediating the organisms
response the stress

422
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,219
and also mediating various kinds of
educator functions

423
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:46,219
any questions about your nervous system

424
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,460
okay remember if you have questions
about lectures are reading at any time

425
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,420
you can always post them

426
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,970
the court's website

427
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,020
and all will and don't get to the

428
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,010
okay so that's the on the other part of
a system

429
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,660
let's look at these american nervous
system

430
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,290
which consists of

431
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,360
the nerves

432
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,860
that run to nerves are run children from
the brain and the spinal cord

433
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,710
in fact there are

434
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,710
of thirty one spinal nerves

435
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,400
so-called because they emanate from a
the spinal cord these are all spinal

436
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,100
nerves

437
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,450
on here

438
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,559
and then there are twelve cranial nerves

439
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,450
so-called

440
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,279
because today of emanate from the brain
or do you know

441
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:34,170
or the brainstem

442
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:34,890
or

443
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,030
here is the biggest verbal talk about
that made it

444
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,480
on which actually comes out of the brain
stem the goes into the trunk

445
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,450
of the body

446
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,460
but that's basically what the somatic
nervous system all looks like

447
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,090
those two major divisions

448
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,710
the cranial nerves

449
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,090
and the spinal nerves

450
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,030
the cranial nerves are highly
specialized structures

451
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,470
they're highly specialized in terms of
the functions

452
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,830
they perform

453
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,690
there are some all cranial nerves

454
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,250
that are exclusively aspirin

455
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,360
in nature

456
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,340
that is they are devoted

457
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:16,490
to processing sensory impulses arising
from various sensory receptors and

458
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,359
taking them

459
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,280
toward the central nervous system

460
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,330
so for example you've got

461
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,080
alm cranial nerve one the so-called
olfactory nerve

462
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,260
that runs

463
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,789
from but knowles

464
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,909
essentially from the nose into the brain

465
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:32,400
and mediates the sense of smell

466
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,379
cranial nerve to the optic nerve

467
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:39,030
runs from the retinas of the eyes to the
brain

468
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,960
and mediates the sense of vision

469
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,399
so some of the cranial nerves these are
just two examples

470
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:47,420
are exclusively aspirins in nature

471
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,889
in that day

472
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:49,560
mediate

473
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,169
only sensory

474
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:52,910
or impulses

475
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:58,970
by the same token there are some nerves
that are exclusively different in nature

476
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,269
which is to say

477
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:02,399
that there on the other point started

478
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:07,850
they control motorists motor behaviors
of various role in various ways

479
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:13,060
here's one cranial nerve three the
ocular motor on her all moves the

480
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,809
audience

481
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:16,500
when you move your eyes back-and-forth
up-and-down

482
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,110
so on all that's or being done by the
ocular motor ger

483
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,190
here's another one

484
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,030
or cranial nerve twelve the
hypoglycaemia her

485
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,450
which has the of function of moving the
tongue

486
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,700
so when you talk when you eat

487
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,270
when you do some other stuff

488
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:37,510
you do it by virtue of the of the hype a
colossal mirror

489
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,799
and then finally just to make things a
little confusing

490
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,520
there are some cranial nerves

491
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,429
are mixed in nature because they combine

492
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:49,960
afarensis andy friend functions

493
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,909
so brady on the reply

494
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:56,780
the tribe general mirror mediates the
sense of touch

495
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,300
around

496
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,210
the face and the aural cavity

497
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,740
also that that it's afrin function

498
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,429
but it's different for sure

499
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:07,130
is to mediate

500
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,990
chilling activity when you chew on your
food

501
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,480
all you're doing it by virtue of home

502
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,210
at the french impulse is being carried
by the tried jumble more

503
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,730
here's another one

504
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,799
hooked on cranial nerves seven the
facial nerve it's afrin function

505
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,570
is to mediate the sense of taste

506
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,030
for connects the

507
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,329
taste buds and other receptors in the
tongue

508
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:31,789
home

509
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:33,210
to the brain

510
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,000
so that you could taste your food

511
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,080
and then

512
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,740
facial bone facial nerve

513
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,070
all seven as a different nerve

514
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,539
all mediates the movement of the phrase
when you smile

515
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:48,520
when you for our when you start or what
you do what you do with your face

516
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,619
all you do it by virtue of

517
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:52,100
the you foreign

518
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,710
aspect of the ill of the cranial nerve

519
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:59,039
so again these cranial nerves are highly
specialized

520
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,739
some are exclusively afferent in nature
summer exclusively you for into major

521
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:07,420
and all others are mixed

522
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,960
body contrast

523
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,080
the spinal nerves all combine

524
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,530
afferent

525
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,220
and evil and

526
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:15,890
sensory

527
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,059
and motor

528
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,820
are here is a all schematic diagram of

529
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,880
on nerve of spinal nerve connecting to

530
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,870
beall the spinal cord

531
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,980
and most of you can probably see this

532
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,890
there are in fact

533
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,490
roots

534
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,420
of this spinal nerve

535
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,790
one route carrying sensory information
from the receptors from the center

536
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:44,669
receptors in towards his spinal cord and
there is another route

537
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:46,020
that is carrying

538
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,929
different motor information

539
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:50,710
onto dude to generate a motor response

540
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,960
all contacted that's the eastwind

541
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,890
all of the year old of the spine

542
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,080
although the splendor

543
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,740
all basically that's the idea date each
of these idle nerves combine offering

544
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,519
two different functions

545
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:07,320
running along

546
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,160
branches and different

547
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,860
pathways

548
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,790
here are the thirty one spinal nerves
you don't have to memorize this this is

549
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,330
in the human anatomy course but i do
want you to have some sense of what the

550
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,860
nervous system all of the looks like

551
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,960
and one of the things you should note is
is that

552
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,789
their is a regular association

553
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:31,390
between a part of the body

554
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,270
that is served by a spinal nerve

555
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,650
and whereabouts biomarker next to the
spinal cord

556
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,749
so what here

557
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:42,640
you have the cervical division

558
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,340
the spinal cord which basically all
hands on

559
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,020
fallout

560
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,230
own nerves there right now to the arms
and hands and the

561
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,050
and the fingers ok up here

562
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,919
then there's the forensic division

563
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,869
all which told the spinal nerves busy
running to the internal organs of the

564
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,110
body

565
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,929
and then down here at the lombard sacral
division

566
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:09,070
and all of the uh...

567
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,990
on that the others

568
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,539
carry the nerves that operate the legs

569
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,230
and beyond and defeat

570
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,529
okay so first

571
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:19,600
there's a regular association

572
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,320
between

573
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,100
the part of the body third by a spinal
nerve

574
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,990
and where it connects to a to the spinal
cord

575
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,389
the author interesting feature of the
spinal nerves

576
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:31,599
is that there is a kind of

577
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,590
proportional representation

578
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,899
there are more spinal mirrors devoted

579
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:38,960
to those parts of the body

580
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,760
they either need to acute censoring

581
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,600
function

582
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,679
over

583
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:46,820
fine motor control

584
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,380
so you've got lots of mirrors

585
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,110
that run to the arms in the hands and
the fingers

586
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,270
and you've got

587
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,920
lots of mirrors that run to the legs and
defeat as opposed

588
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,379
all of but not so many that run too

589
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:03,190
beyond

590
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,830
to the trunk of the chest cavity of the
body

591
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,159
more nerves

592
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,510
where you need either fine sensitivity
flying tactile sensitivity

593
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:16,600
flying of fine motor

594
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,050
and so that's basically

595
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,550
how that is organized will come back to
this and uh... you know

596
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,460
in a second

597
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,190
uh... fit this except to say

598
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,770
all

599
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,460
there are

600
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,480
within the spinal cord itself

601
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,630
there are

602
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,680
several different tracks

603
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,100
these are they've been read here and
what are known as the a's sending

604
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,899
tracked of the nervous system above the
spinal cord as carrying

605
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:43,370
after rent impulses

606
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,800
upto spinal cord to the brain

607
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,929
denim blue here we have the descending
tracts of the power in the spinal cord

608
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:54,940
caring even friend impulses

609
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,620
down okay that's what's called
descending and out to the motor all

610
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,539
parts and then the rest of this
basically is

611
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:04,950
all of the association tissue

612
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,950
on this is a these are essentially

613
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,260
composed of africa ron's distract

614
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,220
these distract composed mostly of you
for an iran's

615
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,470
these tracks

616
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,460
composed essentially volvo

617
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,160
of the internet

618
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:25,710
so what happens here is at the spinal
cord ok is where the brain connects with

619
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,570
the rest of the body where mess where
the the brain

620
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,609
prostheses

621
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:35,660
tactile sensations what you're feeling
what you're talking and also generates

622
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,820
the motions

623
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,680
of the legs of the arms in the hands and
the and the nerves

624
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,060
let's look for a second the implications
of some of this

625
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:52,060
for what happens when somebody's suffers
a break in the spinal cord

626
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,440
that the spinal cord

627
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,600
is carrying african polls is off to the
brain and it's carrying you've rented

628
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,030
impulses down from the brain

629
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,440
weapon there's a break in the spinal
cord

630
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,530
those impulses stop

631
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:09,670
there's no way for them to get across
break in the spinal cord

632
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,950
so that when people suffer a break in
the spinal cord

633
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,440
date paul manifesting neurological
syndrome

634
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,580
that is known as parallel major

635
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,500
paraplegia

636
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,019
which involves

637
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:27,470
both all also sensory function and all
lost of voluntary

638
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,559
of movement

639
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,670
so if there is a

640
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,090
breaking the spinal cord

641
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,320
here somewhere in the parece activision

642
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,000
the person will be able to

643
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,200
feel things with his or her hands

644
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,330
and move his or her hands because my
hands are mu are or or controlled

645
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,470
body on

646
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,910
spinal nerves are above the break

647
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,500
the person will be paralyzed

648
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,890
fog with respect to

649
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,190
the legs and defeat and the toes

650
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,619
and we'll also have

651
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:58,409
no tactile

652
00:29:58,409 --> 00:29:58,980
sensation

653
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,040
from that part of the body

654
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,910
all what happens ok when you're when
you're flannel cord is broken why don't

655
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,800
you just

656
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,830
died

657
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,470
the reason for that is

658
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,390
see this vegas nerve that i pointed out
before

659
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,960
that's cranial nerve

660
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,949
art and that is very very very high up

661
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,909
and it's the biggest nerve that
different keeps

662
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:23,340
of the heart our and other

663
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,159
essential baat

664
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,570
vital functions on going

665
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:33,789
when somebody aqua suffers from
paraplegia they lose sensation from the

666
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:37,630
affected part of the body that is the
part of the body that is below the break

667
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,140
in the spinal cord

668
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,379
they also lose

669
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:43,670
voluntary motion ma movement

670
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:47,370
are from of the in areas below the break
in the spinal cord

671
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,010
but they do not lose

672
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,380
all

673
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,720
bathrooms any further processing

674
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,090
even in cases of paraplegia up

675
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,460
you can see maintained

676
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,090
some stimulus response connections

677
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:05,360
and he's the most response connections
or known as the spiral reflexes

678
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,950
and they're known as a spinal reflexes
because they are processed solely act

679
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:14,100
all level of the spinal cord itself

680
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,039
you'll you'll lead

681
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,680
we think about

682
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,539
all the pactel

683
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:19,650
stalled but

684
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,650
of the touch sensation

685
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:25,580
coming up the legs going up the spinal
cord to the brain the brain generate a

686
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,820
motor responsibilites down the spinal
cord and out the thrown out the spinal

687
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,520
nerves

688
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,570
that's true for voluntary motor
activities

689
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:38,900
but there are certain involuntary motor
responses all reflex responses that are

690
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,620
process

691
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,320
solely at the level of the spinal cord

692
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,140
one of these is the so-called patellar
reflex

693
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,450
probably all of you of experienced in
the doctor's office

694
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,510
you tap the patellar tendon

695
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,270
your get a little

696
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,740
jerk reflex colognes on here

697
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,360
that is alle

698
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,580
common all part of our

699
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,470
neurological uh... diagnostic test

700
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,809
and that's

701
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:06,670
dot maintain remains intact

702
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,230
in paraplegic of patience

703
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,940
but these vinyl ulm reflexes

704
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,410
have certified interesting properties

705
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,799
the first is

706
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:18,570
that's why uh... reflexes in

707
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,589
cases of spinal cord injury

708
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:22,750
tend to be exaggerated

709
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:28,470
they tend to be stronger then the spinal
reflexes in individuals with an intact

710
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,620
spinal cord

711
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,870
it's as if

712
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:37,870
da brain is sending signals down the
spinal cord that modulate or dampen the

713
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,049
activity of the spinal reflexes

714
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:43,919
when the brain can no longer communicate
with that part of a spinal cord

715
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:44,739
spinal cord

716
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:47,740
zala the spinal cords left with soem
devices

717
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,019
it it gives i more exaggerated

718
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:52,299
uh... response

719
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:57,730
another characteristic of the spinal
reflexes is that they are unconscious

720
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,880
because they are processed slowly at the
level of the spinal cord

721
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,340
nothing about this activity reaches

722
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,840
the brain which is the seat of
consciousness

723
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,650
a person will not

724
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,359
no that he or she is engaging

725
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,590
in the

726
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,290
paraplegic individual won't be directly
aware that he he or she is giving one of

727
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:21,250
the spinal reflexes so if you had a home

728
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,250
offers for the spinal cord injury

729
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,590
and you blindfolded and so they couldn't
see what you're doing

730
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,210
tap their patellar tendon they give the
patellar reflex

731
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,020
but they would neither feel the tap

732
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,330
nor would they be aware

733
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,130
all their all of their legs moving

734
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,129
so all of these final reflexes are
exaggerated

735
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:40,339
they're unconscious

736
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:42,370
and they are also

737
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,820
involuntary

738
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,330
with my impact spinal cord level are not
going to give the patellar reflex i'm

739
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:53,010
not going to do and i'm not going to do
it so you couldn't do it

740
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,409
got some voluntary control over this
thing

741
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:59,490
but when there's a break in the spinal
cord that voluntary controls lost cassie

742
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,390
inhibitory messages

743
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,150
can't get down spinal cord

744
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:03,779
moreover

745
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:06,570
here are not happy my patellar tendon

746
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,290
moving my leg just fine

747
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,859
can't do that

748
00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:12,679
in case of paraplegia because that
requires

749
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:15,440
a signal that submission dated in the
brain

750
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,199
to go down the spinal cord

751
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,839
and it just can't

752
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,210
too

753
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,849
to the centers

754
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:26,730
so basically that's the story with
respect to

755
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,100
the also matic nervous system

756
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,599
and its branches cranial nerves

757
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,139
and at the spinal nerves

758
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:39,059
anne questions what that gap

759
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:43,619
hemi pleaser is not usually caused by a
break in the spinal cord

760
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:47,129
henny please show up to him at least of
my knowledge all stand corrected over

761
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:48,490
here in a second

762
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:52,659
heritage is usually something you see in
cases of stroke

763
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:56,719
where a person has had a vascular
insufficiency the blood supply to the

764
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,849
brains been cut off

765
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:01,400
and some part of the brain has basically

766
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,219
destroyed

767
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:05,459
and what happens is in many cases of
stroke

768
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:09,219
all of that vascular insufficiency
affects only one

769
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:11,599
part of the brain or another

770
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,499
and we're going to discuss this today
we're going to discuss that next

771
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:15,299
wednesday

772
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:20,269
but although there is a principle of
well nervous system organization

773
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:23,480
con trolled lateral projection

774
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,639
contra

775
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,720
lateral okay

776
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,859
other side projection

777
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,079
and to make a long story short

778
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,229
you're left cerebral hemisphere

779
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:34,009
controls the right side of your body

780
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:37,659
you're right cerebral hemisphere
controls the left side of your body

781
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:38,440
so

782
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,190
if u had a stroke

783
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:44,070
that is damaged certain centers in your
left hemisphere

784
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,599
you'll lose

785
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,650
some functions

786
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,900
did the right side of the body but not
on the left side of the body so you'll

787
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,239
have weakness

788
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:56,629
all everybody by watchdog what the
senator tim johnson last night on the

789
00:35:56,629 --> 00:35:58,409
news

790
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:01,390
dave i watch the news

791
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:05,369
they gotta watch the news ok all gotta
watch law-and-order reruns but you've

792
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:07,179
also got to watch the news

793
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:07,980
of

794
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,810
some of you may remembered that dog
senator tim johnson oliver north dakota

795
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,559
upto

796
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:15,000
eight months ago

797
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,539
suffered a brain hemorrhage not a stroke
exactly but something like a stroke

798
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:23,279
all and what happened was that on that
dawn

799
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:27,659
stroke affected hit the lovely brain
hemorrhage with localized in his left

800
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:29,559
cerebral hemisphere

801
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:33,619
alm and what it did was to basically
wipeout

802
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:35,799
on his orbs on

803
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:36,560
person three

804
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,629
pactel and motor functions on the right
side

805
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:44,269
uh... but also going to talk about this
later on to language functions tend to

806
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:47,249
be localized in the left's ribble
hemisphere so we lost the ability to

807
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:49,719
speak

808
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:53,109
after eight months of intensive
rehabilitation those of you saw the news

809
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:54,390
last night

810
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,100
sort of senator johnson

811
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,689
speaks okay

812
00:36:57,689 --> 00:37:01,719
he's not going to give all bigsby
trouble for the senate anytime soon but

813
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,829
he could communicate

814
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:06,509
alm

815
00:37:06,509 --> 00:37:10,039
but called that as the you know if the
problem

816
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:14,679
tim johnson the or a_b_c_ medical
consultant in such a group of uh...

817
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:18,879
c_n_n_ medical consultant pointed out he
has a lot of weakness on his right side

818
00:37:18,879 --> 00:37:19,340
argued

819
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,279
use the wheelchair he could get up

820
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:23,969
but he's very weakened his right side

821
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:25,960
com that's kind of a heavy preacher

822
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,259
it's because the damage was in the left
part of the spring

823
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:30,679
dancer

824
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:33,830
sometimes i give you more about answer

clear answer

840
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:20,720
all i had something else down here

841
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,219
ya the eastern or on czar for all
intents and purposes connected the

842
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:29,999
muscles

843
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:34,229
in the same way that the aspirin or ons
are connected to

844
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,729
center receptors like

845
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:40,319

breweries in the form of his work the
way they do is to say

848
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,519
connected well falls

849
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:49,969
the reason the africa runs work the way
they do

850
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:51,279
is that they pick up

851
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:53,230
the probate uk ferry

852
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:59,940
sensory impulses that arise in the
center receptors in the bottom

853
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,640

i'll take another question to win will
you have

855
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:11,929
it all depends on the extent of the
damage

856
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:13,000
you could have

857
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,730
they injury to the spinal cord

858
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,339
okay

859
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:19,829
that doesn't actually destroyed tissue

860
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:24,449
there there's some capacity for nervous
sought that nervous tissue to recover

861
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:25,209
function

862
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:27,900
or you can have a bruise or something
and apple

863
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,090
double temporarily all all result of
that kind of loss of function we're

864
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,380
talking here

865
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:34,760
about

866
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,809
they kat in the spinal cord not an
injury

867
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:43,179
although there are exceptions i talk
about this a little bit the lecture

868
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:46,529
supplement that glavin talks about a
little bit in his chapter three

869
00:39:46,529 --> 00:39:51,969
for all intents and purposes central
nervous system damage is permanent

870
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:53,129
gone forever

871
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:54,769
okay

872
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:56,509
where your helmets

873
00:39:56,509 --> 00:39:57,910
where here

874
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,259
shoulder pads

don't know what's underneath you
