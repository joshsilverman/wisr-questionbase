1
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:14,169
okay last time wiki began our
consideration of processes involved in

2
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:15,229
thinking

3
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:17,630
reasoning and problem solving

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,260
judgment and decision making

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,740
and i began with a basic carter problem

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,190
wonder comes up all the time which is
how we form a categories to begin with

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,450
and how we categorize objects in terms
of all of the categories that we know

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,250
something about

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,380
and i described for you

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,700
to anne

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,900
there as an example of memorable
rationality the classic all proper said

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,219
fueled categories uncategorized ation

13
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:52,920
that has come down to us since the time
of aristotle's psalm twenty five hundred

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,470
years ago

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,780
idea that categories are proper steps

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,390
we are all category members share in
common

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,110
thumbs-up all defining features

18
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,640
and when you want to categorize an
object

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,190
all there's an algorithm

20
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,380
and all you have to do to is too

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,510
all figure out what the features of the
object are

22
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,240
compare those features

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,300
through the list to various lists of all
features at the fine various categories

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,150
and when you find a match between the
features of an object and the defining

25
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,240
features of a category then you solve
the problem you know the object belongs

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,470
in that category

27
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,930
that is a fine idea of plots
prescription for categorization in

28
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,930
principle

29
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,250
but in bless lecturer already

30
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,940
discussed a number of ways in which it
just doesn't work out

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,030
that there is a series of problems

32
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,140
with his classical view of categories as
proper sets

33
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,390
and they seem to be law

34
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,159
okay

35
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,529
as part of categorization is a matter of
using proper sets

36
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:02,189
the wooden encounter these kinds of
problems at all

37
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,410
so what do you know what needs to be
categorized how do we do it

38
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:06,919
tall

39
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:11,640
it turns out we do something to all
other than categorized in terms of

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,040
but think about categories

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,909
in terms of these songs and these
defining features

42
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,580
and warn the

43
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,839
alternative view of categorization

44
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:23,729
wonder you get a lot of mileage out of

45
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:28,620
well i was proposed by berkeley zone
professor eleanor rushed some years ago

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,240
in terms of what's known as the
prototype view

47
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,469
all categories is fuzzy sets

48
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,260
arm

49
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,820
couple things going on here

50
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,470
first inspect categories are construed
as fuzzy sets not process

51
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,840
proper sets recur in the category are
not there are sharp boundaries between

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,689
contrasting categories

53
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:52,780
bargain russia's fauzi so if you have
categorization

54
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,550
but the owner res between adjacent
categories are not all that clear their

55
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,419
fussing

56
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:01,799
although it's not going that's the
reason why it's not clear whether or not

57
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:02,569
or weather

58
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:05,149
a tornado was approved for a vegetable

59
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:09,370
or any religion is an article of
furniture or not

60
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,830
rosh argued that

61
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,750
when we categorize we simply don't
categorize on the basis of defining

62
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,840
features rather we define all good but
we did we categorize on the basis of

63
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,479
what she called

64
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,829
characteristic features

65
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,959
features that are correlated

66
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,620
or category membership

67
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,529
but not perfectly

68
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:32,749
correlated with category membership

69
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:35,630
and in fact she'd yaar distinguished
further

70
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,709
between two kinds of features

71
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,190
that are relevant to categorization

72
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,099
central features which are highly
correlated with category membership

73
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:45,859
and

74
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:46,819
peripheral features

75
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:51,749
which are not so highly correlated with
category membership

76
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:52,990
and she argued

77
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:58,060
federal rather than representing
categories violence of defining features

78
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,420
features that are singly necessary and
jointly sufficient

79
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,599
to define an object is a member of a
category

80
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:08,230
rather what we do is irreparably
represent categories by

81
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,429
are kind of payment type

82
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:13,459
are in a prototype in this all
literature

83
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,040
means a kind of

84
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,430
average

85
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,859
category mem member all over the image
of a category that has lots of features

86
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:24,620
that are central to category membership

87
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,409
and relatively few features that are
central to membership and other

88
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:29,239
categories

89
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,539
all but the point is

90
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:33,300
that the features were used to
categorize objects

91
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,039
may not be the defining features of a
category

92
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:42,339
albendazole warm-blooded vertebrate with
feathers and wings that's the biological

93
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:43,360
definition of a bird

94
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,610
if you've got those four peter zero bird
if you don't have those for future if

95
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,520
you're not over

96
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,340
but then we think about birds

97
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,290
we don't think about bridge that way we
think about birds in terms of

98
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,759
prototypical birds like robbins

99
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,320
as barros

100
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,470
and pigeons

101
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,670
and evils and hawks we have these
prototypes that are mine and when we see

102
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,969
an object

103
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:08,659
that has many of the features

104
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:10,190
other category prototype

105
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,399
we call it a bird

106
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,690
and if we don't

107
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,009
policy those characteristic features

108
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:16,990
we don't call the object bird

109
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,599
which is why we have difficulty thinking
about chickens as birds

110
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:24,009
we have difficulty thinking about pasta
riches as bird

111
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:28,949
we have difficulty thinking about
penguins as birds

112
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:30,709
and this

113
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:32,780
prototype view of categorization

114
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,300
goes a long way towards

115
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,870
solving

116
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,000
the kinds of problems of categorization
that i talked about last time

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,600
for example the prototype view

118
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,520
permits a lot of heterogeneity within a
category it permits you to have a lots

119
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,810
of objects in a category that don't
necessarily look ball like each other

120
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,870
but most important the palm

121
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,880
the yacht the prototype view

122
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,409
allows for typically affects

123
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:02,479
it allows for salma category members

124
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,460
to be more technical

125
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,919
category members them other category
members

126
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:07,810
why

127
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,220
because they more closely resemble
prototypical category instances and

128
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,760
again the important thing here

129
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,789
is that we define

130
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:17,879
foam

131
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:21,139
five categories in terms of these
characteristics features

132
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,379
which are not necessarily the same

133
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,090
as defining features

134
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,030
we think of eagles is birds because they
fly

135
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,469
okay but not all birds fly that's not
part of the biological definition of a

136
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:33,020
bird

137
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,509
we think of a robinson sparrows as birds
because they fly in the same

138
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:41,909
but flying and singing are not defining
features of the category birds

139
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:44,020
let's just one of the purple burglarized

140
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,349
difficult work for example fence and
sings

141
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,359
for instance flies off the fence

142
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,690
does all these kinds of

143
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,839
birdie things

144
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,049
even though that doesn't have anything
to do with being a warm-blooded

145
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:55,449
vertebrate

146
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,539
with feathers and wings

147
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,830
an alternative view of categorization

148
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,829
aldrich dog whiteman talks about a
little bit

149
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:07,669
abandons the view of walla co dot that
is the emphasis on features and

150
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:08,399
fireworks

151
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,449
in the proper sethi through

152
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:14,979
categories were defined by defining
features features over singly necessary

153
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:19,199
in jointly sufficient to define an
object as an instance of a category

154
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,610
in russia is

155
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,119
fuzzy set for you

156
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:27,160
categories were are defined in terms of
prototypical features

157
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,619
features over highly correlated

158
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:31,100
with category membership

159
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,729
but not necessarily perfectly correlated
with category membership and this

160
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:37,159
example our view

161
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,259
basically says

162
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,099
that you just abandon

163
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,619
for the use of features are all instead
you have a category that's

164
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:45,830
representative your mind

165
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,800
as a

166
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,129
relatively short list

167
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:50,469
typical instances

168
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:52,379
so if i see an object

169
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:55,999
and i want to know if it's a bird i
don't inspected to see that sings and

170
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:57,099
flies

171
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:01,039
which are characteristic features of
birds ok why inspected to see if it

172
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,899
looks like a robin or a sterile or in
the eagle or a hawk

173
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,840
and if it is like all of a bird and if
it doesn't

174
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,689
hi all i don't recall the river

175
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:11,430
again

176
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,279
both the product ideal of categorization

177
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,160
and the exemplar view of categorization

178
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,659
depart radically from below

179
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:24,719
article record role classical view of
categories as proper sucks

180
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:26,870
and they owe us straight the distinction

181
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,259
between what you might call logic

182
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,839
trickle approach to categorization

183
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,350
and what you might call the
psychological approach to categorization

184
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,620
there's one way to do things that's
prescribed by flaw sufferers

185
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,220
we're committed to normative rationality

186
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,619
and there's another way

187
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:46,789
to do things

188
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,750
that's described by psychologists

189
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,900
who actually look at hull

190
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,100
the mind works okay

191
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,050
so these problems with categorization

192
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,350
suggest that there's another awaited
view human thought then through the lens

193
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,170
all

194
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,140
on normative rationality and in this
lecture today we're going to see some

195
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,850
other examples of that

196
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:16,820
basically the idea here woods who have
already talked about this let's go on to

197
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:23,240
albright problem of categorization

198
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,560
categorization is always a matter
although judgment

199
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,910
problem solving the problem being to
determine

200
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,810
what category and object belongs in

201
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:39,090
when we think about power problems are
structured and how problems are solved

202
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,610
it turns out

203
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,250
algorithms for judgment or only work for
a specific class the problems known as

204
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,210
well defined problems

205
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,519
well defined problems are ones that are
completely specified

206
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,759
with respect to

207
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:58,180
the initial conditions set by the
problem

208
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,899
the bolt to be reached in the problem

209
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:05,429
and the intermediate operations to be
performed

210
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:07,559
did he knew from the initial conditions

211
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,550
to the goals

212
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,890
problems in elementary algebra

213
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,759
or

214
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,530
of are well-defined

215
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,620
uh... in in exactly the slaying if i
said to you

216
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:24,130
three acts plus three equals twelve and
i want you to solve for x

217
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,190
an algorithm

218
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,059
that'll allow you to do that

219
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,079
you subtract three from both sides of
the equation

220
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,279
and then you divide both sides of the
equation by three

221
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,600
so that you find out

222
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,860
that x equals three

223
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,780
in a problem like this the public this
is well-defined because there is only

224
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,480
one possible representation of the
problem

225
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,830
and there is a only one correct solution
to the problem and there's an algorithm

226
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,320
that'll tell you what that solution is

227
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,480
and all you have to do is apply it

228
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,420
but there are there problems that art
ill-defined

229
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,060
in that they are in one way or another
not completely specified

230
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,700
you with your dole

231
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,540
necessary you don't know all the initial
conditions

232
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,530
you may not know the goal

233
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,120
or you may not know the intermediate
operations

234
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,679
on algebraic example might be ok
unnikrishnan like this

235
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:23,360
three acts plus three white males twelve
on yesterday solve racks

236
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,690
and he can't deliver exactly because the
value of x depends on the value of life

237
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,510
if the if y equals one xd

238
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,700
as one value

239
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,250
if why he pulls too

240
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,790
x has another value

241
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,940
in ill-defined problems

242
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,660
there are many

243
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,259
different possible representations all
of the problem

244
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:48,110
there are many different ways to look at
the problem

245
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,070
and a solution to the problem

246
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,720
is going to be determined

247
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,920
but either way it's represented

248
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,459
the solution of problem

249
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:57,100
is going to be determined

250
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,090
all right

251
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,959
on on

252
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,329
by the are

253
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:02,529
but what you decide to specify

254
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,610
the initial conditions

255
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,240
walls or the intermediate operations for
what have you and the fact of the matter

256
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,939
is

257
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:14,289
that most of the problems that we
encounter in the ordinary course of

258
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:15,409
everyday living

259
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:18,569
more closely resemble build the foreign
problems

260
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:22,039
then well-defined problems ok just about

261
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:25,310
all the kinds of problems that you
encounter

262
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,320
hardly any of them look like

263
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,409
before nobody equations of elementary
algebra

264
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:32,930
okay most of it look like

265
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,319
first thing you have to be rose what the
goal is okay

266
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,889
then you have to have that you have to
figure out what your condemned the

267
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,959
butcher intermediate conditions are

268
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,559
and then you have to figure out how do
you get from point a to point b

269
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,939
all of these things

270
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:49,830
are relatively incompletely specified

271
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,640
in other words

272
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,680
most reasoning

273
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,160
judgment

274
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,690
and decision making

275
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,379
takes place under conditions of on the
certainty

276
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,550
okay

277
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,120
and

278
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,709
weakens archived identified a number of
these conditions which we call

279
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:09,079
conditions of uncertainty first

280
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,130
whenever you have an ill-defined a
problem

281
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,600
whatever you have a problem

282
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,170
that'd mets of more than one
representation

283
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,779
and bus all can be solved in more them
one way okay

284
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:26,309
when you've got to build a fine problem
there is no algorithm that will solve

285
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:28,720
that problem of for you

286
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,150
so that's one way in which we think
about combat conditions of uncertainty

287
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,930
but there are other

288
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,199
conditions about certain people

289
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:41,290
where the problem could in principle be
solved with an algorithm

290
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,769
for one reason or another it just
doesn't work out

291
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:48,439
for example you may not know what the
algorithm is somebody else might know

292
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:50,589
but you don't know what the algorithm is

293
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:55,110
if you don't know what the algorithm is
you're trying to solve the problem under

294
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,430
conditions of uncertainty

295
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,439
or you may know what the algorithm is

296
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,510
but you may have insufficient
information

297
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,450
if three x plus free wine equals twelve

298
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,319
i ask you to solve for x

299
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,790
and you don't know what why is

300
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,220
you can't apply the algorithm anyway
okay

301
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,590
or there may be insufficient opportunity

302
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,200
to take all the information you need and
slogged through the algorithm

303
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,260
to get from

304
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,050
uh... from the initial state

305
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,870
to the goal state insufficient
opportunity either because you don't

306
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,950
have enough time

307
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:36,000
together all the information and to
apply all the transformations

308
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,100
you just don't have enough

309
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,139
to do it

310
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,610
utah it's a

311
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,730
three x plus free wine equals twelve
sulfur exit sec

312
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,070
wine

313
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,550
i don't want out

314
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:54,080
five x's five right because they don't
carry a one a couple lunch or whatever

315
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,009
okay

316
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:57,490
all of these all circumstances

317
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,699
comprise what we call

318
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:01,020
all the conditions of uncertainty

319
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,390
and the point here is dead whenever you
encounter a problem

320
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,460
broadly defined

321
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,420
under conditions of one thirty uses not
going to use an algorithm either 'cause

322
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,129
there isn't an algorithm you don't know
what it is

323
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,089
or you don't for whatever reason

324
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:17,150
you're not be able to

325
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:22,280
to to employ so what do you do one of
those circumstances just stop

326
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,370
without

327
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,819
all we know no

328
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:26,820
that under conditions uncertainty

329
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,330
we shift to another moment all of the
reasoning another mode of problem

330
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,150
solving

331
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,609
all of that has to do

332
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:38,160
with the application of water known as
judgment

333
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,090
heuristics

334
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:45,180
judgment heuristics our approaches to
reasoning and problem solving

335
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,780
that constitute

336
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,320
inferential shortcuts

337
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,980
or judgmental rules are followed

338
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,300
these rules of combat bypassed the
principles of a logical inference okay

339
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,129
and all by bypassing the principles of
logical inference

340
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,150
they permit

341
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,519
plus to make judgments under

342
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:09,240
various conditions of uncertainty

343
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,580
now the interesting thing is

344
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,480
judgment heuristics and able us to make
judgments under conditions of

345
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,190
uncertainty but we tend to use them to
make judgments under conditions of

346
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,819
certainty as well when we make tudjman
civil all kinds

347
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:27,740
we tend to gravitate towards judgment
your respects as opposed

348
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,990
judgment algorithms

349
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,030
usually

350
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:36,130
of reliance on judgment heuristics as
opposed to judgment algorithms

351
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,610
is a good thing

352
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,289
because

353
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,429
you can get a reasonable

354
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:41,740
alaska a

355
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,589
of solution to a problem with relatively
little time involved relatively little

356
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,750
after involved

357
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,370
the problem is

358
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,360
remember what i told you about
algorithms last time

359
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,520
when there's an algorithm available

360
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,600
and over the world currency

361
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,490
that you get the correct solution to a
problem

362
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,039
when you switch to judgment your
respects

363
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,739
that bypass the rules of logical
inference

364
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:08,720
you may never have that guarantee

365
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,990
judgment heuristic may get you to a
solution of problem

366
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,399
or it may lead you

367
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,329
to make

368
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,690
some one or another kind of error

369
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,560

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,320
in further the kinds of judgment
teristics of people use

372
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,850
from an analysis

identified for commonly used a judgment
heuristics

386
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:02,150
four commonly used teristics that are

permits these

388
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,970
it had to go out

389

390
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,540
anyway

391
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,390
four

392
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,980
judgment to respect that are commonly
used in a wide variety of reasoning

393
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,270
domains there are lots of other judgment
to respect so i'm not going to give your

394
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,000
whole catalog from of them but i want
you to appreciate kind of what these two

395
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,170
or teristics are so that you get an idea
of how things go over a congenital

396
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,289
representative s

397
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:32,510
although it to respect that's commonly
used in making judgments of

398
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,600
categorization

399
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,960
also making judgments of probability

400
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,810
capability with respect that's made in
making used commonly in making judgments

401
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,420
of frequency

402
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,779
or simulation

403
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:47,509
ought to respect that's commonly used
for making judgments of probability as

404
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:48,320
well

405
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,610
and anchoring and adjustment or
heuristic that's commonly used an

406
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,350
estimation

407
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,679
let's see how each

408
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,940
of these

409
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,060
first the representative mr rustic

410
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,669
which is used as i said categorization

411
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:02,710
in a sense

412
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,539
you've already seen the representative
mr respect

413
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:08,220
in our discussion of

414
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,520
prototype or probabilistic approaches

415
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,720
to categorization

416
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,340
where there's an algorithm

417
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,539
just compare the features of the object
to the defining features of the target

418
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:18,950
category

419
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,350
and see if there's a match

420
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:26,160
but we don't do that instead we judge
that things are all fruits or articles

421
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,480
of furniture

422
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,350
body

423
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,059
day look-alike and that's essentially

424
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:33,840
on what goes on if the represented in
this

425
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,850
quality respect

426
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,770
here is a good example of it

427
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,940
there's a problem the continent frisky
studied quite a bit

428
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,909
in families of six children

429
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:44,559
which is the most likely sequence

430
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,450
of boys and girls what's the most likely
sequence of boys and girls that joel

431
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:49,870
observed

432
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,720
a girl followed by a boy followed by a
girl following two boys followed by a

433
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,760
girl

434
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,419
three boys and a role

435
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:00,780
followed by three girls in a row

436
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,200
avoid followed by a girl

437
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,770
followed by

438
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,760
boys in a row

439
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,690
in families of six children

440
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,910
which is the most likely sequence of

441
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,870
and girls

442
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,230
most people

443
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,380
that this sequence girl boy girl boy boy
girl

444
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,220
is much more likely

445
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,429
then this sequence three boys followed
by three girls

446
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:25,320
which in turn

447
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,870
is much more likely

448
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,440
then sequence of a boy agrawal followed
by

449
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,770
for boys as well

450
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,370
very common result in a five pulled you

451
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,750
the personnel you know that psychologist
poor these kinds of tricks he wouldn't

452
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,770
answer

453
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,500
all of the right

454
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,190
back when people were naive

455
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:47,289
all of this is the kind of data or that
the gave and of course this is world

456
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:48,030
okay

457
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,839
if you think about it for a second

458
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,220
the probability of any particular
newborn being a boy is one of two

459
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,509
these probabilities are completely
independent of each other

460
00:20:57,509 --> 00:20:58,139
okay

461
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:01,679
so the probability that you were born a
boy or girl didn't have an have anything

462
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,760
to do with the probability but your
order brothers or sisters

463
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,530
were born boys or girls

464
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,200
therefore

465
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,580
the probability of the sequence girl boy
girl boy boy girl

466
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,210
is about

467
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,150
one-and-a-half times out of a hundred

468
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,790
the probability of free voice followed
by three girls is also about one and a

469
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,639
half times out of a hundred

470
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:25,009
and the probability of a boy followed by
a girl followed by four boys

471
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:28,620
is again about one-and-a-half times out
of a hundred

472
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,030
buffering probabilities in question

473
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,520
or precisely equal

474
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,739
if you have six children of family

475
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:38,460
the chance that the sequence is going to
be this

476
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,680
is the same as the chance that the
sequence is going to be that

477
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,159
but it doesn't look without getting okay

478
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,540
we think that the ways and girls appear
more or less randomly in families

479
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,420
and so

480
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,799
when either so we expect the sequence
two-b_-one that looks random

481
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,599
this sequence girl boy girl boy girl

482
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,140
looks more random than this sequence

483
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,210
three boys followed by three girls

484
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,470
and so we judge that this is the more
likely probability when in fact it is

485
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,520
not is a classic illustration

486
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,150
of the home

487
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,360
of the above the use of the
representative maintenance to respect

488
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,750
people are not actually calculated the
probabilities

489
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,769
okay which is something in ohio to do

490
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:28,429
that's an algorithm for solving this
problem just calculate the probabilities

491
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:32,370
one-half raised to the sixth power will
do it every time

492
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:37,470
but instead are picking judgments about
the way things look

493
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,050
about

494
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,840
how closely in event resembles

495
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,910
the image we have

496
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,620
the of the entire category

497
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,630
all this is a the representative
representative nancy respect

498
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,040
all underlies a very common on problem
known as the gambler's fallacy

499
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,400
we know that on a roulette wheel half
the numbers are red and half a numbers

500
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,490
are blacks

501
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,310
if you were asked people which of the
following runs is more likely to end

502
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,450
with a red

503
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,080
red blue red red

504
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,580
red black red red black red black

505
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,020
by blacks in a row

506
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,130
blacks in a row people will generally
say

507
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:23,970
that these two sequences are more likely
to end in a red then this sequence why

508
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,740
this one looks random

509
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,730
profanity this one looks random

510
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,140
and you figure you really can't tell
with the move next one's going to be

511
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,160
black or red

512
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,249
whereas here

513
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:34,450
you think that

514
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:40,350
well in a random sequence it ought to
straighten itself out ok so if you see a

515
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:45,990
local long-run of blacks you figure that
are ready is more likely to come up next

516
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,340
huge numbers of people lose money
gambling

517
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,679
by making judgments like this

518
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,269
it's a fallacy of course because all
there is no

519
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:01,169
a fact on the probability of an event
being black or red

520
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:02,650
depending upon the

521
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,989
of them on the of previous events not of
that's a fair roulette wheel

522
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:10,500
anyway but i fixed roulette wheel that
you're in big trouble

523
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,929
but the fact of the matter is

524
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:15,910
the probabilities or the same in each of
these cases

525
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,310
again

526
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,179
gambler's fallacy occurrence

527
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:24,200
because people make judgments based on
what things look like

528
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,240
whether a sequence looks

529
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,470
random or not

530
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,029
whether it resembles their ideal over
random sequence or not

531
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:34,620
and fail to actually calculate

532
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,299
the probabilities

533
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:42,200
so here we have two examples of these
represented in this your respect

534
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,820
being used in

535
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,909
making judgments although

536
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:49,830
probability so here weakened state the
representative miss your respect

537
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,220
formally

538
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,720
representative is to respect

539
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,669
hoodies used when people

540
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:56,340
faith or judgements on

541
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:01,140
the extent to which an event resembles
that's parent population

542
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,180
whether a string of numbers resembles

543
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,640
the whole population of random numbers
or not

544
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,750
or whether an event

545
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,500
reflex salient features of

546
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,730
generating process

547
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,830
you expect that random generator

548
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,980
would generate roughly half poison
roughly half girls and it did kind of

549
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,169
the all-star

550
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:24,780
intermixed

551
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,999
that's what we think about

552
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:28,010
a sequence of random numbers

553
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:35,010
but cores any sequence of five six ten
random numbers may look very non random

554
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,620
that's the point of the representative
mr respect

555
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,740
where judgments are based on similarity

556
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,369
judgments are based on similar to

557
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:48,399
and there a problem for me it's actually
not a bad idea if i ask you whether an

558
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:50,360
object is a bird

559
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,610
okay

560
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:51,970
and on

561
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,200
a you can measure its body temperature
is check to see if it's got a spinal

562
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,579
cord

563
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:01,959
if it looks like a boost barrel it's
probably a bird right not a bad

564
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:02,510
militaristic

565
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,999
the problem is

566
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:07,600
problems crop up when people fail to
appreciate base rates

567
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,380
when people fail to appreciate

568
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,410
the actual probabilities bombs on you
know involved

569
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,840
that's what the representatives

570
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,840
can we do straight

571
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,950
bombarding seen an example of the
representative mr respect in mister

572
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:28,390
justice graze supreme court decision all
in the art of him in the tariff

573
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,639
activating eighty three

574
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:31,890
where gray basically said

575
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:37,300
tomatoes are vegetables because they
were like vegetables

576
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:42,640
we treat them like vegetables also i'm
going to call it a vegetable even though

577
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,700
botanically speaking

578
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,580
i know that fruits

579
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,870
are all vegetables or betrayals or
fruits

580
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:54,760
what what justice graded was to set
aside the algorithm

581
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,070
but instead

582
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,909
based his judgment on the degree to
which

583
00:26:58,909 --> 00:26:59,679
tomatoes

584
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,830
reptile resembled all other vegetables
seenu

585
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,989
as opposed to

586
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:09,500
uh... resembling other

587
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,420
all here are there's another way in
which you see either represented in this

588
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,330
your respect

589
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,690
all in operations the judgments of
causality

590
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,460
in general people think

591
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,490
that causes and of facts should look
like each other

592
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,500
and in public policy debates

593
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,289
you will often see

594
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:30,380
all people assuming

595
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,540
that causes of a fax will look somehow
like the effects themselves

596
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,630
for example

597
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,959
when people claim

598
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:42,819
that sex education in schools or the
provisional birth control and schools

599
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:44,809
will increase the likelihood

600
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:46,409
of teenage pregnancy

601
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:47,450
file for example

602
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,799
but that's not the case okay we have
very good data on this

603
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:57,190
but people think that alter something
sexual emea fact like teenage pregnancy

604
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,080
or teenage sexual behavior

605
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,810
there ought to be something sexual in
the closet like

606
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,490
sex education putting ideas and kids'
minds or whatever

607
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,190
the our debate about violence on movies
and tv is has some of them to m_t_v_ has

608
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,100
some of the same kinds of qualities

609
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,320
the idea that violence

610
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,620
on media portrayals of violence causes
violent behavior to occur

611
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,600
is very very very popular even though

612
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,340
the evidence on that part of the issue
is highly controversial

613
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,850
yet it's very easy for people to
conclude

614
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,600
that violence in society

615
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,960
is caused by violence in the media

616
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,649
again because they assume

617
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:39,530
that causes are going to resemble on
their effects

618
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,580
all

619
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,460
here's another one a little bit more
subtle

620
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,310
the idea that or it's an organ music
education schools

621
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:50,530
causes students to are to work out what
you prefer

622
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:54,390
works because we have this idea of the
highest cheating stealing as somebody

623
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:59,590
could do calculus and physics and plays
the violin and countries like

624
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,600
shakespeare right

625
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,820
they had this idea of what a
highly-educated of person can do

626
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,679
in fact

627
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,990
although i'm certainly in favor of
artnet norton music education in schools

628
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,740
the evidence that

629
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,750
art music education itself and has this
academic achievement is very very very

630
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,799
controversial

631
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,259
people think it does

632
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,570
because they think that but one kind of
on

633
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,850
of

634
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,309
sophistication

635
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:28,120
will go with another kind of
sophistication

636
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,869
so all we are all in all these examples

637
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:35,320
we have people using the representative
mr respect to make judgments

638
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,280
based on

639
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,910
broke resemblance or based upon
similarity

640
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,850
here's another one

641
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:46,590
the availability to respect also
described by condiment and doug fir uske

642
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,429
very commonly used to make judgments of
frequency

643
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:51,549
and judgments of probability

644
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:56,250
here is a problem that condiments frisky
cept for their subjects

645
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,340
all but i want to do is to estimate the
number of words in english that begin

646
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,160
with the letter k

647
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,770
and estimate the number of words in
english that have k as there

648
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,720
the report

649
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,270
who thinks that the other more of words
in english that begin with caved in her

650
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,549
case or third letter

651
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:17,560
the honest with yourself

652
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,040
who thinks there are no more more called

653
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,260
likely is the third letter

654
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,640
you read ahead

655
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,630
of the fact of the matter is

656
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:31,040
most people who don't think
psychologists are tricky take precisely

657
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,409
the opposite judgment

658
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:35,280
they think that there are vastly more

659
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,350
almost all of the words in english that
begin with the letter k that had to pay

660
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:42,980
if their second or of second or third
letter

661
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,809
when in fact quite the reverse

662
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,180
their many more our words in english

663
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,820
that have to pay as their second or
third letter

664
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,380
that have as their of burst water

665
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,160
all why do people make this mistake

666
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,289
who couldn't think of all the word with
kay is the first letter

667
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:03,610
put up your hand it seems to think of a
word

668
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:10,610
and stone who can't think of a word with
kay is the second letter

669
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,869
that's the dalaberti heuristic ok it's
huge

670
00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:18,840
the to think of words that have k is
their first letter okay

671
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,869
it's not so easy to think about words
that have k is their second or third

672
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:27,930
letter ok there are more of them but
it's harder to think of them

673
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,880
that's the essence of the availability
to respect

674
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,820
when people make judgments based on

675
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,970
the ease with which instances can come
to mind

676
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,230
here's another example study by common
for city

677
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,190
known as the committee problem

678
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,180
given a group of ten people

679
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:48,930
how many different committees of two
people can you create

680
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,759
given a group of ten people

681
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:53,409
how many different committees of eight
people

682
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:55,090
can you

683
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,080
when presented with this

684
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,050
problem most people

685
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,620
drawing

686
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,510
that you can create many more committees
ought to people

687
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,300
then you can of eight people

688
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,020
though if you think about it for a
second

689
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,690
you know that every time you create a
committee of two people one of a group

690
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,710
of ten

691
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,200
you have automatically created a group
of eight people

692
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,350
that's all that's left

693
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,210
there also

694
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:27,150
a committee of eight people so there are
in fact exactly as many

695
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,729
committees of two that you can create
from a group of ten

696
00:32:30,729 --> 00:32:32,759
as there are committees of eight

697
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:36,879
that part that you can create from a
committee of ten it's forty-fourth in

698
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:38,649
both cases a few

699
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:41,240
going to have to apply the bulb
polynomial there from you can just kind

700
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,050
of

701
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,809
think about it for half a second

702
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:47,299
all but that's that that that's the
basic answer

703
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,890
and why do people make this mistake

704
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:54,840
and make this mistake because it's use
the to think about with these either

705
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,970
generate committees

706
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,109
so you think okay you got all call

707
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:03,140
you've got a committee of person any
indian b and c and c indeed

708
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,520
india the indian our friend and after
the indeed

709
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,599
on very easy to generate lots and lots
of committees

710
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,080
but when you try to do the same thing
with eight people use it

711
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,990
alternators person

712
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,639
a b_ c_ d_ e_ f_ g_ age

713
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:24,639
and then there's a person b c d e f g
expired cd that's really are

714
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:25,660
rotate

715
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,860
it's just really hard you can keep a
straight and so you think well gee you

716
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,520
know

717
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,210
he easy enough

718
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,920
i could be a lots of committees of two
so there must be

719
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,090
the ability to respect

720
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:44,859
our current when people make judgments
based on the ease with which

721
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,990
instances can be brought to mind

722
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,820
okay

723
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,269
all and that's not bad idea

724
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:53,710
in the ordinary course of thing

725
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,580
of the ordinary course of things highly
frequent events ought to be easy

726
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,389
to come to mind or to be easy to
retrieve of from memory

727
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:03,710
the problem is

728
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,560
that dot role availability teristics

729
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,160
ignores offer

730
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,860
factors

731
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,599
that can affect

732
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:14,669
home although the availability ok like
just

733
00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:17,650
limitations on human information
processing capacity

734
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,640
one reason

735
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,929
why it's difficult

736
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:25,019
to generate committee of eight from a
group of ten people is that the capacity

737
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:29,649
of short term memory is roughly seven
plus or minus two

738
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:32,330
pretty much exceeds the capacity of
short term memory

739
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:36,240
it's hard to keep the things in mind on
dot com

740
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,219
at a time

741
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:40,599
all about money make our judgment of
availability tweed onsite

742
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,839
all yeah well it's really hard to do
that so i'm going to discount the uh...

743
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:48,280
the fact that it's hard and i'm going to
say well they're probably more

744
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,449
remembers of body we don't do that

745
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:52,509
we ignore these other

746
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:53,909
kinds of uh...

747
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:56,319
these other kinds of factors

748
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:59,089
so that's the availability tourist

749
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:00,529
representative s

750
00:35:00,529 --> 00:35:05,039
faithful where rebate judgments based on
the resemblance or similarity

751
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,480
the availability to restrict where we
make judgments

752
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,890
based on ease with which we can

753
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,989
bring instances to mind

754
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,180
related to the availability to respect

755
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,579
is what's known as the simulation
heuristic

756
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,399
simulation heuristic also being calm

757
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:29,299
uh... used in judgment so probability of
various kinds also being used in

758
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:32,640
judgments of causality of various kinds

759
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,460
here is an illustration

760
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,269
from carmen and frisky

761
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,759
known as the on doing problem

762
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:42,229
what what you imagine two different
travelers heading for the airport

763
00:35:42,229 --> 00:35:45,269
they're scheduled to take different
flights out of the airport

764
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:49,659
that because of the way airline schedule
things the planes are scheduled to leave

765
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:51,439
at the same time

766
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:55,539
these two travelers meet outside the
hotel and they agreed to share a cab to

767
00:35:55,539 --> 00:35:57,129
the airport

768
00:35:57,129 --> 00:35:59,669
the cab gets caught in

769
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:01,279
a traffic jam

770
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:03,449
as tabs often

771
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:06,699
and the cab driver turns on sat i'm
sorry guys i think you're going to miss

772
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:07,959
your plane

773
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:11,050
the two travelers then get to the
airport

774
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,150
thirty minutes late

775
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,289
travel or me okay

776
00:36:16,289 --> 00:36:17,499
gets to his gate

777
00:36:17,499 --> 00:36:22,640
and finds out that his plane left on
time

778
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,739
traveler b

779
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:24,809
gets to his gate

780
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:30,689
and finds out that his flight was
delayed and left five minutes ago

781
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,939
and the question is

782
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,640
who's going to be more upset person pay

783
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,249
are or person

784
00:36:36,249 --> 00:36:39,609
who's going to more upset under those
circumstances

785
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:40,980
the okay

786
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,679
wine

787
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,139
that's in doc exactly the right answer

788
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:48,659
people think these are big vastly more
upset than a wise be good to be more

789
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:53,349
upset

790
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:57,289
just missed it but will cable but what's
the what what's why would i think it was

791
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:02,619
still missed it

792
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:09,619
these yes go ahead

793
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:14,619
okay bob why does that matter

794
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:16,339
okay something like that

795
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:19,669
easy total think of ways in which you
could have caught five minutes off your

796
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:23,160
time if only i haven't brushed your
teeth

797
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,779
if only i hadn't thought stop to call
your husband if only i hadn't thought

798
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,780
stock for that extra cup of coffee or
whatever

799
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,670
i would have gotten in a different have
and i would have gone to the airport and

800
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,759
yes my claim would have been delayed but
at least i would have been on the plane

801
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:40,089
here it is the third simulation
heuristic us

802
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:41,969
you what you have no guarantee

803
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:43,669
that any of that's going to happen

804
00:37:43,669 --> 00:37:47,879
you know for all you know the traffic
jam was worth five minutes before that i

805
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:49,320
was five minutes later

806
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,840
for all you know the plane might have
been delayed off for only twenty minutes

807
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,109
at the post of twenty five minutes or
whatever

808
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:57,019
you simply don't know

809
00:37:57,019 --> 00:37:59,040
you base your judgment

810
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,409
on the ease with which you can

811
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:07,089
various kinds of circumstances okay

812
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:11,849
in the simulation heuristic we base our
judgments on the ease with which we can

813
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:14,679
imagine a plausible cid theo

814
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:18,050
the difference between simulation and
availability

815
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:24,709
is that availability is always based on
use of retrieval from memory

816
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:26,649
it tried to think

817
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:29,859
english words to begin with the letter k
or whatever

818
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:34,160
but in simulation we have the ease with
which you can construct something

819
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,799
the indian national usually

820
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:39,009
or sold out

821
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:43,499
all here do you think about just trying
to concoct plausible scenario was and

822
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:45,250
again the problem here is

823
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,740
that while it may be easy to construct a
plausible scenario that might have led

824
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,740
to a different state of affairs there's
absolutely no guarantee that that

825
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,740
scenario

826
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,739
would have of what would have occurred

827
00:38:57,739 --> 00:38:58,310
use

828
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,519
people use the simulation heuristic all
the time

829
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,480
how many of you have misbehaved in high
school instead to your friend

830
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,669
my parents are gonna kill me

831
00:39:08,669 --> 00:39:09,370
okay

832
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,350
i'm going to be grounded for life or
whatever it is that parents do to kids

833
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,079
these days right

834
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:19,109
that's the simulation heuristic ever
really easy to think about how your

835
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,820
parents are going to react to something

836
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,460
and it's going to be awful of the
world's going to come to an end in

837
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,269
you're going to die

838
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:28,440
these things don't usually happen

839
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,650
that way right

840
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,309
but the stimulation heuristic is easy to
imagine how your parents are going to

841
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:34,340
react

842
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,819
or and they don't necessarily are they
don't necessarily do it

843
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:40,589
all

844
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:45,160
if you think about it for a second
something like the simulation heuristic

845
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,410
all underlies

846
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:49,920
many of our own motion all responses to
events

847
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,469
there's a whole class of a motions known
as the counterfactual emotions

848
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:56,809
frustration

849
00:39:56,809 --> 00:39:58,989
regret

850
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:01,900
and indignation are really good examples

851
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,450
winner

852
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,390
the emotional state

853
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:10,699
is determined in some sense by your
comparison between the actual state of

854
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,259
affairs

855
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:12,809
and

856
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:15,929
what might have been

857
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:19,390
if you think about from frustrations one
thing you know

858
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,859
that's one thing that you'd

859
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:21,839
kind of debt

860
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,490
what you want in life for

861
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,119
within any particular instance

862
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,729
but when something occurs that didn't
have to happen that way

863
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:31,019
that prevents you from

864
00:40:31,019 --> 00:40:34,949
get into a particular fraternity or
getting a particular date on friday

865
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:35,569
night or

866
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:37,690
or getting a particular job or whatever

867
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,239
that's when you really feel frustrated

868
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:45,799
really feel regret about sub is not when
you do something better stupider

869
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:47,049
some negative outcome

870
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:48,539
you regret

871
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:52,239
doing something bad when u could have
done something else but if you can

872
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:54,739
imagine i'll tell you only had said that

873
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:56,399
or whatever

874
00:40:56,399 --> 00:40:58,489
that's the simulation heuristic

875
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,460
and i've been

876
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,359
the ability to army

877
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,339
najib things be different than what they
are

878
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:07,340
imagine how things could be different
from what they are

879
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,289
is what leads us to have

880
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:10,859
these kinds of particular

881
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:13,849
i'll these kinds of particular emotions

882
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:16,739
so represented in this

883
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:17,739
availability

884
00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:20,259
purist on simulation

885
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:24,159
here it is the fourth of condominiums
for cities

886
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:26,680
almost all of that all judgment to
respect

887
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,659
known as the anchoring and adjustment to
respect

888
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:31,920
and this is very commonly used

889
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,380
when we try to make drug for estimates
of various kinds will be tried estimate

890
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,280
the frequency with which

891
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,979
all of them super

892
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:46,609
here is a problem that condiments risky
used to of to a study angry adjustment

893
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:50,930
called the extrapolation problem u_s_
people very quickly to estimate

894
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:54,150
the result of the following
multiplication pick one group of

895
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,419
subjects who say

896
00:41:55,419 --> 00:41:57,680
what's so what's the uh... producto

897
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,329
a time seven times six times five times
four times three times two times one

898
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:05,819
you get an estimate adult google
multiplication

899
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:07,279
do the estimate

900
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:08,770
bigger deliverables subject

901
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:12,580
and you say what's the product of one
times two times three times four to five

902
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,879
point six and seven times a day

903
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:17,890
when you do that

904
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:22,710
befallen results when you get people
behave sending version of the problem

905
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:26,290
one times two times three times four
times five times six times seven times

906
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:26,890
eight

907
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,679
their estimation is much lower

908
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:32,990
then when you give them descending
version of the problem

909
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:36,609
eight times seven times six times five
times four times three times two times

910
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:39,249
what even though of course

911
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:42,719
the two problems are exactly alike
they're exactly identical the products

912
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:44,469
are exactly identical

913
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:46,239
how does this happen

914
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:48,950
it turns out

915
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:52,849
try to estimate this you start out one
times two times three times for you

916
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:56,480
could try to do it at your head one
comes to his two times three and six

917
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,910
times for its twenty four e keep all
that kind of straight in your head

918
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:03,200
but when you try to do with the other
way

919
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,949
eight time six is fifty four times seven
is that i can even do that in my head

920
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:08,940
okay

921
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,940
or i could do it on my head but i don't
want to do in my head and it's getting

922
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,839
really vague

923
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,999
so what happens here is that people are
making their estimates based on what you

924
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:26,519
might call early data returns one times
two times three that's a relatively low

925
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:30,930
number so you think the final product is
going to be relatively low eight times

926
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:35,900
six times seven a daytime seven-time sex
is a relatively big number so you think

927
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,629
that the final product is going to be
are relatively big

928
00:43:39,629 --> 00:43:41,960
and corinne an adjustment

929
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,269
indoochawla estimates

930
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:49,649
anchor final estimates they hold them
down they hold on where they are if the

931
00:43:49,649 --> 00:43:53,850
initial estimate is bad than we think
the final is going to be big

932
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:58,230
if the initial estimate a small then we
get we think the final i was going to be

933
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,869
small is called anchoring an adjustment

934
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:05,949
nishal jostle additional estimates
anchor a final estimates

935
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:11,229
and in making final estimates we engage
in insufficient adjustment

936
00:44:11,229 --> 00:44:12,479
from and nishal

937
00:44:12,479 --> 00:44:15,179
our customers here is

938
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:16,699
another example of this

939
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:19,910
called the united nations problem
comment first be studied this one as

940
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:20,799
well

941
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:22,889
they went off the people on the street

942
00:44:22,889 --> 00:44:23,530
on said

943
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:27,599
i like 'em doing a survey i'd like you
to estimate the percentage of countries

944
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,710
in the united nations that come from the
continent of africa

945
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,319
went to one group of people inside some
people say it's ten percent what do you

946
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:37,249
think

947
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:39,080
toward other triple subjects is that

948
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:45,339
some people say at sixty five percent
what do you think

949
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:48,239
peoples as the mets

950
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,079
depended upon the information they were
provided about what other people say ok

951
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:58,759
when people we're told that some people
say it's ten percent they gave all lower

952
00:44:58,759 --> 00:45:00,630
estimate then when they were told

953
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,229
that some people say its

954
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:04,119
five percent

955
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:05,509
so here

956
00:45:05,509 --> 00:45:07,039
nishal estimate

957
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:08,129
anchors

958
00:45:08,129 --> 00:45:09,470
the final estimate

959
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:14,500
there's insufficient adjustment from the
additional estimate now you can say what

960
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,799
cool down the road told me in some
people say it's ten percent

961
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:19,929
antonio hole was

962
00:45:19,929 --> 00:45:23,269
for all you've got a complete idiot

963
00:45:23,269 --> 00:45:27,129
at intel representative sample of the
population says it's ten percent or

964
00:45:27,129 --> 00:45:32,400
anything like that has had some people
for all your does your brother

965
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,079
this works out this way even

966
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:39,469
when the august even when the initial
estimate is given by this bit of a

967
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:42,650
roulette wheel they actually did this
experiment

968
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,319
where they say they are

969
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,149
sump all of the budget tell me at all
what percentage of the united nations

970
00:45:48,149 --> 00:45:51,179
members come from a comment about her
weight perceptible in spindle roulette

971
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:52,569
wheel

972
00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:56,919
and a roulette wheel would come up five
or six for forbes objects and

973
00:45:56,919 --> 00:46:00,739
thirty four and thirty eight of the
birth of thirty six for other subjects

974
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:03,969
the people of dot the five and six would
give a lower estimate that the people

975
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:08,519
who got the thirty four and thirty five
even though at some roulette wheel for

976
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,209
god's sake

977
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:14,089
the than this show as timid encouraged
the final estimate

978
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:17,470
so and that's what the anchorage
adjustment is all about

979
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:21,949
final estimates are overwhelmingly
influenced by initial estimates okay

980
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:25,749
uh... where the initial values serves as
well as as an anchor

981
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:29,859
and of course that's not a bad idea and
put the kerrigan estimate something that

982
00:46:29,859 --> 00:46:33,239
the big your initial estimate is
probably going to be big too

983
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,419
if you're going to have straight
something small your initial estimates

984
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,450
profile public under the small as well

985
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:41,789
but there are problems it's not an
algorithm

986
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:43,770
it's not guaranteed to give you

987
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,230
be correct answer

988
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:48,740
because there could be problems in the
formulation of the problem some people

989
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,890
say it's ten percent what do you say

990
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,039
that's no way to ask people this

991
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:58,769
all or the partial computation might be
misleading one times two times three

992
00:46:58,769 --> 00:47:04,719
times four vs eight ten seven times six
times five ok in any event theories

993
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:07,249
insufficient adjustment from the a

994
00:47:07,249 --> 00:47:10,269
from the foam from the uh... initial
value

995
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:12,349
so there we go

996
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:15,629
represented s

997
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:17,269
availability

998
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:18,470
simulation

999
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:23,379
anchoring an adjustment or an agreement
insufficient adjustment if you will

1000
00:47:23,379 --> 00:47:29,430
four ways in which across a wide variety
wide range of problems

1001
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,889
wider range of decision context

1002
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:34,709
people depart from

1003
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:37,950
uh... normative rules of logical
inference

1004
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:40,700
people you can use these judgement she
respects

1005
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,929
widely in everyday life

1006
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:45,429
either because

1007
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:48,759
un alberta isn't available to them there
is no longer rhythm

1008
00:47:48,759 --> 00:47:51,839
or because they're insufficiently
motivated or they don't have enough

1009
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,229
information to use this over them

1010
00:47:54,229 --> 00:47:57,709
but kinds of problems that we had
counter

1011
00:47:57,709 --> 00:48:00,370
the ordinary course of everyday living

1012
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,729
or technically

1013
00:48:01,729 --> 00:48:04,049
ill defined problems

1014
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,799
there's either not an algorithm

1015
00:48:06,799 --> 00:48:10,869
there's an algorithm that for one reason
other the we don't know about or we can

1016
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:14,219
use or under those circumstances

1017
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:15,379
rely

1018
00:48:15,379 --> 00:48:22,229
instead on judgment teristics like the
ones the condom and for ski define

1019
00:48:22,229 --> 00:48:25,069
okay will finish this up next time thank
you very much
