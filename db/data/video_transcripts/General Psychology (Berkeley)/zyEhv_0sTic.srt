1
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:12,619
okay

2
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:15,369
last time we began to discuss

3
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:17,320
the

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,769
problems with the traditional stimulus
response or s our theory of learning

5
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,560
one of which comes from

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,949
a classic study of taste aversion by
garcia and his colleagues

7
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:34,450
errant gallery called the white garcia's
colleagues did

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,620
was to take a compound conditioned
stimulus

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,110
bright noisy sweetwater

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,989
and parent

11
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:47,699
either with a food chocolate bird while
the animal was drinking which elicits

12
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:48,840
immediate

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,160
unpleasantness

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,719
or with x radiation

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,860
delivered while the animal was drinking

16
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,490
which

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,600
all of you a sense

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,300
delayed

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,080
on pleasant news

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,290
and that what garcia did was to

21
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,509
test

22
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:08,890
the animals

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,959
fear in the presence of the water

24
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,990
by giving them to different sources of
water to drink from to choose from

25
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,620
either bright noisy water water
accompanied by the light minorities

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,869
or sweetwater water flavored with
saccharine

27
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:25,869
and as i showed you last time

28
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:29,310
the animals that were shocked

29
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,299
preferred the sweetwater

30
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,520
intended to avoid the bright noisy water

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,380
whereas the animals that were

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,400
irradiated

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,060
tended to prefer the bright noisy water

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,190
and to avoid the sweetwater

35
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,279
what we have here at this and citizens

36
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,160
interesting

37
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,660
instance

38
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,140
of the violation of the arbitrariness
assumption

39
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,049
because

40
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,770
all three all of these

41
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,420
balance

42
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,799
have been

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,549
parent equally well with the un
conditions stimuli

44
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,520
yet it turns out

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,200
it's easier for an animal to learn about
the association between light and noise

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,329
and shock

47
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:17,539
that it is to learn about the
association between

48
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:17,950
paste

49
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,979
and shock

50
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,419
and it's easier for the animal

51
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:23,040
to learn the association between taste

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,339
and nausea

53
00:02:24,339 --> 00:02:27,460
that it is worth a learned the
association between light

54
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,400
and always

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,689
and nausea

56
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:31,319
now last time i argued

57
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,109
that this experiment

58
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:34,219
violates

59
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:37,679
the result of these experienced by first
and foremost

60
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,720
violates the arbitrariness assumption

61
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,920
of the stimulus response learning theory
because the arbitrariness assumption

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,250
says

63
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,249
you can take any condition stimulus

64
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:51,199
and paragraph anytime conditions
stimulus and get conditioning it turns

65
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,939
out not to be the case

66
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,310
it's much easier

67
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,659
to condition

68
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,449
fear of shock

69
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,799
or avoidance of shock

70
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:02,170
to light and sound that it is to taste

71
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,420
it's much easier

72
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,610
the condition

73
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,969
all version two x radiation

74
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,209
for nausea

75
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:09,239
to taste

76
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,689
than the light and sound

77
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,889
apparently rats are built

78
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,319
by evolution

79
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,069
to associate taste

80
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,620
with the gastrointestinal consequences
of what

81
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,219
ingest

82
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:24,680
and they were built by virtue of
evolution

83
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,009
to associate

84
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,269
the alone

85
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,069
our sights and sounds in their
environment

86
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,739
so not only though do these results
violate the arbitrariness assumption

87
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,170
they also violate the assumption of the
empty organism

88
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,290
because they tell us that we have to
know something about the organisms

89
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,369
evolutionary history power it is built
as a biological

90
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:48,920
creature

91
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,889
to understand wanted can learn and what
it at work

92
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,509
and then i think i said in passing last
time

93
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:59,990
this is an experiment also violated

94
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,719
the assumption of association by
conjugate woody

95
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,379
and the reason for that is the elements
on the compound condition stimulus are

96
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,039
all equally contiguous

97
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,539
for charter

98
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:18,600
and they're all equally contiguous

99
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,070
the x-ray

100
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,219
okay

101
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,240
yet

102
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,650
some of these stimuli

103
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,389
get associated with these on cat what
some of these conditions there like a

104
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:28,970
dissociated

105
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,019
with these different on conditions there
like and others don't

106
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:32,720
moreover

107
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,440
if you think about it for a second

108
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,330
the arable may feel before chalk
certainly does deal with which are

109
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,559
condones of like it

110
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:45,680
but the adult docent feel the x-rays
when they were being

111
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,249
deliver okay you don't feel those things

112
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:52,009
but what the animal does feel is the
nausea

113
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,119
that occurs much later

114
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,199
so if we have a condition

115
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,259
in which

116
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:00,810
and but the commission stimulus the
taste of the water

117
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,310
ken get paired off with nausea

118
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,629
even though there's a big delaying

119
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:07,830
between the taste

120
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,979
and the dawn steel

121
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:10,310
so this violates

122
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,069
the assumption of association by kon
tiki audios well

123
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:15,180
by showing

124
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,349
that an association to be forum

125
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:21,639
between events that are widely separated
in time

126
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:24,650
what i want to do today is to pick up

127
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,629
on

128
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:29,349
problem of association by kon tiki
already

129
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:30,680
and demonstrate

130
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,659
in some other ways that it is not the
right principle

131
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,089
of association

132
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:41,650
here for example is what's known as the
standard paradigm for classical

133
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,689
conditioning

134
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:46,960
this is a schematic diagram of a century
what pavlov did

135
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,560
and for that matter what everybody else
does

136
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,039
huang

137
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,860
held with who studies boat

138
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,949
classical conditioning

139
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:59,189
we have conditioned stimulus the battle

140
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:00,449
is presented

141
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,749
at roughly the same time as the food

142
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:03,900
dole food

143
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,280
bell food bell food and by virtue of the
repeated paryant

144
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,020
of the bell and the food

145
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,259
the adl comes to celebrate to the battle

146
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,389
in the same way as it celebrates

147
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,379
to the photo

148
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,460
i remember the standard exploration of
this is

149
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,460
that because the ballad of food are
presented

150
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,689
close together in time

151
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:27,790
that's what association by conjugate
woody means

152
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,289
close together in time that an
association is formed between them

153
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,979
all well and go ahead

154
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,129
except that

155
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:40,870
here it is another paradigm in classical
conditioning

156
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,189
known as delay conditioning

157
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:44,030
and here

158
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,699
the onset of the condition stimulus

159
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,789
occurs

160
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:49,520
and then some

161
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,979
time later

162
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:54,830
the odds that all of the un conditions
stimulus occurs

163
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,909
and the fact is

164
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:58,900
that even though the onset of the
convention stimulus

165
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,160
and the onset of young condition
stimulus are now separated by an

166
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,970
appreciable da way

167
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,719
you still get good conditioning you
still get the animal

168
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,759
responding to bell

169
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,419
all it the way it had responded to the
following

170
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,360
they could say well alright

171
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,990
the onset of the condition stimulus

172
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,590
is delay the onset of young condition
stimulus is delayed

173
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,499
with respect to the onset of the
conditions that those

174
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:27,469
but there's still this period of time

175
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:28,979
when they're together

176
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,370
where the animal is getting food

177
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,619
and the bell is still on

178
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,319
all right

179
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,330
leads us to

180
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,900
on a third

181
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,930
paradigm in classical conditioning

182
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,999
known as trace conditioning

183
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,409
where the bell comes on

184
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,210
and then it goes off

185
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,630
and sometime later the food

186
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,650
comes on

187
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,500
and then later the food goes off

188
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,720
there is a delay between the offset

189
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,289
of the condition stimulus

190
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:00,089
and the onset of the on conditions
stimulus

191
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:03,449
there are no longer presented together
at any point

192
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,949
in the procedure

193
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,819
but you still

194
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,680
fairer amount all

195
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,689
classical

196
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,199
conditioning

197
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,309
you still get the animals celebrating
for the bell

198
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:14,619
as it's elevated

199
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,319
to for food

200
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,800
and to kind of

201
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,849
nail down the point

202
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:24,349
here is a fourth variant on the
classical conditioning

203
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:25,110
paradigm

204
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,410
known as simultaneous conditioning

205
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,509
where

206
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,830
notice that the audience that of the
conditions stimulus

207
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,710
occurs at exactly the same time as the
onset of the on condition stimulus

208
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:41,180
and the offset of the conditions
stimulus occurs at exactly the same time

209
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,030
as the offset of the unconditional
stimulus

210
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,340
as this

211
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,340
line indicates

212
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,550
no condition occurs

213
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,970
how could that be

214
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,560
if conditioning if forming an
association

215
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,790
was a matter of associating temporally
contiguous events you ought to get very

216
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,819
nice association between

217
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:05,800
the conditioned stimulus and the on
conditions there was

218
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,080
because the tuesday lawyer or a career

219
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,890
at precisely the same time

220
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,790
you can get more contiguous than that

221
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,270
there's no conditioning that occurrence

222
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,740
and if

223
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,919
for their demonstration needed

224
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,579
here's a paradigm known as backwards
conditioning another variant on

225
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:29,970
classical conditioning

226
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,590
where the odd condition stimulus comes
on the food is presented

227
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,210
before

228
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,660
the condition stimulus comes on so it's
food bell

229
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,280
food bell food bell

230
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,140
and even though there's some overlap

231
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,120
and even though the onset of the food in
the onset of the bellacor pretty close

232
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,170
together

233
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,440
enough in time still noel conditioning
occurs

234
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,839
notice that in backwards conditioning

235
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,950
the temporal arrangements are exactly
the same

236
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,640
except that they've been reversed

237
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,240
shortly followed by dole

238
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,420
whereas in the standard paradigm

239
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,190
it's bell shortly buffaloed by food

240
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:19,710
when the bell as follow by food you get
conditioning

241
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,510
when the food is followed by the bell
you know

242
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,740
conditioning

243
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,250
even though

244
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,310
temporal relations

245
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,709
or otherwise exactly the same betu

246
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:31,850
ulm of events

247
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,339
are occurring

248
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:35,720
close together in space and time

249
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,000
let me say one more thing about
backwards conditioning in fact what you

250
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,380
get in

251
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,340
backwards commissioning

252
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,500
is not just be the lack

253
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,270
of a conditioned response

254
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:51,460
you will actually get the in addition
other conditioned response or a police

255
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,510
oppression of air conditioned response

256
00:10:53,510 --> 00:11:00,180
we see this very clearly enough paradigm
known as fair conditioning where tone

257
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,510
paired with shock

258
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,850
the tones so yes

259
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,169
is followed by the shock

260
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:06,480
u_s_ okay

261
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
and what happens

262
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,629
when you do this

263
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:10,029
is that you get

264
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,899
they could that one of the physiological
responses to beyond commission stimulus

265
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:15,890
shock

266
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,510
heart rate the celebration the alleles
were frayed

267
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,639
and when you're afraid

268
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,810
your heart rate or speeds off

269
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,650
that's a physiological index of fear and
what happens is after repeated parents

270
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,639
of the tone and the shock

271
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,499
you've got

272
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:32,249
heart rate a celebration to the tone

273
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:35,299
as well as to the shock that's air
conditioned

274
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:36,590
for your response

275
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,250
now that's true if u

276
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,790
golf ball use the standard paradigm

277
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,800
where the toll follows shock

278
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,310
you'll get the heart rate deceleration
of the tone

279
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,890
what's known as a condition for your
response

280
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,730
but if u

281
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,170
the arrangements

282
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,390
the reverse

283
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,530
where shock comes on and then the tone
comes on

284
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,850
you don't get heart rate the celebration
during the tone

285
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,459
in fact you get its opposite

286
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,830
you get heart rate deceleration

287
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,759
for the tone

288
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,170
okay the suppression of a condition for
your response

289
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,610
why would that be

290
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:18,260
one hello hello

291
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,390
that's right exactly what's happening

292
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,540
off the hours in the starter paradigm
the tone communicates to the animal yet

293
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,450
i got shocked

294
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,280
okay

295
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,670
in the backward paradigm the tone
communicates to be out of all that you

296
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,330
not being shocked anymore you're not
going to get shocked for a while

297
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,860
it's consul most like the safety signal

298
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,240
so here in backwards conditioning

299
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,080
you will get the

300
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,150
in addition or the suppression all volvo
video of a normal

301
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,139
of course the condition

302
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:49,230
condition response

303
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,570
what these

304
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,450
points illustrate is that associations
are not toward according to a principle

305
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,580
of

306
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,350
contingent of of what kinda get woody

307
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,760
instead

308
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,700
associations are formed

309
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,050
by principal all contingency

310
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,870
bike i think you honey we mean but the
condition stimulus and the young

311
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,940
conditioned stimulus occur together in
space and time

312
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,690
co-occurring space and time

313
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,120
by contingency we mean

314
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
that the conditions they millis

315
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,230
pretexts

316
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,650
be on condition stimulus

317
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,740
then the standard paradigm for classical
conditioning

318
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,390
where the c_s_ and the u_s_ occur close
together with the c_s_ preceding the

319
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,170
u_s_ by your short interval

320
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,679
but couldnt believe was seen as the u_s_
are both contentioned and contiguous

321
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,630
they occur close together in space and
time

322
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,079
bop more important

323
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,979
the condition stimulus

324
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:42,330
pretext

325
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,720
the onset albion conditioned stimulus

326
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,310
and delay conditioning

327
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,899
and then trace conditioning

328
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,710
we degraded

329
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,150
but continuity

330
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,939
between the c_b_s_ in the u_s_

331
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:57,800
they're no longer appearing so close
together in space and time

332
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,150
but it's still the case

333
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:04,070
that the c_s_ predicts the u_s_ so it's
the c_s_ comes on first

334
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,190
and then the u_s_

335
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,740
comes on later

336
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,019
where the c_ as in the u_s_ are
contingent but not contiguous

337
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,460
you still get

338
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,920
okay conditioning

339
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,400
notice what happens in the simultaneous
case

340
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,139
the c_s_ in the u_s_ they're contiguous
with each other

341
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:24,040
therapy reno's close together in space
and time is anytime stimuli possibly

342
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,030
could

343
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,080
but the contingency has now been
degraded

344
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,310
when the bell comes on at the same time
as the food

345
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,750
or the tone comes on at the same time as
the shock

346
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,990
this the c_s_ ism predicting anything
anymore

347
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,870
on and

348
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,689
in backwards conditioning

349
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:46,559
where the u_s_ comes on and then later
the c_s_ comes on

350
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,430
what the c_s_ is actually predict
because the absence

351
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,320
of the on conditions there

352
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,350
so we get conditioning

353
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,460
so long as

354
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,610
yes and the u_s_ are in a contingent
relationship

355
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,550
regardless of the continuity

356
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,709
even though

357
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,230
on that as well as long as the c_e_o_'s
predicts

358
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,839
the u_s_ you're going

359
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,850
to get or they're going to get

360
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,460
conditioning

361
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,590
so what we're looking at here now

362
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,500
the importance of the information

363
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,449
that's provided by the condition
stimulus

364
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:22,660
to the adult

365
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,210
when the upon conditioned stimulus is
contingent on the condition stimulus

366
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,950
then the conditions they're most is
providing information to be out of all

367
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,970
about what's going to happen next when
the bell comes on

368
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,420
the bell tells the animal your gonna get
fed

369
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,979
when the tone comes on

370
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,640
but only tells the animal you're gonna
get shocked

371
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,980
but in the final taneous case

372
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,870
what the tone tells the animal is

373
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,240
european shocked

374
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,840
any other will already knows that

375
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,560
okay

376
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,170
doesn't mean that information is got no
use

377
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:01,710
offer that information so condition
occurs because

378
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,510
and all the f

379
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,490
the condition stimulus provides
information about the u_n_ conditions

380
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,260
stimulus

381
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,179
where

382
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:12,339
beyonce condition stimulus is not
informative about the on conditions

383
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,470
there goes

384
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:19,160
condition stimulus or the conditioning
simply isn't going to

385
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,760
let's take a break for a second any
questions about these various paradox of

386
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,140
what the report rations are

387
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,740
association by contribution

388
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,650
appears not to be the principle of
association

389
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,460
association by cob by contingency

390
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,530
the principal it's not whether the c_s_
in the u_s_ occur close together in

391
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,839
space and time

392
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:40,050
that's important

393
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,269
what's important is at the c_e_o_s

394
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:48,230
predicts the u_s_ yes

395
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,080
sure

396
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,800
in delay conditioning where i my

397
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,320
in delay conditioning

398
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,889
the asset

399
00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:01,150
all of the on conditions stimulus is
delayed by some interval

400
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,720
notice that this

401
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,160
interval between onset of csn onset of
u_s_

402
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,730
is longer

403
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,530
then in

404
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,079
the standard case

405
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,310
so there's our domain

406
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,480
between the onset of the one in the
onset of the other okay

407
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,600
notice that there's still some overlap

408
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,410
the condition stimulus is still on when
the food comes on

409
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,230
trace

410
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,730
conditioning

411
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,410
the convention stimulus is gone

412
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,089
before the food comes on

413
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:35,830
it's called trace conditioning because
it's as if you have to have a trace of

414
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,830
the c_b_s_ and memory

415
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,730
for conditioning

416
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,530
to occur

417
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,370
that interval between the offset of the
c_ yes

418
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,669
and beyond said

419
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:49,380
of the u_s_ that makes a difference
between delay conditioning

420
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,299
treats condition

421
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:59,299
anything else about this

422
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,740
well what

423
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,390
what rates conditioning n delay
conditioning both do

424
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,740
is to degrade the conjugate our country
guilty

425
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,750
the interval

426
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,399
the time interval between the onset of
the c_b_s_ in the onset of the u_s_

427
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,179
is now

428
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,110
longer

429
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,600
then it is

430
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,780
the standard case

431
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,070
but in all three of these cases

432
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,749
the onset of the c_s_ still

433
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:33,280
is a perfect predictor

434
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,380
the u_s_

435
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,700
and that's what's important

436
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,960
arnaud if there is that's because of a
slip of my head there isn't more

437
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,830
response these are supposed to be
identical

438
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,200
there's not there's only more response

439
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,710
there's only more response because bugs
c_s_ is on longer

440
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,040
from apple is

441
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,970
if you look at it just in terms of
probability response it's the same

442
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:10,940
one more question

443
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,160
no in the in the yard in the center
pairing the c_s_ in the u_s_ are both

444
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,220
contiguous and contingent

445
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,220
they occur close together in time

446
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,990
and the c_s_ predicts the u_s_

447
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,070
them

448
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,440
delay conditioning

449
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,170
continuity is degraded

450
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,830
they no longer kirk so close together in
space and time

451
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:35,930
but the c_s_ is still a predictor of the
u_s_

452
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,300
traits conditioning

453
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,170
they also

454
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,250
not so contiguous any longer

455
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,360
they don't occur so close together in
space and time

456
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,960
but the csce still critics

457
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,750
the u_s_

458
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,080
in simultaneously conditioning

459
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,299
they're perfectly contiguous

460
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:57,289
beyond sets of the offsets are exactly
at the same time but the c_s_ no longer

461
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:58,720
predicts the u_s_

462
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,400
no condition occurs

463
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,030
and then finally in backwards
conditioning

464
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,650
the interval between unscented ross that
is supposed to be the same here as in

465
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,760
the standard case just that it's
backwards now

466
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,789
so there are as

467
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:15,690
in some sense there is contiguous is
they are in the standard case but the

468
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,809
c_e_o_'s no longer predicts the u_s_

469
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,410
what the c_s_ predicts is the offset

470
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,919
of the u_s_

471
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,310
now let's add a very and on this just to
try to make it even clearer

472
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:31,580
let's look at another famous experiment
in the are conditioned literature

473
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,160
by leon came in

474
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,679
on what's known as the blocking affect

475
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,429
in the caymans experiment

476
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:42,970
he used a compound stimulus

477
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,410
noise and light

478
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,890
the onset of the noise the onset of a
white exactly the same time

479
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,420
onset all seven always also polite
exactly at the same time

480
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,710
and then

481
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,039
this compound condition stimulus

482
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,460
is paired

483
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,160
the on condition stimulus

484
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,890
what happens here of course is the
animals going out of a choir a condition

485
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,480
for your response the animals going to

486
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,509
acquire

487
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:09,600
air-conditioned response

488
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,020
this compound stimulus but what came in
did

489
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:19,770
waters to decide to test the elements of
the compounds of condition stimulus

490
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,400
separately

491
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,820
so what he did here

492
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,520
was to condition the animal

493
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,900
to be afraid

494
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,169
in the presence of

495
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:30,770
the compound stimulus noise white and
then just test the animals response to

496
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,140
the white alone

497
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,740
and what came and discovered

498
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,350
was a big apple gives

499
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,500
solid for your response

500
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,700
the elements that's true for the noise
or as well

501
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,280
even though the animals been conditioned

502
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,720
a compound conditioned stimulus

503
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,059
it shows a condition fear response

504
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,000
to each

505
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,650
of the elements

506
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,880
but now what came in did was something
all little tricky

507
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,020
you break this up a little bit

508
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,159
in the first phase of the experiment

509
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,010
he conditions the animal to nahis

510
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:05,900
terrible shock

511
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,110
noida shock

512
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,059
noise shock nor a shock for several
trials

513
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,210
then what came in did

514
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,930
was to introduce

515
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,050
the light

516
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,640
as a compound condition stimulus

517
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,549
so now what

518
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,390
noise of light

519
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,290
noise a light

520
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,240
noise and light

521
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,200
and then what came in did

522
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,690
was to test the animals

523
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:35,480
respond condition for your response to a
white and he thought that there was no

524
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,640
condition for your response

525
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,270
to the light

526
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,630
contrast

527
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,690
the absence

528
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,910
the condition

529
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,180
for your response

530
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,900
when the animal's first condition to the
noise

531
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,110
and then to the noise unlike compound

532
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,380
the animal doesn't respond

533
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,620
the after the light

534
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,390
compared to

535
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:58,000
the first uxbridge of experiment where
the animals condition to light employees

536
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,820
right from the get go

537
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,930
and then

538
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,460
shows a strong condition

539
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,700
response

540
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,140
what seems to be happening here this is
not depiction of kuala caymans actual

541
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,050
results

542
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,090
where animals are condition to the noise
alone

543
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,310
and then get test responsible light

544
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,300
if their condition of the noise alone

545
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,630
they don't show when he peered of alike

546
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,570
if they are conditioned on the compound
alone

547
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,630
they show after your response

548
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,580
from all white

549
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,260
but if they are conditioned first of the
noise

550
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,060
and then to the compound

551
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,169
they show no more fear of the light

552
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:36,950
then if they had never been exposed

553
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,540
for the white at all

554
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,059
this is known as da blocking affect

555
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,460
conditioning an animal

556
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,330
all

557
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,890
but no worries

558
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,630
blocks the acquisition

559
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,570
of conditions for your

560
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,720
the compound

561
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,289
and what that tells us

562
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:57,070
is that

563
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,650
there's something very important going
on

564
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:04,920
it's not just association by contingency
that's important here but that

565
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,870
conditioning apparently

566
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,580
only kerns

567
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,730
when the on conditions stimulus

568
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,290
surprises

569
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,220
the organism

570
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,899
conditioning only occurs

571
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:20,690
when the unconditional stimulus
surprises the organism

572
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,650
when the organism a surprised by
something new that's happening tomorrow

573
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,050
hey i'm getting shocked naal

574
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,380
what the adult dogs

575
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,700
is to search

576
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,989
the environment

577
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:35,600
for a projector of this event

578
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,500
so i play on getting shot down and try
to farah when this can happen silicon

579
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,780
grit my little rat teeth or whatever it
is that the animals going to do

580
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,230
and then what happens

581
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,610
is that when the animal fines

582
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,169
predictor all of the unconditional
stimulus

583
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,470
it focuses its attention on that

584
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,850
and ignores

585
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:59,600
or other events that are irrelevant

586
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,809
and id nor is all other events

587
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:05,870
that or on that are redone did with what
it already knows

588
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,289
so to go back here for a minute

589
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:12,320
noises parable shock

590
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,419
shock is the surprising event noise it
is a really wild predictor of that event

591
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:19,399
the animal figures that out

592
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:21,250
during phase one

593
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,809
in phase two noise and light

594
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:25,750
are paired together with shock

595
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,230
but the others already got a perfectly
good predictor of the shock

596
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,350
he knows when the noise comes on is
going to get shot

597
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,359
so he ignores the animal ignores

598
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:36,930
polite

599
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,499
so that when you test the animals
response to the white alone

600
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:42,470
it has an acquired andy

601
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,990
kind of fear

602
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,309
conditioning occurrence

603
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:47,980
when the on condition stimulus

604
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,790
surprises the organism

605
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,210
conditioning a curve

606
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,860
when there is an event in the

607
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,360
environment

608
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,309
that can serve as a reliable predictor

609
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:03,250
when an animal has a reliable predictor
of this

610
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,730
previously surprising event

611
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,620
it focuses on it egmore is everything
else

612
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,130
no matter how many times

613
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,560
polite is paired with the shock in this
circumstance the animal will show any

614
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,880
fear

615
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,059
whose will never acquiring a cure for
that shock

616
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,740
fifth i don't know about this

617
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,059
on or you know about this

618
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:27,570
by virtue

619
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,569
so that just goes to show

620
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:32,200
that what's happening here

621
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,850
coren classical conditioning

622
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:39,710
it's not just that environmental events
like water the power to a bloke reflexes

623
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,900
which is what i said at the end of last
wednesday's lecture okay

624
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,870
that's not just what's going on here

625
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,280
and classical conditioning what was
happening is at the organism is

626
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,700
developing expectations

627
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,260
about what's going to happen in its
environment

628
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,320
it's dot you'd it's developing the
ability to predict

629
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,350
by virtue

630
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,530
on condition stimuli

631
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,840
what's going to happen

632
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,760
with respect

633
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,190
to on conditions stimulant it develops
the expectations

634
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,099
the on condition stimulus

635
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:13,289
is going to predict the on

636
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:16,450
on the on conditions there

637
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,230
awkward questions on the blocking
experiment

638
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,330
the point is

639
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,280
no condition occurs

640
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,179
when the c_s_ is redundant

641
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:27,330
with unknown c_s_ and that's exactly

642
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,850
what we have here

643
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,300
by virtue of phase one

644
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,430
we've already got unknown c_s_

645
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,250
the new c_s_ is just redundant with the
first one

646
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:41,510
no conditioning

647
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,890
now that's for classical conditioning

648
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,250
let's look at the same kind of thing

649
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,730
in the instrumental case

650
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:52,320
here we have a phenomenon known as
learned helplessness

651
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,309
study by

652
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:57,279
martin seligman steve mayor and richard
solomon at the same solomon i told you

653
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,440
about

654
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,430
before

655
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:04,120
what they're doing web what what this
experiment involves

656
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,909
variant on the avoidance learning
paradigm

657
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:08,990
that i told you about before

658
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,850
where you have dogs and a shuttle box
anatole incomes on

659
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,799
and later shock is going to come on

660
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,940
and the animal can escape

661
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,520
and avoid the shock by moving from one
side of the shuttle box to another

662
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,289
and what i told you last time

663
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:26,700
was that animals dogs learn this

664
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,200
perfectly well they were in this very
very very easily

665
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,620
although and alright not outlined for
you

666
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,669
ma worries

667
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:37,390
to process

668
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,100
theory of avoidance learning

669
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,929
by which

670
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,730
for morrow argued that

671
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,199
first half of the thing that happens and
avoid the story

672
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:50,820
is that the animal acquires of
conditioned fear to the tone

673
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,299
and then the animal acquires an
instrumental response

674
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,100
that gets rid of the shock and turns
love the tone

675
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,159
if that's the case okay

676
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,009
but the first process of avoidance
learning

677
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:04,830
is the acquisition

678
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,640
fear to atone

679
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,490
seligman and his colleagues

680
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,950
are predicted

681
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,430
well they knew better but

682
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,890
for the purposes of the experiment they
predicted that

683
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,899
if the animals already afraid of the
tone

684
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:20,910
then avoids warning ought to go even
further

685
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,970
even faster because you've already got
the first part of the two processes or

686
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,470
accomplished so what they did was they
took

687
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,399
the dogs

688
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:32,860
and they put them in a pavlovian harness
standard pavlovian

689
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,970
art of the conditioning a procedure

690
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:39,049
and then just presented the animals
looked on par with which shock told for

691
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:40,650
chuck

692
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,020
tone for chart

693
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,230
on in the same way

694
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,500
that pablo pared the bell with food

695
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,380
dole with food

696
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,900
filled with food

697
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,809
on and they were able to show

698
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:54,889
that in this in this circumstance the
animals acquired a very solid

699
00:29:54,889 --> 00:29:56,389
conditioned for your response

700
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:58,820
to the tone

701
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,980
it's on the morning they already know to
be afraid of the tunnel

702
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,610
then they put the animals in the shuttle
box

703
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,389
where the tone came on followed by shock

704
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,959
the animal could escape

705
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:14,609
or avoid the shock by moving back and
forth from one side of the shuttle box

706
00:30:14,609 --> 00:30:20,319
to another and what they discovered was
that in carving contrast to the

707
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:20,790
predictions

708
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:25,179
of the true process of of my hours to
process pirie

709
00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:26,060
avoidance learning

710
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,410
the adults who were treated in this
particular way

711
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,690
did not acquire

712
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,420
the avoidance response okay they failed

713
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,080
avoidance learning

714
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,399
very retarded

715
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:41,090
on the part of these animals

716
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,090
here we have

717
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,920
a lot of what one of their experiments
boys or in the shuttle box

718
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,640
these animals were treated

719
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,539
some battles were treated with

720
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:50,240
fall

721
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,330
one signal

722
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,990
inescapable shock with just a shock came
on

723
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,409
they had no kind of predictions at all

724
00:30:56,409 --> 00:30:57,190
okay

725
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,130
and then some animals

726
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,150
all broad got a signal

727
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,120
on shock

728
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,259
and here

729
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:05,990
art the results of the expert

730
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:09,279
control animals that didn't get any
treatment at all locais

731
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,370
they make the avoidance response really
fast

732
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,480
here are the animals that got the

733
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,760
all the inescapable shock

734
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,580
the prove the pre shock treatment

735
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,100
and you can see

736
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,179
there are lots of a skate failures

737
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:26,309
and when they did when the animal's did
make a mistake they took a long time

738
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:27,230
doing it

739
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:32,500
this is the phenomenon of learned
helplessness

740
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,210
preconditioning

741
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,299
to the condition stimulus

742
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:37,420
actually retards

743
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,079
acquisition

744
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:40,520
of aneil of avoidance response

745
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,159
here is another

746
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:42,619
example

747
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:45,220
on another version of this

748
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,410
on the animals or of these are control
levels that they'll get any kind of

749
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,380
pre-treatment

750
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,490
okay

751
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,510
alone

752
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,750
we have

753
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,500
animals that are actually allowed to
escape

754
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,800
when that shock comes on

755
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,280
and then these are animals that are
yoked to these animals to get the same

756
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,510
amount of shock

757
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,980
but they're not allowed to escape the
just get the shock delivered to them

758
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,600
then everybody's put an avoidance
learning situation and what you can see

759
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,340
is that there are lots of escape
failures

760
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,160
when there's a statement of everyone
wades for moderate onward helpless

761
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,669
so what happens here is that

762
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:23,320
your regatta illustration

763
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,690
not of the role of predictability

764
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:26,529
so much

765
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:29,240
as the role of controllability

766
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,400
when the alamo is in the patent lawyer
in harness

767
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,820
and he's been subjected to

768
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,830
standard pavlovian fear conditioning
tone followed by shock

769
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,440
coleman followed by shock

770
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,230
colin powell by shark

771
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,970
once the animal learning

772
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:52,299
the first thing in the animals for his
lease learning to predict a shock ok

773
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:54,270
tone has followed by shock

774
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:59,270
but what else is e-learning

775
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,930
tone as followed by shock

776
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,700
and there's nothing i could do about it

777
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,770
he's learned

778
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:10,120
that this is a situation in which it has
no control over the shock

779
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,590
and what happens now

780
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,240
is that the animals

781
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,740
generalize

782
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,899
this negative expectation

783
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:18,739
when they're put into the shuttle box

784
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:22,090
where the same thing is happening a as
before

785
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,470
columns followed by shock

786
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,840
helen's followed by shock tones followed
by shock

787
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,660
whereas a standard dog a dog that hadn't
been given this pre-treatment

788
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,660
run around and eventually stumble on the
escape of avoidance response

789
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:40,070
these animals literally sakin the
shuttle box and took the shock

790
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,820
they seem to be on

791
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,770
they seemed not to know that there was
anything that they who do about this

792
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,870
so we can

793
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,580
in instrumental conditioning

794
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:55,739
it's not just that voluntary behaviors
calm under the control the barman

795
00:33:55,739 --> 00:33:56,800
forbids

796
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,600
in the same way that in classical
conditioning

797
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,360
animals learn to predict

798
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,720
the events in their environment

799
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,970
in instrumental conditioning

800
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,769
animals learn

801
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:09,559
control

802
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:10,370
of beds

803
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,309
in their environment

804
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:13,009
prediction

805
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,170
and control

806
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,760
is what's been learned

807
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,139
in classical conditioning and in gone

808
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,769
had been instrumental conditioning

809
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:26,209
so that's basically what's happening
whipple learned helplessness experiments

810
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:27,419
exposure

811
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:29,519
inescapable shock

812
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,929
during the pavlovian fear conditioning
situation retards acquisition

813
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:37,229
overboard his response

814
00:34:37,229 --> 00:34:37,869
apparently

815
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:42,979
because the animal learns through the
classical conditioning procedure

816
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:47,029
okay the toll in the c_s_ is predicting
the shock but the situation is

817
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:48,119
uncontrollable

818
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,400
those negative expectations of control

819
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,029
now would generalize

820
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:53,830
from the

821
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,049
pavlovian situation

822
00:34:56,049 --> 00:34:59,429
you avoid learning situation

823
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:02,939
okay any questions either about the came
in blore we're going to do what works

824
00:35:02,939 --> 00:35:04,190
for me today

825
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:08,160
or came in blocking experiment or the
word helplessness experiments anything

826
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,160
at all

827
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,999
in the lower and helplessness thought
the situation

828
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:23,640
they were in that their environment is
in control

829
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,559
remember when we talked about the
differences between classical an

830
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,769
instrumental conditioning

831
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:33,769
one of the difference is is that in
classical conditioning

832
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:35,589
reinforcement

833
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:38,509
independent of the animal's behavior

834
00:35:38,509 --> 00:35:43,640
they'll follow by food tone followed by
shock no matter what the animal dot

835
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,390
where residents to mental conditioning

836
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,630
reinforcement depends critically on the
animal's behavior effective thorndike's

837
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,660
cat does impressed that pedal

838
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,279
it's never going to get out

839
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:57,829
of the are part of the other part of the
box

840
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:59,300
the prior

841
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,549
pavlovian or classical fear conditioning

842
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:03,389
basically

843
00:36:03,389 --> 00:36:05,259
taught the animal

844
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:08,149
the toll was going to follow be followed
by shock it was nothing to do what it

845
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:10,499
was uncontrollable situation

846
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:14,030
whereas if you just put a navajo in an
avoidance learning situation

847
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,400
in the shuttle box

848
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,049
what it will do is it will not only look
for a way to predict

849
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:20,080
what's going on

850
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,150
it will look for a way to control what's
going on

851
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,479
these animals had already worked to help
us out of animals

852
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:30,209
had already learned

853
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:31,160
control

854
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,599
anything in their environment

855
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,289
tone was going to be followed by shock

856
00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:35,909
no matter what they did

857
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:38,159
was out okay

858
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:45,159
anything else about helplessness or the
block it's permit

859
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,119
though the animals fear or diminish once
they realized the shocks unavoidable

860
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,480
well what happens

861
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,309
to be honest with you

862
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:02,380
what though that the fear that the
animal show the condition fear is

863
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:07,319
eventually replaced by what you can only
call depression

864
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:10,890
if you've ever looked the diversity of
said dog

865
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,459
these are very sad dogs

866
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:14,490
on big big

867
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:19,490
dave whimper day looks said that kind of
a book kind of downturn faces just

868
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,080
bother

869
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,279
there at their mammals after all they
have

870
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:25,269
facial expressions of emotion just like
we do

871
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:29,019
on seligman himself has suggested
learned helplessness

872
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:32,789
can be a laboratory model for some kinds
of depression

873
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:37,670
and indeed in some depressed individuals
not all depressed individuals but some

874
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,909
depressed individuals

875
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:41,340
we find that they show and your

876
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,939
all life-history

877
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:45,889
uncontrollable

878
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,049
the things just

879
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:50,619
that things happen to them they seem not
to be able to control them at all

880
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:53,220
on and that's why you think that the
press

881
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,210
when bad things happen to you

882
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,329
and you can control those bad things

883
00:37:57,329 --> 00:37:59,789
you either get determined

884
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:02,309
or you get angry

885
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:04,290
but when bad things happen to you

886
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,029
and you can control them

887
00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:09,309
eventually what happens is you get
resigning

888
00:38:09,309 --> 00:38:13,109
and that's what these animals they just
kind of get resigned to this whole thing

889
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:14,349
als they'll sit there

890
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:18,679
now i i want to point out

891
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:23,099
these experimenters were not
intentionally cruel to these animals

892
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:25,919
these exp six burns didn't go on forever

893
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:26,769
okay

894
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:30,989
and in fact after these experiments the
animals retired to a very nice farm in

895
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:32,620
eastern pennsylvania

896
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,540
where they lived

897
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,239
very nice dog alive

898
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:37,379
afterwards

899
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,819
palm barked at all

900
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:42,779
for the purposes of the experiment

901
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:43,720
this was

902
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,089
not a good thing to do

903
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:48,249
fortunately seligman and his colleagues

904
00:38:48,249 --> 00:38:51,009
did the experiments right the first time

905
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:53,390
they had all the controls in place

906
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,769
right from the get go

907
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:59,089
nobody had to repeat their experiment
with the new batch of dogs to clean it

908
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,279
up

909
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:01,029
wrong

910
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:03,149
again seligman is quite clear

911
00:39:03,149 --> 00:39:05,429
that if you're going to do these kinds
of experiments

912
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:09,119
you have an ethical obligation to do
right the first time so that nobody has

913
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,729
to do it again

914
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:17,859
is depression irreversible

915
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:20,290
the depression is irreversible

916
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,509
unless you take some active steps

917
00:39:23,509 --> 00:39:26,250
what's element and his colleagues ended
up doing

918
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,960
was taking these helpless dogs in the
shuttle box

919
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,809
grabbing them by the harness and
actually dragging them from one end of

920
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:36,180
the shuttle box to the other

921
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,389
and eventually the dog's got the message

922
00:39:39,389 --> 00:39:40,349
okay

923
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:43,819
that they just took a while because in
the first place if your dog or somebody

924
00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:48,099
dragging your from one and the only
wonder what the hell that's all about

925
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:49,199
but eventually

926
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,399
the animals got the idea

927
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:54,209
okay just a couple really really really
long time

928
00:39:54,209 --> 00:39:56,619
but eventually they recovered

929
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:58,859
because

930
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,270
that they could control the environment

931
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,109
after all

932
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:04,929
but in a standard helplessness situation

933
00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:08,509
on b denied the animals just don't take
any opportunity to learn

934
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:10,999
uh... did they have to be shown

935
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:13,569
that the circumstances are quite
different

936
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:17,229
and just to make the connection to to
depression again

937
00:40:17,229 --> 00:40:19,949
there is one important all

938
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:23,669
uh... the psychiatrist guarantee backed
him back

939
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:28,089
all who won the last girl ward a couple
years ago for or his invention of what's

940
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:31,909
known as cognitive therapy for
depression

941
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:33,009
and all

942
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:36,279
back noted that a lot of the press
people come in and say oh i can't do

943
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:40,409
this i can't do that i can to the other
thing that's part of their depression

944
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:43,250
all and back strong invented a therapy
in which

945
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,129
he systematically taught patients

946
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:47,309
they could do these things

947
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:50,170
and when they learned they could
actually do the kinds of things that

948
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,529
they thought they couldn't do

949
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:53,290
their depression began to lift

950
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:58,420
in much the same way that helplessness
began to lift in these dogs so this is

951
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,949
this is an experiment that actually had
a

952
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:02,999
to wedged positive soared to it

953
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:07,789
the word helplessness experiment showed
how certain forms of depression

954
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:08,849
occur

955
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:09,960
and also

956
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,299
helped show what we could do about

957
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:17,459
that particular form of depression

958
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:22,179
anything else about these

959
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,690
okay we've now undercut

960
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,290
also four obvious options all of the
traditional stimulus response theory of

961
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,420
learning

962
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,249
we've undercut the assumption

963
00:41:32,249 --> 00:41:35,380
of association by kandi geary

964
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,369
showing that content you want to use and
the principle of association contingency

965
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:40,869
is

966
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:44,279
we are under caught the principle of
arbitrariness

967
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:48,309
by showing that certain com stimulus
response associations

968
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:52,309
are much easier to form and others who
do you can't just select

969
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,310
c_s_ is in the u_s_ is arbitrarily

970
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,579
and expect animals to learn them

971
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:01,049
we ought to cut the principal all of the
empty organism

972
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:02,939
by showing

973
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:06,930
you have to understand something about
the animals biological structure

974
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:08,989
how it's nervous system evolved

975
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:10,599
to understand why

976
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:14,169
pigeons can learn some things but not
others why rats can learn some things

977
00:42:14,169 --> 00:42:15,599
but not others

978
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,629
but now we've shown you

979
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:21,330
experiments are also undercut

980
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,229
the assumption of the empty organism

981
00:42:23,229 --> 00:42:26,619
by showing that you don't have to just
know what how the animal's brain is

982
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:27,240
wired

983
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,010
you also have to understand

984
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:32,059
what's going on within the animals mine

985
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:33,869
what does that expect

986
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:36,390
what does that think is going to happen
next

987
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,839
what expectations of control does it
have

988
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,010
these expectations are prediction

989
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,009
and expectations of control

990
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:45,840
are critically important

991
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,590
all for understanding

992
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:52,569
the behavior of animals in learning
situations and then finally

993
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:56,160
especially these last experiments the
cayman blocking experiment

994
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,860
and the seligman learned helplessness
experiments undercut assumption of the

995
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,009
past aboard

996
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:06,759
animals in these learning situations are
not being conditioned

997
00:43:06,759 --> 00:43:09,069
by the environment

998
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:11,450
caymans rats in the blocking experiment

for a predictor of shock

1001
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:18,089
they are surprised by the shock

1002
00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:21,229
there look at around to try to predict

1003

on the dogs arc

1005
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:24,659
trying

1006
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:29,339
to learn what control but what they what
they can control of their environment

1007
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,080
animals learning situations

1008
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,160
are actively searching

1009
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,550
for prediction

1010
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,700
and control

1011
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,600
there's nothing passive

1012
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,159
about the learning process

1013
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,859
the final point about traditional

1014
00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:45,579
all all of the theories of learning

1015
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:48,240
all which'll reinforced some of these
other points

1016
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,519
content on concerns the role of
reinforcement

1017
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,960
it's kind of a corollary to stimulus
response learning theory

1018
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,619
learning only occurs

1019
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:02,209
when a conditioned response is
reinforced

1020
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:04,759
in the presence of a condition stimulus

1021
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:06,719
in pavlovian conditioning

1022
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:09,680
the conditioned response to the talk to
the bell

1023
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,269
is reinforced by the press into the
presentation of food

1024
00:44:13,269 --> 00:44:16,510
in all within our thorndike ian

1025
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:18,080
or instrumental conditioning

1026
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:24,009
the conditioned response oppressing the
paddle is reinforced by escape

1027
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:25,510
traditional learning theorists

1028
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,400
held the view that reinforcement

1029
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:33,039
was a sensual to learning and that in
the absence of reinforcement no learning

1030
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:34,129
would occur

1031
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,690
either in a classical

1032
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,420
or the instrumental case

1033
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,429
endure

1034
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:44,059
edward seat haldeman psychologist at the
university of california berkeley after

1035
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:49,979
whom pullman a hall is named with a very
simple experiment inmates running the

1036
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:53,140
rats i'm sorry for the quality of
assault try to get out

1037
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,670
all of a better view of it i thought i
had done this

1038
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,789
this is actually a picture of coleman's

1039
00:44:57,789 --> 00:44:58,599
on maize

1040
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,339
he results kind of schematic diagram of
it

1041
00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:02,869
in this experiment

1042
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:04,069
all

1043
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:06,539
scattered standard may fourteen
experiment

1044
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:09,109
involves putting a ratna start box

1045
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:12,049
putting a piece of food in opens cheese
or something

1046
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:13,849
in a gold box

1047
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:16,740
and the animal will learn to navigate
the maze

1048
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,329
to get from the start box for the gold
box

1049
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:21,570
and the traditional view of this
learning

1050
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:26,370
is that lauren the owls learning of its
way through the maze

1051
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:27,819
is reinforced

1052
00:45:27,819 --> 00:45:31,670
by the food that it finds in the
goldilocks okay

1053
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:34,489
without that reinforcement the argument
went

1054
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:36,630
no learning whitaker

1055
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:40,339
so what poland did was paid very simple
experiment

1056
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:42,600
in which he had one group or rats

1057
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,150
that was

1058
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:48,509
but in the goal box and reinforced for
finding their way to the there in the

1059
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:51,970
starbucks reinforce refining their way
to the goal boxes the usual way with

1060
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:53,019
food

1061
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:54,330
another group of animals

1062
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,949
was just allowed to run around in the
maze

1063
00:45:57,949 --> 00:46:02,299
they never found any food in the gold
box they just were just put in the maze

1064
00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:06,009
and they were allowed to explore it

1065
00:46:06,009 --> 00:46:08,209
and that and that there was a group

1066
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:12,299
all was putting up in the maze for
awhile allowed to explore the maze for

1067
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:13,579
some trials

1068
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:15,209
and then

1069
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:17,479
overflowing

1070
00:46:17,479 --> 00:46:20,439
reward was introduced in goldilocks

1071
00:46:20,439 --> 00:46:23,439
here are all

1072
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:24,309
goldman's

1073
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:24,890
results

1074
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:29,709
we've got animals being tested over a
period of sixteen days

1075
00:46:29,709 --> 00:46:32,950
here is a group that never got any food
reward

1076
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:37,760
and you notice that there are more in
very much okay there is no real change

1077
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,310
in the amount of time

1078
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:43,389
it takes them to get from the start box
to the goal box

1079
00:46:43,389 --> 00:46:45,410
here is another group

1080
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:50,190
this group that is regularly rewarded
for food right from the start and you'd

1081
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:53,970
see that they've gradually progressively

1082
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:54,590
learned

1083
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:55,999
their way

1084
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,480
the gold box this is a standard

1085
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,680
instrumental conditioning

1086
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,999
kind of outcome

1087
00:47:00,999 --> 00:47:03,599
but look at what happens with this group

1088
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,189
that received no reward for the first
ten days of the experiment

1089
00:47:09,189 --> 00:47:12,140
and then dale by the solemnly

1090
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:17,040
when they got to the good did to log a
particular place in the uh... in in the

1091
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,880
old days

1092
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,279
they found

1093
00:47:19,279 --> 00:47:20,769
of food reward

1094
00:47:20,769 --> 00:47:22,059
what happens here

1095
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:24,799
is that for the first ten days

1096
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:29,969
these animals behaved just like animals
that are getting any form of reward

1097
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:31,069
that's not surprising

1098
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:33,929
they are not getting any food reward
okay

1099
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:35,299
but no

1100
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:36,510
on bail darden

1101
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:39,290
their behavior changes precipitously

1102
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,459
once they discover

1103
00:47:40,459 --> 00:47:44,160
that there is food in the box they now
begin to behave

1104
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,099
like animals

1105
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:46,609
that were regularly

1106
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:47,509
rewarded

1107
00:47:47,509 --> 00:47:48,990
these are most

1108
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,010
apparently

1109
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,139
learned over the first ten days

1110
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:56,899
how to navigate around remains

1111
00:47:56,899 --> 00:47:58,870
they had no particular reason

1112
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,850
if you will

1113
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:03,739
to yet quickly from the start box to the
gold box

1114
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:04,799
on day eleven

1115
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:08,299
they suddenly found out hate there's a
reason for me to get from point a to

1116
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:09,500
point b

1117
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,329
okay i get visa cheese

1118
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:14,959
and now they start running really fast

1119
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:20,149
it becomes clear from this experiment
that over the first ten days the animals

1120
00:48:20,149 --> 00:48:22,560
have learned a lot about the mains

1121
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,969
even in the absence of reward

1122
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:28,459
but they all leave put this learning to
use

1123
00:48:28,459 --> 00:48:30,419
when there was our reason

1124
00:48:30,419 --> 00:48:34,579
it was they don't want to put this
learning to use weapon they could

1125
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:39,559
usable learning to find their way
quickly onto this is a phenomenon known

1126
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:41,569
as the latent learning

1127
00:48:41,569 --> 00:48:46,509
and poland argued that learning occurs
in the absence of reward

1128
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:52,509
what re will reward does is get the
animal to act on what it's learned

1129
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:56,469
get the animal to behave unicorns

1130
00:48:56,469 --> 00:48:57,969
its word

1131
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:00,749
so finally we can say

1132
00:49:00,749 --> 00:49:05,199
with the late morning experiments it
makes it very clear what it is a steel

1133
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:07,499
or in the morning

1134
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:11,739
in classical and instrumental
conditioning all these various variance

1135
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:17,899
on these experiments the animals are not
simply acquiring associations between

1136
00:49:17,899 --> 00:49:20,069
stimuli and responses

1137
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:25,259
rather what these animals are doing
requiring expectations

1138
00:49:25,259 --> 00:49:30,239
in the classical case expectations about
the outcomes of events

1139
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:32,630
tones going to be followed by food

1140
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:37,690
in the instrumental case expectations
about the outcomes of their own behavior

1141
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:43,329
pressing a pedal is going to cut is
going to be followed by of landscape

1142
00:49:43,329 --> 00:49:48,469
predictability and controllability
what's happening here is that animals

1143
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:54,449
are not just changing their behavior

1144
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:57,950
result of experience which is our
traditional definition of learning

1145
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:02,659
these animals are acquiring knowledge
about their world

1146
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:07,049
knowledge about what's going to happen
knowledge about what's going to control

1147
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:08,229
what

1148
00:50:08,229 --> 00:50:13,319
dollars and labels them to predict and
control the world about them

1149
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:18,130
will say more about how organisms
acquire knowledge next week when we talk

1150
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,680
about sensation and perception

1151
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,259
thank you very much had a good weekend
