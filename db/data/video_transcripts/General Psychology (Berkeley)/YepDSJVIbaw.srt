1
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,820
okay but return to our consideration of personality
social interaction

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,289
but before we do that

3
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:19,830
let me remind you that there's of second determine
this class next week

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,920
on Wednesday the fourteenth

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,730
on ordinarily I do exams on Wednesday send
in class reviews on mondays

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,520
but Monday it turns out to be a holiday and
that has really screwed up the schedule on

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,860
of completely

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,180
also we're going to have a look upon changes
here

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,220
first they detonated scheduled for next Wednesday
November fourteenth

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,380
it'll cover all the material that we've been
working on all

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,030
since the last lecture

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,620
the betrayal of memory

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,020
on what and language and on personality and
social interaction

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,220
but order on the schedule we cut it in class
review sessions scheduled for Wednesday

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,170
it's just too soon you not ready for a think
let's review session on

16
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,050
oh a week before the exam I know that

17
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,650
on randy sides are usually do for lectures
on personal and social interaction

18
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,710
and it's just too much to try to compress
it different

19
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,490
well instead of going and let's review one
Wednesday this week

20
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,950
all we're going down have of fourth lecture
on personality and social interactions said

21
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,979
and I'm going to provide on a court web site

22
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:31,939
you written all review narrative to go along
with love with the modified flights that worked

23
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:34,540
out really well let's line

24
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,250
exam scores were very good

25
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,680
though all going to make that the in practice

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,770
well remember there are lots of reports that
three times the rate in review fashion will

27
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,070
go up on the web site all

28
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,040
of whereby Thursday only further than that

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,570
a study guide for the glide impact is available
for you

30
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,700
all sorts of materials on the on a court web
site

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,829
and in addition

32
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:02,609
if you had any questions about any of the
material in lecture or the readings for the

33
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:03,200
course

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,149
you can't police those questions forum on
a quote on a court web site

35
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:12,129
and i'll get to it and for very very quickly
within twenty four hours

36
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:14,650
the deadline for both of those questions is

37
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,499
do it on Tuesday the thirteenth but the day
before the them

38
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:21,560
on if you have any questions the role

39
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,899
just put them to the the forum on a court
web site

40
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:26,909
and will get the ball

41
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,949
we'll get the majority

42
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,879
on the ground format famous before fifty both
of which were after this ball

43
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,969
computer scoring it down

44
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:40,759
all right we have a road directly from the
lectures rock we have drawn from the pact

45
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:45,200
on it and you need to bring in one of those
raids can't run forms that we talked about

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,159
on people

47
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,179
and a couple of number two pencils

48
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,790
that's what this can't run for a look like

49
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,679
two different sides

50
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:58,580
though many questions about what going to
do

51
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,469
we're not gonna read in session on Wednesday

52
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:04,249
the polls they would review instead

53
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:05,650
deborah going to have a fourth

54
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,949
lecture on personality and social interaction

55
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:14,409
any questions about that yet

56
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:18,999
well these are not committed to the midterms
are gone through with it

57
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,029
though

58
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:25,149
what we've been covering since the last mid-term
is the work of memory

59
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:26,680
thinking language

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,139
personally and social interaction at them

61
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:30,629
on

62
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:35,839
the final exam however is cumulative and walk
over

63
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:36,949
anything else about this

64
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:39,599
when yes

65
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,599
the on know the appendix remember called is
going to be tested a on bell final exam

66
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,329
but again it's just the material things the
last mid-term

67
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,400
what language

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,389
person on air force one correction

69
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:00,469
they'll have a chance to this later knowledge
of the statistical appendix on the %uh on

70
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:04,379
the phone with them

71
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:10,839
okay last time we focused on what I call the
dialect it between a person and his or her

72
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:11,799
behavior

73
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:13,120
on the one hand

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,319
how

75
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,680
personal actor the youth of the individual

76
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,559
his or her trade said attitudes

77
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:23,239
leave the person to behave in particular way

78
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:27,249
but also how the individual's behavior

79
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:28,810
the back

80
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,690
touche

81
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,649
and change the characteristics of the individual
him or herself

82
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,069
and now what we want to do

83
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,629
don't you think that model you look at the
next

84
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:41,590
by elected

85
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,560
the diet elected between the environment

86
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,689
and behavior

87
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:49,830
how features of the environment

88
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,689
shape the behavior that occurred the night
in borrowing

89
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:54,210
and then hollow

90
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,640
the behavior that occurs and the environment

91
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,750
and the back

92
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,669
to change

93
00:04:58,669 --> 00:04:59,920
the environment

94
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,270
on it fell

95
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,460
well first let's look at the influence of
the situation for the environment on behavior

96
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,810
here is a classic

97
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,709
demonstration and social psychology

98
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,490
of social influence on behavior

99
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,899
mcdermott by phone and hash no now defeat

100
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,800
all

101
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,689
on nonconformity

102
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:23,620
what after it was to present with objects
with a

103
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,919
but that ordinary simple looking perceptual
pat

104
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,340
it showed on the a standard line like that
line day

105
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,160
and then they come the onset of three comparison
lines one

106
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,739
to and three

107
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:40,080
and the subjects path with earthly to identify

108
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,919
which comparison line

109
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,040
once the famous in line

110
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,929
as the standard line

111
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,580
very simple

112
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,380
and of course

113
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,940
if the sometimes

114
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,960
all the dust beyond beyond judgment was

115
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,330
but easy one as it is in this case

116
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,250
other times the judgment was a little bit
more difficult

117
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,330
but it's a very very straightforward task

118
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,080
what action that dead

119
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,580
what's true very the conditions of testing

120
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,399
well the subjects

121
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,169
performed that have

122
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,389
working on loan in a laboratory room so they
were isolated

123
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:15,810
and other thought it

124
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,680
were all would perform its past

125
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,710
the and by a group setting

126
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,499
where there are a number of subjects he did
around the young around the table

127
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:27,289
now the front it was cold

128
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:30,320
that these other individuals to deter on the
table

129
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,020
were college students just like himself

130
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,830
work more

131
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,960
on undergraduate back when actually that swarthmore
college

132
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,650
bomb but in fact

133
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,970
everybody else around the table with a confederate

134
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,259
all of the experimenter

135
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:45,849
they were referred to suspend

136
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:48,409
for following a script that had been prepared

137
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,090
why did her mentor

138
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,979
all for it all for for them to all of for
them to follow

139
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,389
and what did what did that

140
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,830
on the phone trials

141
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,960
they had not been rendered a judgment

142
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,990
that was the one that a mostly opposed

143
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,000
own judgment

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,009
well here

145
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,990
it's pretty obvious that

146
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,139
comparison want to

147
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,379
it's the same the line as of as the standard
line

148
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,180
the thought it would say I think it's going
to

149
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,860
and all the other subject

150
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,580
with day

151
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,909
I think it's line three

152
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:24,009
or by the or the thing I think is what one

153
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:26,489
then there are some trials

154
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:29,620
the confederates announced their judgment
for

155
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,559
and the subject went wild

156
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,840
and the object of the experiment

157
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,189
what's the city

158
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:38,419
whether the subject weather and under what
circumstances

159
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:39,669
the object would

160
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,219
could before

161
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:44,100
judgments of the other subject

162
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,730
and and make and ever

163
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,810
in on in his own in his perception

164
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,729
here are the basic results of the experiment

165
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:52,780
when

166
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,249
subjects are wrong alone they rarely made
an error

167
00:07:56,249 --> 00:08:02,209
okay that almost always identified that the
of the correct person

168
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:02,860
however

169
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,210
when they were run with one another individual
who occasionally made in a row and his judgment

170
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,569
the error rates increase

171
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,569
if they are wrong with two water individuals

172
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,889
occasionally made a row his judgment

173
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:18,229
but subjects

174
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,569
all conforming responses increase

175
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,500
but I think we've got to be

176
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,469
three or four were fifteen other people

177
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:28,419
conformity increased quite a bit

178
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:29,719
well here

179
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:35,289
three all other people in the room unanimously
taking the wrong line

180
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,720
well as the answer

181
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,810
the subject of the is good for me with their
on of judgment

182
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,220
about thirty five

183
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,460
the time

184
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,460
this isn't a factor on the environment on
behavior

185
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,220
okay

186
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,019
but what and what's happening here

187
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,180
is that the objects

188
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:52,660
response

189
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,980
is being the dorm be be determined

190
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,090
by the behavior of other people in the room

191
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,310
even when they are judgment or wrong

192
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,329
if there are enough other people the rule
making that judgment

193
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:04,210
the subject

194
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,509
is conforming

195
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:07,130
on on there

196
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,850
for their role in his judgment

197
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,170
but what's going on here

198
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,760
is there is an effect on the environment

199
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,089
number of other people in the room who are
making that judgment

200
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,819
on the subject and the

201
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:19,610
to and four

202
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,649
there is another version

203
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:24,850
of what the on at the ash conformity experiment

204
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,570
they are the subject is on a difficult test
in a nice elation

205
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,800
or they're tested allies court of a of of
a group of seven

206
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,829
and what else did and that's one

207
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:37,720
only in this version the experiment

208
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,029
bond funds subject on from trials

209
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:43,230
the confederates arguing that honestly oppose

210
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,360
the subject

211
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,390
they unanimously give wrong

212
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,820
on other trials

213
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,550
the majority of the group

214
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,840
it is the wrong answer

215
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,680
but there is anything though this center

216
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,320
we thought we would get the would give the
correct judgment

217
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
hello again

218
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,780
here's the standard blood

219
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,810
the correct answer is to

220
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,880
on here

221
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,290
on fix of the thump thump trials

222
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,709
but from the Fed and

223
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:09,970
object will

224
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,470
of the six with them and confederate will
they warning three

225
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,600
but one of the confederates will day

226
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
the warning to

227
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,710
they were the results of that it's burning

228
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,040
when the

229
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,160
confederates or unanimous

230
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,649
in their own his judgment

231
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:29,080
the subject will conform to adopt five

232
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,760
well detroit

233
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,159
however if there is

234
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,800
what's the single the center

235
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,140
that's the thing will defend for from the
all from the view of the majority

236
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,170
and for me

237
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,310
drop down

238
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,220
to a very low level about five percent of
the trial

239
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,050
here is a perfect of the situation

240
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,390
on behavior

241
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,389
the object is much more likely to conform

242
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:58,600
when confronted with the EU and that about

243
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,270
but the unanimous majority

244
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,090
on if there's even just the fabled the Fed

245
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,209
just the the presence of just the federal
defender in the group

246
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:07,970
if the bill

247
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,980
should we do

248
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,360
the of conformity

249
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,560
but to a baseline level

250
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,340
there is another burst of this experiment
on performed by age are prepared for charlotte

251
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,050
bennett

252
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,210
here at the university of California

253
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,560
little bit different path

254
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,389
the public for that you

255
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:26,330
on making judgments of color

256
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,500
they're presented with little color patches

257
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,319
and they were asked to determine

258
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:31,970
whether the patch was

259
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,980
your blue

260
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,770
or whether a with a mixture own lou

261
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,829
and well

262
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,420
agree

263
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,000
there were filled with the phone to providers
the naive subject the group

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,560
and the way it is sad for me to set up the
patches are usually blue your blue

265
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,420
that with the usually say

266
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,199
and then

267
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:52,040
in the group

268
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,199
they're either there's one two four confederate
who wrongly George

269
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:57,040
the package

270
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,059
to be who green

271
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,070
what we want to know if

272
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,980
under what circumstances will the subject

273
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,060
we're obviously a doll

274
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,350
and for him to

275
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,350
the of wrote his judgment of the party

276
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,750
and you can see here

277
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,240
that when

278
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,060
on

279
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,420
object to what alone there's very little

280
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,210
and for many

281
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:20,919
when the earth

282
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,330
a minority of one

283
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,209
not too much

284
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:26,110
and for many

285
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,320
nor did to

286
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,370
not too much conformity

287
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,100
three people don't think that move green

288
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,840
the subject

289
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,420
the ferry its blue green

290
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,810
in fact it's blue

291
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,790
and that's with objects with a if they were
running low

292
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,310
these are classic

293
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,170
the thought of experiments

294
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,530
all demonstrating the power all the situation
on behavior

295
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,990
the are influence

296
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,080
five of a majority

297
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,329
groups allies and group unanimity

298
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:58,640
on the behavior

299
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,260
on the subject

300
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,479
here is another

301
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:05,500
all a demonstration of the effect of the environment
on behavior

302
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,000
our ashes the experiments had to do with osha
lynn Martin and

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,630
this is authority that has to do with the
physical environment

304
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,680
and this is bonnie anderson nineteen eighty
nine

305
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,840
in which is simply plotted the race of violent
crime

306
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,160
murder and rape

307
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,600
on

308
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,520
as a function of season

309
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,949
and what you can see here

310
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:27,029
is that the rate of violent crime

311
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:28,329
those up

312
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,790
respectively in the farmer

313
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,939
and falls off

314
00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:33,380
in the winter

315
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,070
on much less violent crime occurs in the winter

316
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:37,810
beth over

317
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,870
this is an environmental effects

318
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,510
there's something about the summer that brings
out mayhem

319
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,670
on in people

320
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,470
don't know exactly what it is

321
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,189
all black

322
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:49,739
the big the difference whether it's winter
reformer

323
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:53,730
the on of the ambient temperature whatever
warm or cold

324
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,230
%uh of on of whether crime is going to occur
or not

325
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:06,230
what more example of very famous example of
the influence of the environment of behavior

326
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,070
has to do with what's known in social psychology
is the frustration aggression by up with

327
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,450
also you know a problem that goes back a long
ways in psychology

328
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,840
what John dollar debt you melor

329
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,430
well I had an idea

330
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,020
aggressive behavior

331
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,050
fighting of various kinds

332
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,980
what is in fact a brief like serb response
to what they called frustration

333
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,530
they do find frustration

334
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,210
any off the cold the goal completion so there's
something you want

335
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,209
and that

336
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,789
that desire is frustrated

337
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:43,310
a reflexive response to frustration is aggression
interview

338
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,920
I had some experiments that suggested that
thought that that was right

339
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,670
but there were some problems with the all
all that with the experimental results

340
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,470
we need to everybody should

341
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,410
all of the frustration aggression of the

342
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,140
five-letter berkowitz at the yale university
all of all of Wisconsin

343
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,740
and ongoing work with

344
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,700
we buy

345
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,960
the original frustration aggression that office
that a couple of different ways

346
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,330
first to broaden the definition of political
frustration

347
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,109
refer to

348
00:15:12,109 --> 00:15:13,999
and the of birth of a band

349
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,480
that is

350
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,210
perceived as intentionally harmful

351
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,170
well if somebody

352
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,250
both of them to you

353
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,790
and makes you feel bad

354
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:27,890
as long as you perceive that think if anybody
was intentionally you that that's what berkowitz

355
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,360
called frustration

356
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,670
but more important

357
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,810
work with argued that aggression was not a
brief like the respond

358
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,730
to to frustration

359
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,079
remember that reflexes

360
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,400
our response is that occur

361
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,910
regardless of the details on be a book in
third

362
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,229
a burqa with that

363
00:15:45,229 --> 00:15:47,020
that's just not true

364
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,440
in the first place

365
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,250
all aggression occurs in response to frustration

366
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,520
only when the person is angry

367
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,670
okay

368
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,110
and is more much more likely to occur as the
response to frustration

369
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,899
when the environment

370
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:01,940
contains a lot of

371
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,190
the generational came with that deal with
that were suggest aggressive response

372
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,340
and work with them ran an experiment

373
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,420
off a missive permit on what's known as the
weapons the fact

374
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,620
the demonstrate

375
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,649
it was the young influence of situational
pews

376
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:17,529
on on

377
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:20,680
on %uh of aggression

378
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,829
on again and typical social psychological
form

379
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:26,019
a object of naive subject

380
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,399
at a confederate of the experiments were

381
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,970
were brought altogether and all you know that
it makes for a better world

382
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,429
and the on what the subjects were told

383
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,070
was that the they would be working with his
partner

384
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:42,040
they were told it was a confederate of its
permit are they were told it was just another

385
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,980
college student

386
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,950
they're going to work on problems

387
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,940
and then

388
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,149
after they were of the problems for a while

389
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:52,100
they be given an opportunity to evaluate each
other's performance

390
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,580
and we're never going to balance it out and
performance be good

391
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,009
all of this for a second

392
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:59,120
by deliberate electrical shock

393
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,530
on to the job

394
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:06,439
these subjects got to deliver one to ten electrical
shock through the partner

395
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,190
the Pentagon is the valuation of his performance

396
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,340
and a partner or was able to on do the same
thing

397
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,059
the experiment was arranged

398
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:17,830
well that the confederate always evaluated
the subject for

399
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,909
but the confederate

400
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:23,779
the liver a number of electrical shock through
the thought that these are not life-threatening

401
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:24,699
electrical shock

402
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:26,189
not like what you do when you

403
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:29,100
what you get when you stick your finger on
walls market

404
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,820
all what their rubber stamp

405
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,750
all of shock

406
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,010
and the confederate

407
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,960
but neither did the subject one shock which
was

408
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,850
pretty good

409
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,220
or seven shocks

410
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,870
which was intended to make the subject

411
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,860
angry

412
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,500
and then the subject was given the opportunity
to evaluate the confederate in turner

413
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:54,210
by retaliated against the confederate by delivering
a number of shock

414
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:54,860
again

415
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,960
the subject

416
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,510
he's getting on newshour

417
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,970
irv punishment is getting federal electrical
shock

418
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:01,940
okay

419
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,620
that's going to make him angry

420
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,830
and now

421
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,979
on he gets to retaliate

422
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:08,740
but the wrong if any man

423
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,400
is decorated in one of two ways

424
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,750
in one condition of the experiment

425
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,280
the on the room is decorated with sports equipment

426
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,410
badminton rackets

427
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,379
there is a yellow there's a bed that night
and that on the table

428
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:26,680
they're bad that in all one of those things

429
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,200
called bernie's okay

430
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,409
well hang it around

431
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,210
in the other conditions its permit

432
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,049
there are drugs everywhere

433
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,010
in the room

434
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:39,520
that I shot gun on the Wall there's a revolver
behind the bookcase fell be beyond the glass

435
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,120
case

436
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,409
on all court them

437
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:44,470
and across quo in the room if I remember correctly

438
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,910
all sorts of things going on to win on

439
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,650
and what work with the really interested in

440
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,490
what does the subject to

441
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,170
the pending on the room at the subject

442
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,290
is it

443
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,779
and what happens here

444
00:18:56,779 --> 00:18:57,529
is that

445
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:59,309
in a controlled conditions

446
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,240
okay

447
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,580
with under very good control condition of
the subject for not anger

448
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,110
there is very little

449
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,029
all aggression directed

450
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:10,390
towards the confederate by the subject

451
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,960
however

452
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,320
when the subject our anger

453
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,660
there's a lot more aggression directed toward
the subject

454
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,890
they're the giving the beginning the confederate

455
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:22,769
five shots on average as opposed to close
to the two or three

456
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:24,540
shocked on average

457
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,599
the all

458
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,290
the amount all aggression

459
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,670
it's increased

460
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,300
when

461
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,389
the subject is in President all weapons

462
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:34,230
but suppose

463
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,870
the bandits equipment

464
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,470
well anger

465
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,950
it was said

466
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,740
aggression

467
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,140
but anger illicit more aggression

468
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,350
when they're a situational humans

469
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,760
two

470
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,170
all of the data to an aggressive response

471
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,230
if there's what's known as the weapons the
fact

472
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,080
and like the ashford four minutes per man

473
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,690
it is a classic demonstration

474
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,210
of the power of the situation

475
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,970
the control behavior

476
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,160
people are

477
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,210
more aggressive when they're angry

478
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,350
and when they're not

479
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,940
that's a personal the permanent

480
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,809
all behavior

481
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,230
you know when they're angry

482
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm much more likely to address against the
one

483
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,020
if their or

484
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,060
situational Q

485
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,150
to aggressive response

486
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,790
it's been a delight this

487
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,960
that makes people worried about

488
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,410
the relation between media depictions of violence

489
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,330
and actual of the violent behavior

490
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,379
on the park old war of people

491
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:31,580
the idea that

492
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,789
there's a lot of violence in the environment

493
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:35,610
that's going along with that

494
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,320
on the violent behavior

495
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,179
role model from the people in that

496
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,070
the board

497
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,809
here is one more

498
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:46,370
on demonstration of the effect of the environment
on behavior

499
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,930
this is another classic and social psychology
known as the helping experiment

500
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,800
all budge on darlington be able at night

501
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,630
on darling of Latin a all brought subject
in to the laboratory

502
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,649
for a very straightforward experiment

503
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:03,710
in which they were simply stated in at a table

504
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,470
in a deal in a little room

505
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,049
and that's the film out a number of paper
and pencil question here

506
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:10,030
that was it

507
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,150
from the point of view

508
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,150
all of the %uh of the subject

509
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,790
but the figures seated

510
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,379
when the individually alone in the room

511
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:22,070
or they were seated with other people they
were given a packet of personal the questionnaires

512
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,480
the to fill out

513
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,640
and her mother left the room

514
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,080
on on thing no of the nearby know it can be
done it

515
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,590
after the experimental leave the room

516
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,070
there is a staged emergency

517
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,570
in one condition of the experiment

518
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,530
harmless vote

519
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,880
Paul begala of the start filtering into the
room through a ventilator

520
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,390
on chat

521
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,720
our in the other of of version of the instrument

522
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,780
all after the thought it would work in for
a little while

523
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,160
they hear an enormous crash

524
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,609
from a nearby room

525
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:57,340
and then the person holding out

526
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,160
I think I've broken my way

527
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,230
the object of its permit is this the whether
people will actually doing something

528
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,200
in response to that emergency

529
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,330
and smoke is going through the ventilator
chapel that to get up and do something of

530
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,160
a that

531
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,929
when they hear the crash of a person's they
help by broken my way

532
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:20,570
will they actually go to render assistance

533
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,590
the of results of the experiment were quite
were quite dramatic

534
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,480
when subjects were alone in the room

535
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,990
they were very likely

536
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,410
assistant

537
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,480
or to read and think assistance in the case
of the smoke

538
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,309
or render assistance in the case on the on

539
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:40,030
advocates of the crash

540
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,570
however

541
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,290
when thought its work

542
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,679
it'd in a group

543
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,490
of individuals

544
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:46,970
barry

545
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,740
on likely to do anything about the we just
sat there

546
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,049
well the smoke was coming in through the bentley
here

547
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:58,080
and on is a little bit more healthy behavior
in the foot version of the experiment

548
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,010
but Phil

549
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,040
all

550
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,059
when the all

551
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:03,180
leon forty percent of the cajuns

552
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,080
well did did the subject

553
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,090
and the help

554
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,259
but here again

555
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:09,049
we have an illustration

556
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:12,880
of the effect on the environment on

557
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,700
behavior

558
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,149
in the that permits

559
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:15,740
people were

560
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,039
much more likely

561
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,690
to help if they were alone

562
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,560
and when other people were in the room

563
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,730
in these experiments

564
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,500
the presence of other people actually the
presence of other people the environment

565
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,820
actually deterrent

566
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,929
helping behavior

567
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:33,440
oh that's thousand always happened

568
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,470
on top and

569
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,190
the president's of other people the environment
can

570
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,220
the silicon

571
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:39,910
behavior

572
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,820
here it is

573
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,750
all that experiment on run by Brian and pass

574
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,650
of the dog and never to abortion for the experiment

575
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,549
first looking back she conducted on California
highway one the pacific coast highway

576
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:55,950
all where a yellow of of you know college
student

577
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,399
was of station

578
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:58,900
well by the side of the road

579
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,110
with a call or with obviously flat tire

580
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,670
she's just

581
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,450
this in nineteen sixty seven that the back
before

582
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,550
opal psychologist on women could change the
world powers

583
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:16,380
on but on the cotton curtain and got understand
the time here

584
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,940
all quarter mile up the road

585
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,350
there was

586
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,840
another person

587
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,710
with a car all pulled over to the side of
the road

588
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,879
and they obviously flat player

589
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:29,830
but there was also an the another driver

590
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,070
would stop the help that person

591
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,490
and the question is here

592
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:38,049
I don't what the effect of observing one person
help another

593
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:39,140
on people's

594
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,980
and at the

595
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,380
you want to help

596
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,330
there is another a lot more on Monday in a
burst of the expert

597
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,600
by the expert on earth about the salvation
army christmas catalog the kind of fee and

598
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,230
on between thanksgiving and christmas

599
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,049
and the subject for coming across

600
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:58,000
people just ordinary people were coming across
the parking lot

601
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,450
the idea of the expert or arranged or

602
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,009
but when to very conspicuously put money

603
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,360
the and the donation

604
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,279
of their cattle

605
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,810
and then the question is

606
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,740
what's the effect

607
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,390
on this modeling

608
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,029
on other people

609
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:12,420
the

610
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,550
the building

611
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,860
here or the on

612
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,669
but the results of the experiment

613
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:19,290
when there is no model

614
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,900
people were very unlikely

615
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,010
the stop and help

616
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,080
the woman bit

617
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,530
the flat player

618
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,879
when there was a lot

619
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:29,380
quarter mile up the road

620
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,500
twice as likely

621
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,100
to %uh to hell

622
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,669
when there's no model

623
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:34,810
people

624
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:38,710
the salvation of donated to the salvation
army cattle only about fifty percent of the

625
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,290
time

626
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,450
but when there was a model

627
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,820
for donation

628
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,649
model leone the donations went up

629
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:47,830
to about seventy five percent of the poor

630
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,429
again

631
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:51,750
this is an affect on the environment on behavior

632
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,779
the presence of other people

633
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:56,360
and what other people were doing

634
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,510
those are pictures on the environment

635
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,210
of fact

636
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,280
the behavior

637
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,320
of people

638
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,710
in that environment

639
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,150
the literature of social psychology it is

640
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,520
on demonstrations

641
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,010
all of these

642
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:09,629
situational

643
00:26:09,629 --> 00:26:11,159
or environmental

644
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:13,200
all of fact on behavior

645
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,300
when you go through

646
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,749
the social psychology chapters of gleckman

647
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:17,940
you all see that

648
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:23,809
the again the the young the young traditional
model for social psychology is is being numb

649
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:25,399
what do you call it here

650
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:27,620
get away from aspect of the environment

651
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,190
and see what the effect of that manipulation
is

652
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,470
on the subject

653
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,910
but it's a also the case

654
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,310
that the behavior of of people

655
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,670
changes

656
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,800
the environment in which that behavior takes
place

657
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,550
instead of looking just at the effect of environment
on behavior

658
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,440
let's look at the research ripple effect

659
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,009
all the if you're

660
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,710
on the environment in which should take place

661
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,070
and we'll be getting that examination

662
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,000
on

663
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,330
address the confederation of something that

664
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,370
you remember for all learning

665
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,140
remember we a talked about instrumental or
off

666
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,760
behavior

667
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,880
in our discussions of learning

668
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,740
and if you think about it for a second

669
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,730
instrumental and operate behavior

670
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,510
changes the environment in which that behavior
explain

671
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,830
when thorndike's at

press

673
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,690
panel inside the puzzle box

674
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,230
that behavior

675
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,490
change the environment

676
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,590
from one in which the box was closed

677
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,640
to one in which

678
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,460
the box

679
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,999
that behavior

680
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:37,900
changing the environment and permitting the
state

681
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,219
when PF getter

682
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:40,990
or changes for pigeons

683
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,480
or rats to get a palette of who would if they
press the ball or that cokie

684
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,720
but behavior

685
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,970
of Pakistan

686
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,770
or press in a bar

687
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,940
changes the environment

688
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,530
well one in which

689
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,899
food is unavailable

690
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:55,830
to one in which

691
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,460
it's available

692
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,240
already

693
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,909
in our discussion of learning

694
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:03,909
we've seen how behavior could change the situation

695
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:06,800
of their remaining of instrumental behavior

696
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,779
is that

697
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:08,900
it'll be here

698
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,800
it changes the of changes in situations though
that view

699
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,580
organism

700
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,940
instead of flying from kind of me

701
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,670
family

702
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,519
and what we're going to talk about know

703
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,030
we want you know what you think about that
person

704
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,700
as a part of of the situation

705
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,800
persons in situations are not a separate if
you buy in of that as you might think

706
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,169
whatever the person dawes in the environment

707
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:36,309
it's going to change the character

708
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:37,459
all of that environment

709
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:41,140
the they're going to change it for other people
in the environment

710
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,809
change it

711
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:42,639
for him

712
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,429
or for

713
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:47,750
well if we go back to darlene let me

714
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,960
on helping

715
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,450
of of experiment

716
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,950
number the basic result of disability

717
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,330
was that people were much more likely to help

718
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,789
when they're alone

719
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:58,660
that may all or

720
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,410
on what when they're tested in the president's
of the group

721
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,929
and the question here is

722
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:08,240
what is that about being in a group

723
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,360
it's first

724
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,970
helping the leader

725
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,830
why shouldn't that but the fact that people
are a group

726
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,120
all of them make it

727
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,279
even less likely

728
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,369
that they will kill

729
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:20,710
in the case of emergency

730
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:25,170
darling of Latin a offered a it's an interesting
analysis of the situation

731
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,749
in terms of a concept

732
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:29,200
but they called pluralistic ignorance

733
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,780
is that what

734
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,800
the fact of the matter is

735
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,780
that even these to the test in situations

736
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,059
were from what and did you want

737
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:43,000
okay there's the local who are coming in through
a ventilation duct

738
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,080
but it's not clear whether that's not just
that kind of temporary situation the risk

739
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,419
of a clear out very quickly

740
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:52,470
or whether it's something that you really
have to worry about

741
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:55,600
yes there was a crash and there's somebody
asking for help

742
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,690
but this is a busy laboratory building there
are lots of people around

743
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,330
all maybe she doesn't need our help

744
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:05,620
maybe somebody is already on of helping

745
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,890
but what happens

746
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,980
is that what works

747
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,690
faced with an ambiguous situation

748
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,369
it is not true role

749
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:13,330
to wait

750
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,730
the thing that that ambiguous situation

751
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:17,720
clara fall

752
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,470
that decide that you waited

753
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,280
in audience away

754
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,510
and one of the ways we do that is by look
at other people the fee what they do

755
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,940
if you're walking through a park

756
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,580
on a of and audit in berkeley

757
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,649
and you think through kids

758
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:34,440
whiting

759
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,760
together

760
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,989
men have an actual and if you want to want
to break the fly at all

761
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:42,179
but you're also going to look around

762
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:42,989
the %uh

763
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:44,450
their parents are there

764
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,899
the take responsibility

765
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:50,299
we're going to look at the fight for a while
to see that the theory is fighters the visitors

766
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:52,470
horseplay of of among some kid

767
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,780
that situation is very ambiguous at the outset

768
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,520
you want to try to clarify it

769
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,730
for a while

770
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:03,370
no put yourself in a situation of barley and
let me thank you

771
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,149
you're in a group

772
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:08,900
%uh ostensible emergency is occurred

773
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,930
you don't know how there is an emergency it
is

774
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,210
well what do you do

775
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,179
you wait for a couple of minutes

776
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:19,770
what everybody else in the room doing

777
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,889
they are doing exactly what you are doing

778
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:23,100
they're waiting

779
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,230
for a couple of minutes

780
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,309
you are looking at that for clue

781
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:30,120
they're not the one that either

782
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,640
they're looking at you for clue

783
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,560
you're not doing anything

784
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,600
the fact that nobody is behaving the fact
that nobody is responding to the situation

785
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,530
hope that the fight that situation

786
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:46,000
as not an emergency after all

787
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,940
well here

788
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,809
all were nobody really knows what's going
on

789
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:53,629
the fact that nobody is is is on is responding

790
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:57,919
helped to define the situation as not an emergency

791
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,850
lack of action is the behavior

792
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,639
no what of action in a situation

793
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:06,600
change is the definition of the situation
from one being

794
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,260
the potential of merchants the

795
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,179
the one being

796
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,570
a on

797
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,680
so about on non emergency or whatever

798
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,710
that goes for the

799
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,930
modeling situation as well

800
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,629
people are driving down California highway
one

801
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:25,520
and they see somebody stopping to

802
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,140
help somebody changes of of the the change
of heart

803
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,450
the behavior of that model

804
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,760
it is changing the situation threatening of
for everybody else in that situation

805
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,400
showing that

806
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,679
it's possible that help

807
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,300
you ought to help or whatever

808
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,309
bottles behavior

809
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:43,080
is changing the situation

810
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,310
for other people

811
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,559
well here again

812
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:47,270
we have a case

813
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,430
the if you're in a situation

814
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,240
changing that situation

815
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,389
here it is another example all be reciprocal

816
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:59,330
all that of the environment the so-called
relation between

817
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:06,330
the environment and behavior

818
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,820
this is politics

819
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,739
why in the back room
