1
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,980
okay let's finish up our study of
personality and social development

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,960
today we're trying to make it worth your
while give you something to talk about

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,849
morrow

4
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:21,140
when you're with your

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,579
the question we ended up with last time
wise

6
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:25,130
why

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,130
is that their children from the same
family are so different from each other

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,130
these behavior genetic code uh...
studies for example

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,240
show that even identical twins who share
the same genetic heritage

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,319
had the same family environment

11
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:43,139
still turnout very very different from
each other but a lot more different than

12
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:46,570
you'd expect park to uh...

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,920
blood to be the case

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,620
part of the answer of course is

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,940
even though

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,780
children may all be the products of the
same parents everybody's got a slightly

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,670
different genetic heritage ok not not
the identical twins but everybody else

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,310
or the other kids in the family

19
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,400
have a slightly different genetic
heritage

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,750
but it turns out

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,409
that the family environment or at least
that part of the family environment that

22
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:11,000
is shared by all the children in the
family

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,810
is just not decisive for personality

24
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,159
and we know that

25
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,060
because when you look at various
dimensions of personality and attitudes

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,369
and other aspects of social behavior

27
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,100
variability within a family

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,130
is almost as great

29
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,580
as the variability

30
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,070
families and we want to know why that
should be

31
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,150
a the case

32
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,690
probably the best analysis all of

33
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,260
the hall

34
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,720
all above the forces of within the
family differences in personality

35
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,120
comes from a psychologist named judith
rich harrison's are written a couple of

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,009
very provocative of books on this

37
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,080
and that she has argued that

38
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,900
somewhat paradoxically

39
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,840
one of the many of the sources of
residents are pro-family differences

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,910
also lie within the family itself that
is there are things that go along with

41
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,409
in the family environment

42
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:06,389
the tend to make the children in their
family

43
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:07,510
different from each other

44
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,740
as opposed to the same

45
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,149
well read expect

46
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:14,690
our family environment to be the same
for all the comforter all the kids

47
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,869
that just turns out not to be hard not
to be the case

48
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:20,200
but harris is also made the point

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,380
that they're not sure if i remember also
extends importantly beyond the whole so

50
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,970
so that as soon as kids begin to

51
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,800
interact with other kids in their
neighborhood they go to school they go

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,699
to sunday school to go wherever it is
that they go outside the home

53
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:38,520
they begin to all interact with
different characters

54
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,219
and those peer groups

55
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,450
are also

56
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,480
going to

57
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,519
act to make kids are different from each
other

58
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,049
here are a couple of all of examples of
this what

59
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:50,650
harris herself calls for

60
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,729
group socialization

61
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:57,409
theory on phone of the vote of
personality development

62
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:59,209
and basically chuti argues

63
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:03,139
that there are two different aspects the
socialization

64
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:08,669
or rather there were two different
contexts in which socialization takes

65
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:12,949
place there's a socialization context
inside the house

66
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:17,469
where the parents are trying to get the
kids to grow up in a particular way

67
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:21,559
and that there is a socialization
context outside the home

68
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:23,090
we're teachers

69
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,470
or clergy

70
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:30,110
peer groups are and and so on are trying
to get the kids to grow up and i'm not

71
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,609
in another way

72
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:34,630
and she draws a very interesting analogy

73
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,670
all between what goes on as kids move

74
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,150
outside the house and back inside the
house

75
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,789
with the situation for a bilingual and
by cultural individuals

76
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:46,879
so for example

77
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,269
a kid who has raised to the united
states of the spanish-speaking

78
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:54,189
households or a chinese speaking
household it doesn't really matter

79
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:56,980
on it turns out that one of the things
that kids do it

80
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,079
are deductible speak spanish or chinese
inside the house

81
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,509
but what if it goes outside which is
going to speak

82
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:09,109
english or whatever language it it is
that that that they're here

83
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:10,849
of the peer group speaks

84
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:12,720
when the kid comes back inside the house

85
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,779
the trial is going to revert to the
language of the parents

86
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,650
this code switching

87
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,150
occurs not just linguistically

88
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,270
but also occurs culturally as well

89
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,930
so that wilder inside the house

90
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,300
children may conform through the demands
of their parents

91
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,229
once they get outside the house

92
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:36,319
they tended to conform to the demands
all of their peers

93
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,960
again there's a kind of code switching
here

94
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,869
and i think that there is no more
powerful example

95
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:50,770
all of all dot no better example of the
power of the child's peer groups

96
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,800
and pure cultures to influence a child's
behavior

97
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,389
than the case of food preferences

98
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,969
all of your two you were too young to
remember this now but when you become

99
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:00,740
parents

100
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,540
you'll discover that one of the things
that will drive you completely crazy

101
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,659
is to be is the problem of getting your
kids tui what you want them to eat

102
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:12,259
kids are notorious

103
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:17,180
for resisting other foods that their
kids that that their parents want to be

104
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,270
they're all sorts of interesting all of
the things that go on there

105
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,379
but the best way to get a kid to eat
something

106
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,970
is to show him or her

107
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,089
that his or her friends

108
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:28,629
the same thing

109
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,320
kids want to eat what their friends one
e

110
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,229
they don't want to be what their parents
want them about the

111
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,449
all it's a very good example

112
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:38,789
apollo

113
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:42,930
things that go on outside the home exert
a very powerful influence

114
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,129
on on milk uh... charles behavior

115
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:49,430
here is another example somewhat more

116
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,600
earth scientific example i suppose less
anecdotal

117
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,459
this is research by david well with the
university of arizona and his colleagues

118
00:05:57,459 --> 00:06:02,649
go over the years have done a number of
behavior genetic analyses of adolescent

119
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:03,599
behavior

120
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,810
all like smoking or drinking or
delinquency or

121
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,890
on having sex or becoming pregnant those
kinds of

122
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,839
all those kinds of things

123
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,620
and out there what is a merge from rose
studies

124
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,430
is an extremely interesting pattern of
results

125
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,599
that i think our best illustrated by by
smoking

126
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,440
it turns out that parents who smoke

127
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,479
tend to have kids to smoke

128
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,100
that's just a correlation

129
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,909
that's all

130
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:31,070
that's out there

131
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,979
and when you do the behavior genetic
analysis

132
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:35,300
you alcee

133
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,699
that the correlation between perished
smoking and child smoking is mediated by

134
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,150
the jeans

135
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,100
rather then by the shared environment
analysis not on like the ones i showed

136
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,050
you

137
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,629
on uh... on monday

138
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:50,229
but it's also the case

139
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:54,669
that adolescents and smoke tend to have
peter's fall who smoke

140
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:55,899
and that of course

141
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:58,800
is unaffected of the not shared
environment

142
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,880
so the general idea is

143
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,639
that paul while there's a tendency for
parents the past smoking behavior on to

144
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,750
their kids

145
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,569
through some kind of genetic mediation
whatever that might be some kinda

146
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:15,559
thing about the physiology of nicotine
or or whatever

147
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:16,050
alm

148
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,910
i think that this that child's peer
group does not experiment was cigarettes

149
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,069
that child is

150
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:22,870
not likely

151
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,460
to experiment with cigarettes

152
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,719
but if the child karoo is likely to
experiment with cigarettes that active

153
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:32,569
is likely to experiment with cigarettes
depicted parents also smoke

154
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:34,960
their kids going to stay a smoker

155
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,140
so this is a really interesting
contribution

156
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,380
genetic contribution from the parents

157
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,750
apparently to weather the kids going to
smoke or not

158
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,879
but also a huge

159
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,129
contribution from the child's peer group

160
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,289
address and his colleagues

161
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:52,920
have done several of similar analyses of
alcohol although consumption

162
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,530
of delinquent behavior

163
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,260
of sexual behavior

164
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,619
and all teenage pregnancy and they found
the same pattern of results

165
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:01,700
all the way along

166
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,200
that there's a genetic contribution to
each of these behaviors

167
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,129
don't know exactly what it is

168
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:10,919
are but there does seem to be a genetic
contribution to each of these behaviors

169
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,099
there's shared environment

170
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:16,259
is a very weak determined of these
behavior

171
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,820
button i'm sure in barman

172
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,080
and especially the example albeit of of
the adolescence pure group

173
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,719
is a very very very powerful determinant
determine

174
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:29,210
of what's going to are happen next

175
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,809
there's another all example from
tenderloin

176
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:35,649
who looked at all for the academic
motivation and all

177
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,900
well fourth and fifth grade children

178
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,700
all

179
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,110
in the schools that she studied kids dot
tended to form cliques you probably

180
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,600
remember this from your own elementary
and junior high school

181
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,180
all-time on in both in the school she
started clicks usually came into forms

182
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,819
all the brady kids kind of coming
together

183
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:57,280
and all of us slackers kind of hung
together

184
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,639
that's not a surprise

185
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,089
but it turns out that is a surprise is
that they boundaries between the brains

186
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:06,350
on the slackers are tend to be a tend to
be pretty fluid

187
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,330
so that over a period of time

188
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,260
kids will tend to move

189
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,290
back-and-forth

190
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,130
between one cleek and another

191
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,439
and what she showed us the instability
include membership

192
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:21,139
our kids are always part of one click or
the other but they tend to move back and

193
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:22,340
forth between them

194
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,530
and it turns out that kids attitudes
toward achievement motivation changed

195
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,500
when they move from one week leaked to
the next

196
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,420
sofa brainy kid moved into begin to
develop all friendships with slackers

197
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,970
that kid would tend to become a slacker
and not be interested in academics

198
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,480
if a slacker kid happen to move of the
conference with a bunch of brainy kids

199
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,810
that he became more interested

200
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,960
uh... in uh...

201
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,339
lesbian academic achievement

202
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:52,850
and the point here is that

203
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,780
kids intelligence i_q_ scores remain
constant okay

204
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,699
and prevent parental influences probably
remain constant as well

205
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:01,759
what changed

206
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,760
was the kids pure group

207
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,850
and the kid dot developed at it

208
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,740
on of the concept of in accordance

209
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,040
with whatever the kids pilgrim wars

210
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,480
when i want to do now however is
returned to the family

211
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,620
does the environment

212
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,040
and address the question of while you
are children from the same family so

213
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,170
different from each other

214
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,100
bite bite looking by looking in more
detail at exactly what the family

215
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,090
environment looks like

216
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,970
i pointed out call a little earlier

217
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,699
that there are these are facts the
forces of within family environmental

218
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:36,769
differences

219
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,499
and i want to give you art and example
of the above each of them

220
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:45,470
there is some sources are depart bom bom
bom within family differences

221
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,889
that are

222
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:50,990
stimulated by the child him or herself
these are called trial driven effects

223
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,820
there are some builders better off than
evoked by the relationship between the

224
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,760
child in his or her parents

225
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,140
they're known as

226
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,530
relationship driven effects

227
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,560
there are some that come right from the
parents independent of what the dc kid

228
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,170
does

229
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,270
these are known as parent driven effects

230
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,800
and then there are very interesting
affects

231
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,940
albany

232
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,080
microenvironment of the family itself
what are known as family context effects

233
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,230
let's look first

234
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,100
adtchile driven effects

235
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,260
these are very much like are the kinds
of facts that i talked about are in the

236
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,899
lectures on personality and social
interaction

237
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,370
when i talked about

238
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,330
avocation

239
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:34,809
as a mechanism for persons in situations
onto to uh...

240
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:35,770
in iraq

241
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,880
and the general idea here is where
something above the child

242
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,259
changes the environment for that child
versus other children in the family

243
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:49,600
and the example of already getting it
was a very good example of this gender

244
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,160
roles socialization

245
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,350
the family environment for the girls are
a family

246
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,910
is different from the family environment
for the boys myfamily there's nothing

247
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,879
about what the kids are doing here

248
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,720
it's just being a little girl

249
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,080
gets you raised in a different family
environment

250
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,460
then being a little or boy does we saw
this very clearly

251
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,180
in the baby x_ studies

252
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,629
where children who are identified as
girls or boys

253
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:15,870
were treated differently

254
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,120
of the independently of their actual on
gender

255
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,649
of literature has some other examples of
this

256
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,220
it turns out that

257
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,940
cute babies tend to be treated
differently than only babies by their

258
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,060
parents even by their parents may well
be about

259
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,830
it's just different

260
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,339
arm

261
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:37,669
uh... and again that's not good nothing
to do with a kid except the kids

262
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,760
physical appearance of the fifth day

263
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,090
arent so it's a thought and for the fact
that driven by the child in some sense

264
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,670
or because the trial

265
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,189
like you personally children just evoked
different behaviors

266
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:51,859
or for a lot from people

267
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:53,169
and that's also true

268
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:56,430
for healthy children versus children who
were killed

269
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,740
law ability who is we've got some kind
of like

270
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,580
chronic illness

271
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,650
is going to be treated very differently

272
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:06,029
on not just with respect to medication
and doctors visits

273
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:09,949
but the is going to be treated very
differently on all sorts of dimensions

274
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:11,970
compared to healthy fit

275
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:17,230
so here are some examples within the
family environment

276
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,220
different depend on whether a girl or a
boy

277
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,180
whether you're cute

278
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,490
or not cute

279
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,970
whether your healthy

280
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,839
or not healthy all good examples of
so-called trial driven

281
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,640
effects

282
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,279
are also some other caught by the trial
driven effects

283
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,370
that don't have anything to do with the
appearance of the trial

284
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,430
but have to do with the child's actual
behavior these are all of them sometimes

285
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,929
known as reactive affects

286
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:48,369
we hurt the trouble actually engage in
some behavior

287
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,360
that make the family environment for
that child

288
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,529
then family environment for of vodafone
for some other child

289
00:13:57,529 --> 00:13:59,829
and most of these react to affect

290
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:06,179
have to do with temperament it's just a
fact of being a little kid that altus a

291
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,440
little kids pretty much straight out of
the wall

292
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,629
five different terms of temperament

293
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:14,430
some kids are very fussy other kids are
very quiet

294
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,960
all some kids are very quick to get
aroused other kids are very slow to get

295
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,880
aroused that's what we mean by
temperament

296
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,429
all and it turns out

297
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,920
that these individual differences in
temperament

298
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,660
illicit different kinds of behaviors
from

299
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,220
although from their parents

300
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,330
and depending on how their parents

301
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:35,950
react

302
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,470
to these behaviors on the part of their
children all of them that the

303
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,670
environment will be different

304
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,190
for one kid as opposed to another

305
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,739
for example many parents engage in a
kind of cool

306
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:51,810
visited feedback with all of their own

307
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,990
with their children depended on
temperament

308
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,740
uh... in such a way

309
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,560
that auto within such a way of member
the what positive feedback is

310
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,920
is off the back and positive echoes the
deck that strengthens the response to

311
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,130
produce that

312
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,219
sold although it might happen

313
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:10,530
that a parent's who

314
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,520
produce a child is very quiet

315
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,740
but i believe the trouble

316
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,770
required trial

317
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,080
just left below stays quite

318
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,400
all by the same token a very fussy child
especially in the novice parents mayo

319
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,860
mustard all sorts of behavior that the
parents may think may combine ovens and

320
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,990
are intended to calm the trial down

321
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,999
but really have the effect of simply
making the child foster your

322
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:37,680
orlando and forcier

323
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,920
on remember some years ago i live next
door to paramount's current setup

324
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,010
very very

325
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,779
part of the collegue trial

326
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,779
and you could just hear the parents
screaming at the tip constantly kid's

327
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,420
fault

328
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,330
these weren't bad parents either they
just didn't know how to cope and so the

329
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:00,290
kid would start screaming they started
screaming extended screener day would

330
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,070
scream louder and i would just go on
like this for hours and hours and hours

331
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,950
i got a lot of work done in my office
here

332
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:14,080
similarly all some parents all believe
gage in negative feedback kinds of

333
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,960
behaviors

334
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,639
are better intended to somehow

335
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,130
dampen

336
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,370
or reduce

337
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,940
all of the behavior that god that that
uh... little of produced it

338
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,680
on some of these go by the name of lower
limit control behaviors because what the

339
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,250
parents do with the stated to approach
it is very quiet ok will look to be

340
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:33,850
quiet

341
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,560
but we're not going to be talk about it

342
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,980
so when the kids

343
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,760
kind of been

344
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,209
by itself for a while

345
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,290
no availability try to engage the kids
try to get the kids area roused

346
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,459
that's a different

347
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:50,750
very different kind of behavior that
what you see the positive feedback case

348
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,080
where required trial will just be left
alone to be quiet

349
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,869
similarly

350
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:59,710
some parents will engage in what are
known as upper limit control behaviors

351
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,059
this is usually with fosse kids

352
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:05,699
was that all will lead to foshan cry a
little bit but we're not going to do it

353
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:06,790
too much

354
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,750
ok will let you go

355
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,730
at after a while will try to get you
calm down

356
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,110
these are different ways of treating the
same kids

357
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,980
aquatic kid cadet positive feedback
remain pretty quiet

358
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,560
well positive kid to get treated with
lower limit control behaviors and become

359
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,130
a little bit more active

360
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,809
a frosty child

361
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:33,400
ten be given positive feedback that just
makes the teamwork posse

362
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,220
or the forty child can be treated with
look upper limit control behaviors

363
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,100
that'll tender quite required at the
trial down

364
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,149
either way what's happening

365
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:48,960
is that the child is engaging in insight
and behaviors that elicit a response

366
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,290
from the up from the environment

367
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,150
and you can imagine parents who were
born

368
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,410
we're going to get a quiet it is their
first child whitey gage in positive

369
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,270
feedback

370
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,600
they require child for their first born

371
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,500
but the second it if that is also quite
a sight

372
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,179
you know i for instance a little bit too
quiet too shy to advertise let's jack

373
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:13,450
this one up a little bit okay

374
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,989
so you get two-thirds reply temperament
buck one of which is a lot more active

375
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:21,220
of the book is born with quite a permit

376
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,679
but one of his own party turns out to be

377
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:30,409
of an adult with a was a lot more active
on than the others ok so here at twelve

378
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,539
it affects

379
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:36,520
with the process starts with the kids
either the kids appearance or physical

380
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,900
condition or some behavior

381
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,970
then the environment

382
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:45,500
response to that by treaty the children
differently creating a source of within

383
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,170
family difference

384
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:52,130
turning quickly to relationship driven
affects here we have sundial process

385
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,800
that's analogous to the former should
bode arvo bulb person by situation

386
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,330
interaction

387
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:03,200
as i discussed immediate lectures unnav
of the personality and social

388
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,100
and here

389
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,680
there's a large literature on what's
known as the temperamental fit

390
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,270
between child and parent

391
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,809
art you've got it introverted trial

392
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:15,030
introverted parents

393
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,550
introverted parents know what to do with
introverted jordan

394
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:22,400
they don't necessarily know what to do
with with extroverted part of the

395
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,930
children

396
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,700
so in extroverted trial is going to be
treated differently

397
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,010
depending on whether that child was
raised by of extroverted adult or an

398
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,950
introverted adult

399
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,890
and the same thing is going to happen

400
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:39,360
with an introverted child who is raised
by introverted adult versus a vet of

401
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,990
extroverted adult

402
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,080
forget the belt business whoever he or
she is

403
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,000
that child is whoever he or she is it's
the interaction of its tough tucked

404
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,390
between parent and child that makes
things are that makes things very

405
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,120
different

406
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,049
on you can imagine for example

407
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:58,619
and extroverted child

408
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:02,630
or into and extroverted into all of the
parents

409
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,320
little bit happy review eat better fit
into that environment

410
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,800
the next kid who comes along little
brother or sister is a little

411
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,360
introverted

412
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,659
is going to turn out

413
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:15,400
very differently because the
relationship with the parents

414
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,760
is are different

415
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,610
for each of these uh...

416
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,860
each of these two children

417
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,130
movin again

418
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,710
ga fairly quickly to the third category

419
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,440
the third source of all of the within
family differences

420
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,860
later known as parent ribbon effects

421
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,490
all of these are again often have to do
it or often independent of the child's

422
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,130
behavior

423
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,259
and i look at them sometimes to cargo
transformations

424
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:43,970
because they generally have to do with

425
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,899
how the parents

426
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:46,860
perceive

427
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,150
the trial

428
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,040
how the parents

429
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,210
tall

430
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,590
categorize the child thought if you will

431
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,649
for example there is a literature

432
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:57,769
that shows that

433
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:02,549
of the children who are unplanned before
that is products of an unplanned

434
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:03,230
pregnancy

435
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,830
tend to be treated differently

436
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,559
then children of of a plan pregnancy

437
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,090
calm that's got nothing to do the kid
okay

438
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,789
but it does have everything to do with
the way the parents view the trials and

439
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:19,470
the effects of the uh...

440
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,200
of the child on the uh...

441
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,730
on the environment

442
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,060
part of the family

443
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,320
all again there's a big literature on
identical twins

444
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,620
when bio parents

445
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,880
palm all uh... produce a part of the set
of identical twins

446
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,110
the major decision they have to confront

447
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,330
all follow they're going to treat

448
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,240
these kids

449
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,130
are they going to treat them

450
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,520
very similarly

451
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,510
or are they going to go don't take extra
efforts to treat them very differently

452
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,600
and again this is just a decision that
the parents make

453
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,580
about uh... about how they think this
post to treat the kids

454
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,909
some twins are

455
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:58,000
all given are similar names

456
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,780
they are addressed alike

457
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,780
the parents make sure that they go to
the same schools and have the same

458
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,870
teachers and purchase a paid and some of
the same activities

459
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,249
all their parents will treat they're
twins exactly

460
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:11,190
the opposite

461
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,509
they'll go to great lengths to make sure

462
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:15,090
in their own writings

463
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,549
that each gut the child will go on grow
up with a different identity

464
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:23,630
on the give them different names dress
them differently make sure they get

465
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:27,160
different teachers and hang out with
different friends and all of that

466
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,820
this is something that's not something
that the twins themselves choose

467
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,980
but it's something

468
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,500
that is imposed on the twins

469
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,039
and again art twins

470
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,760
whose parents make a decision to treat
them quite differently

471
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,679
by definition

472
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,990
have eight much

473
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,740
love much more variety and they're not
sure environment

474
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,320
then twins whose parents make a decision

475
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,710
to treat them of pretty much the same

476
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,980
another variant though that you don't
just have to be twins to get this

477
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,840
you can in the child although childhood
development literature

478
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,529
there are lots of examples

479
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:06,700
all of our so-called contrast effects

480
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,809
usually a contrast affecting the first
child

481
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:13,350
versus of versus later children born in
the family

482
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,110
all of its kind of almost by definition

483
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,820
that parents

484
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,940
don't know what they're doing

485
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,140
with their first child you can read any
books you want all but that first child

486
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,250
is our real surprise and lots of uh...
lots of ways

487
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,760
are there lots of uh... mistakes you can
make their lots of things you just don't

488
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,250
pay attention to

489
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,100
so if the first child is easy

490
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,250
offer example

491
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,780
paul the second child often

492
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,950
is perceived as more difficult to raise

493
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,660
similarly at the first trial is
difficult for them to raise later

494
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,860
children what may be seen as more as as
easier to raise

495
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,409
and that's going to the vet difference
in relationship between parent and child

496
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:55,790
is going to affect

497
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,940
how the child comes up bomb

498
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,440
avail

499
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,960
that friends well who's who had two
children both are both boys

500
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,760
or cool world of though the first one

501
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,770
has had tremendously large number of
behavioral problems uh... kids okay you

502
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,870
know graduating from college and stuff
like that but four able to touch and go

503
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,580
there

504
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,090
for the first off for the first five
eight

505
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,440
uh... years but at this kid was around

506
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,270
but there aren't they think they were
really didn't have any idea that the kid

507
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,520
was having any probs

508
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,880
on and so that they didn't realize how
things work for at their first game

509
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,600
until they have a second hit

510
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,800
was an entirely different you know it
can be like this

511
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,120
uh... and it was at that point that they
began to consult with foam

512
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:50,000
with those psychologists and others and
kind of get the first kid onto on the

513
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,500
track

514
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,230
but again

515
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,080
kids

516
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,160
or under the same parents

517
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,110
valvoline but the second child is born
to parents who were much more

518
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,330
experienced than they were the first
time

519
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,549
and for that matter the first kid is
profiting from the aloft

520
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:09,290
from the experience is that the parents
said

521
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,600
the second trial

522
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,700
so dead

523
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:18,090
then start these sources of differences
even within the same family even within

524
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,710
the same household

525
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,780
some of these come from the kids
themselves boys girls healthy six

526
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,600
whatever

527
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,460
some have to do

528
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,040
with the

529
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,750
between the personality of a child in
the personality of the parent some of

530
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,520
them have to do just what the parents
own

531
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,040
ideas about parenting and they're all

532
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,250
and their and their level of expertise

533
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:48,500
and then finally they're all of this is
very interesting set of family context

534
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,559
effects

535
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,990
we're all

536
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,230
there there seemed to be systematic

537
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,300
differences between author

538
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,799
between siblings within the call

539
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,390
within a family

540
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,080
calm

541
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,980
now we've got to think about those off
for a second

542
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:09,870
because it's very clear that months when
civilians ok there are no systematic

543
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,470
genetic differences

544
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,020
along dont win siblings in a family

545
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,500
all none twins have fifty percent of
their genes uncommon so random on

546
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,200
average and it's a random

547
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,450
fifty percent of the jeans

548
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,790
however there is an emerging literature
stillcontroversial but very interesting

549
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,710
and all of literature

550
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,780
that suggests

551
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,850
that there are systematic differences

552
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,930
already in in birth or or position
within a family

553
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,010
are sold out

554
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,720
or older children

555
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,820
tend to offered by a different position
within the family

556
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,949
than younger ones are due

557
00:26:45,949 --> 00:26:49,519
and this fifties differs differences and

558
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,000
family position

559
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,159
orbs their differences and birth order

560
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,450
have systematic differences other have
systematic co-author of impacts

561
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,380
on personality attitudes and uh... and
so on

562
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,060
all of the traditional view reason why
this is controversial all guarded is

563
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,720
the traditional views that there aren't
any birth order affects if you think

564
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,250
about it for a second there are all
sorts of confluence of

565
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,730
uh... that attended the study of birth
order affects home are for example first

566
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,549
boren's almost by definition of older
than

567
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:27,390
latter boards africa's it's has to be
that way so differences between first

568
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:33,440
words a lot of words might be an
artifact of bomb talked a lot of age

569
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,159
oda people lore in social economic
status tend to have bigger families that

570
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,260
people who are higher and socioeconomic
status

571
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,330
so the difference between a first born
in a family in a fifth or in the family

572
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,550
they have more to do with the
socio-economic status of affair with

573
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,820
scott five kids that it has with the
went within the first american firms is

574
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,180
between of

575
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,790
between uh...

576
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,530
about sibling position

577
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,929
and the end up in the past the general
view

578
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:06,029
has been that these methodological
contrasts account for whatever calm

579
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:08,120
though the periphery perfect have been
found

580
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,989
and there really aren't any systematic
differences

581
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,980
well i tended to birth order

582
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,610
that situation is beginning to change no

583
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:21,200
and one of the people all who's
responsible for this change is though

584
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,470
is a ghost a scholar who is that there
are two historian

585
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,590
who's turned into a psychologist

586
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,270
frank's all the way who is here at use
the berkeley

587
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:34,320
who ought some years ago produced a very
interesting analysis

588
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,370
of birth order affects

589
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,809
on personality

590
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:41,360
using the big five home

591
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,130
structure that we've talked about before

592
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,250
to measure individual differences in
personality

593
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,610
solloway is a big fan of charles darwin

594
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,050
alive and in the in much the same way
that darwin argued that different

595
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,639
species compete

596
00:28:55,639 --> 00:29:01,249
four unleashed within their environments
solloway argues that siblings also

597
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:02,210
compete for

598
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,309
well i mean shore up the their proper
place

599
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:07,450
within their family

600
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,890
although and looking back at the history
the family especially

601
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:15,559
uh... in the seventeenth eighteenth
nineteenth early twentieth centuries is

602
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,920
that what they are there is really a
very big differences between first

603
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,919
boards a milder brands especially

604
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:22,940
with respect to boys

605
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,100
and that is

606
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,419
that and in uh... the traditional
european society

607
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:30,620
first boren's got a lot more choice

608
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,389
of their of of their neesh

609
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:35,460
them and the letter boards do

610
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,570
on it you know i've been in europe until
very recently

611
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,399
there was a legal principle bonus
progenitor

612
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:45,240
which meant that all the family
resources got went to the firstborn

613
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,250
first-born son

614
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,910
and second with second what water-borne
funds

615
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,410
had to

616
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,900
had to fend for themselves on me to go
to the military maybe go into the church

617
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,150
or or or sort something like that

618
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,490
you could still see the are

619
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,090
do you know

620
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,200
hong

621
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,849
shadow of progenitor

622
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:07,450
in things like british royal family

623
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,470
okay who gets to be the next gohil
moderate in england

624
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,559
it's charles

625
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,889
why does charles get to be the next king
of england pressies offer son

626
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:21,000
okay no other reason he could be smart
you could be stupid he could be good he

627
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,520
could be bad he's still going to be king
of england

628
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,559
argues that it became immigrant just
because

629
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:28,429
he was elizabeth of force on

630
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:31,370
and stole all solidly argues that first
boren's

631
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:37,520
by virtue of didn't get getting this

632
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,710
financial and the start of the social
inheritance

633
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,570
released all of the spent a lot of time
pleasing trying to please their parents

634
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,779
by fulfilling their parents'
expectations engage in all sorts of

635
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,380
traditional behavior

636
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,750
and that although solloway argued

637
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,830
is going to make first-born children
tend to be more conscientious

638
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,640
and more conservative then water-borne

639
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,170
by the same token solloway argued

640
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,529
letter boards

641
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,810
are not going to get

642
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:06,739
the crown

643
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,500
they're not going to get the family
homestead

644
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,640
all and all that

645
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,700
so one matter boards are going to
threaten the authority of the firstborn

646
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,740
all and in in fact

647
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,220
fifth there's no there's nothing to
speak

648
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,330
letter boards are going to be more
likely to rebel

649
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:26,960
than husband first boards or uh...
because some of the first forms are not

650
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,730
going to inherit

651
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:32,050
dubbed the though from the parents'
expectations

652
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:36,570
letter words are going to seek all
different ways of getting are getting

653
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,120
distinction

654
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,850
and he argued the letter boring so
they're going to become more and patsick

655
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,470
more egalitarian

656
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,980
more energy authoritarian and they're
going to strive to be different they're

657
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,530
just trying to be unique

658
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,970
knots dr to be conventional

659
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,990
well that's the general theory question
is does it work out that way and

660
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:54,549
practice

661
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:56,769
and it turns out that they have

662
00:31:56,769 --> 00:31:57,750
although

663
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:02,310
when you are a look at all birth order
differences in personality in terms of

664
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,320
the first bought the in terms of the big
fight

665
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,770
it turns out that first boren's tend to
be a little bit higher on your bought a

666
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,519
schism

667
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:14,100
that motherboards through those of you
were letter boards can hold us over your

668
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,620
big brothers and sisters heads tomorrow
at the dinner table

669
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,320
all but it turns out the first boren's
tend to be more jealous

670
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,590
more anxious

671
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,929
more fearful

672
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:26,950
are more likely to affiliate with others
under stress

673
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,920
that doug wilder pornstar

674
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,649
similarly

675
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,290
with extra version

676
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:36,730
all i'll go first of the first the first
boards tend to be more extroverted

677
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,519
then of the latter barons

678
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,480
extra version has to do with
assertiveness

679
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,309
orlando again we'd expect

680
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:45,330
offers pour in to be more assertive

681
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,030
we're likely to hold them take a young
take a leadership role

682
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,480
and so they do on average

683
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,849
firstborn score higher

684
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:54,540
on measures of extra version

685
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,050
than of the matter bornstein

686
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,789
all similarly in agreeable to us

687
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:04,290
firstborn again a love letter boards to
underscore called all the higher

688
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,280
turned out that done first boren's

689
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,780
first boards one up

690
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,720
t_-thirty should the family against all
costs

691
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,590
letter boards tend to be a little bit
more easy going about these kinds of

692
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,670
things okay you can have

693
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,700
this thing in our own co-authored in
something else

694
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,440
of i think about charles is soft

695
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,390
uh...

696
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:27,740
younger siblings you know they're not
spending a lot of time trying to be king

697
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,990
or they're off the photographers and
flying helicopters and stuff like that

698
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,700
letter boards are more used to going
cooperative and popular

699
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,040
again you know differences you know

700
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,600
but they are systematic differences
there statistically significant when you

701
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,210
do the studies alright

702
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,009
conscientious

703
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:48,540
the bench refers read the rebirth for
the first born

704
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,179
first boards tend to be a little bit
more conscientious

705
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,710
than uh... all of them that the latter
boren's

706
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,490
they tend to be more responsible more
itchy but organized korea entered

707
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,300
more organized and plan for

708
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,490
there is an advantage provider boards

709
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,379
when it comes to openness to experience

710
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,109
again it's always does

711
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:13,950
letter boards to be born to rebel their
less traditional their viewpoints

712
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:14,929
and it turns out

713
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:17,899
the firstborn czar more conforming

714
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:19,090
more traditional

715
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,909
and more closely identified with their
parents

716
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,839
than are a lot of arms

717
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,090
also again

718
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:29,979
we see these systematic differences in
personality

719
00:34:29,979 --> 00:34:33,009
that have to do with all of them

720
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:35,400
what what position you walk it by uh...

721
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,619
the family

722
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,239
foley extracted these kinds of results

723
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,169
all by reading the literature and it's
very complicated literature it's very

724
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:46,139
very very controversial

725
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,239
also

726
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:50,669
just kind of forget go this forget this

727
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:51,379
ald

728
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:55,339
would really like to see although
somewhat more systematic confirmation of

729
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:56,119
it

730
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:00,930
on bill plus who is a psychologist at
the university of british columbia was

731
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:05,630
here at berkeley on sabbatical some
years ago and in the context of the

732
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,229
all research purchase a patient program

733
00:35:08,229 --> 00:35:11,109
argued in interesting study of

734
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,569
firstborn versus letter born

735
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:16,730
of personality he simply asked people

736
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,119
ought to

737
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,599
on consider

738
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,779
themselves and their families and to
identify vault butch

739
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:29,289
kid in the family was most likely to be
the achiever in the family

740
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:31,190
and which kid in the family

741
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,510
was most likely to be the rebel the
family members of the two was central

742
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,690
predictions of solely

743
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,480
the first boards will be more
achievement oriented

744
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,220
and latter brings will be

745
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,409
more of more rebellious

746
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:44,950
and what paul is dead

747
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:50,650
was to break up his cell of subjects
into kids from auto child families kids

748
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,350
from three child families

749
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:57,190
kids from four child families justify
chance

750
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,289
just by chance

751
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:02,530
artwork kids all from future openly

752
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,929
you'd expect

753
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,469
are the first born to be nominated as
the cheever half of the time

754
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:10,499
have the latter born to be nominated as
the rebel half the time has just by

755
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:11,489
chance

756
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:13,710
but it turned out

757
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,619
of followed this video subjects

758
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:21,080
dominated the firstborn is the achiever
about two thirds of the time much more

759
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,179
often than you can expect by chance

760
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:24,920
and nominated the latter born

761
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,280
uh... as the rebel almost two-thirds of
the time to get much more than you'd

762
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,789
expect by chance

763
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:34,159
same logic four altus of ships

764
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,790
three kids in a family

765
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,619
you'd expect

766
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:39,259
one-third

767
00:36:39,259 --> 00:36:43,640
all of those children to be nominated is
chambers just by chance

768
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,339
two-thirds of the latter boren's to be
nominated as rebels just by chance what

769
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,490
wiped off paul was discovered was that

770
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,429
in fact the figures favor

771
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:55,089
are there more

772
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:58,279
first warns nominated to cheaper said
you'd expect by chance not a big

773
00:36:58,279 --> 00:36:59,759
difference but it's there

774
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,420
and more letter boren's nominated rebels

775
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,849
and the same thing grows on for a
situation of four

776
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:10,269
more firstborn senator specter chance

777
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,660
identified as the cheapest

778
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:16,999
more letter boren's than you'd expect by
chance identified as as rebels

779
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:19,099
are just the when paulus

780
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:21,130
went back to the university of british
columbia

781
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,869
he did the study again

782
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:24,510
so these are canadian

783
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,760
are college students

784
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,169
and again you feel all the way along the
line

785
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:32,799
more first boren's that you'd expect by
chance

786
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:36,419
are nominated as achievers as the
achiever in the family

787
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:37,999
more letter boards

788
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:42,690
that you'd expect by chance are
nominated has the rebels and the family

789
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,539
so there does seem to be something to do
this

790
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:50,809
all of that for these systematic
differences in personality all of that

791
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:54,619
seem to have to do with the position all
of the child in the phallic there on the

792
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:58,809
same family brought out the same parents
the role of it in the same house but the

793
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,720
first boards in the letter boards

794
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,369
tend to be different on average

795
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:06,520
this is an every for sport is the
achiever right

796
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,020
and every letter board as the what is
the rebel

797
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,339
it's just an average that question here

798
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:14,099
stopped

799
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,810
only children aren't in this particular
study

800
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,630
but i'm going to show you that's
thinking i'm going to show you something

801
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,489
about all the children that i think is

802
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:23,989
absolutely fascinating

803
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:24,789
absolute essen

804
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:28,069
without your question

805
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:30,930
often accurate with respect to this

806
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:36,210
although i suppose you'd expect anything
that you would ordinarily expect

807
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,529
only children to be to be like for
sports

808
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:41,630
because well there are the firstborn

809
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:45,259
it turns out though all the children are
not necessarily the same as being the

810
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:51,449
firstborn artisanal respects and i'll
show you that day and second dataquest

811
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:56,549
i know exactly how it was conducted

812
00:38:56,549 --> 00:38:57,539
now what

813
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:01,039
but they did with of what they did was
they would ask you

814
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,699
with his toothless just imagine your
copy go to

815
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:04,799
too

816
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:06,419
two siblings okay

817
00:39:06,419 --> 00:39:08,529
they say consider u

818
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:09,980
consider here two siblings

819
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,430
which one is the achiever in the family

820
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,319
animates they consider yourself

821
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,860
consider your tues siblings

822
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,849
which ones the rubble of the family

823
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:21,609
and it turns out that you would nominate
on average

824
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,349
the oldest sibling as the achiever

825
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:28,630
one of the younger siblings as rebel
that's on the study was done

826
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,180
there lots of different ways to do this
but that's how they did so this is

827
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,750
really kind of

828
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,380
reputation within the family

829
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,390
did this happens unfairly sometimes all
you know

830
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,839
she's lost smart one

831
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,259
right kids know kind of who's who in a
family and that's what he was

832
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:51,259
uh... capturing

833
00:39:52,939 --> 00:39:53,539
awk

834
00:39:53,539 --> 00:39:56,999
in this i'm sure there were such kids in
this study

835
00:39:56,999 --> 00:40:00,649
but they didn't break it down by spacing
im go get 'em that they have a chance of

836
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:03,919
the list but no show your study where
space is actually might make a very

837
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:05,139
interesting difference

838
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:07,299
but again you've got a look at that

839
00:40:07,299 --> 00:40:08,259
although

840
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:10,309
in the literature

841
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:15,419
the general tendency is to think that if
there's more than six or seven years

842
00:40:15,419 --> 00:40:19,019
between siblings

843
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:21,529
ican kind of the clock starts all over
again

844
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:24,209
that your functionally and all the child

845
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:28,329
fro that functionally penalty trial ma
got two older

846
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:31,309
siblings my sister's ten years older
than i am my brother seven years older

847
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:33,299
than than i am

848
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:36,570
are by the time i was growing up i was
five years old man

849
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,450
brother was twelve-mile

850
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,779
sister was

851
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:41,849
almost graduated from high school

852
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:45,299
they were part of my life so much
rebooter disturbance

853
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:47,990
no i don't have a nice people we had a
really nice family was right in that

854
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,950
respect that

855
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,569
it's not as if they were around the
house a lot

856
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:54,949
you know they were off doing their thing

857
00:40:54,949 --> 00:40:56,410
arm also

858
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,500
did the use of these are family
constellation affects

859
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,519
really are only supposed to be

860
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,460
or holding

861
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,380
when there's less of a space

862
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,579
between kids

863
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:08,619
okay let me show you one more

864
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:11,689
these this is a absolutely fascinating

865
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:13,019
follicles study

866
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:17,229
all corporate order and measured
intelligence so-called i_q_

867
00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:20,980
this is work by robert science you've
heard seen this name before

868
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,590
all up and he's the guy who did mere
exposure affects studies he's now at

869
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,080
stanford

870
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,609
and a graduate student of his army
marcus

871
00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:30,920
songs all of the publish some time ago

872
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,059
this is a man analysis all involved

873
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:34,900
all of them

874
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,770
who'd of data that was collected

875
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:41,010
in the context all been invented world
war two known as the dutch famine in

876
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,930
nineteen forty four

877
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,849
arb dutch word occupied by the germans
there was a

878
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:48,920
massive crop failure that was already
going on

879
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,619
are and that there was a tremendous
amount of hunger and starvation in the

880
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:56,319
netherlands of doreen o during that year

881
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,059
it turns out that in the netherlands
every

882
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,410
mail

883
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,869
when he turns nineteen has to go there

884
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,890
does not drafted if universal

885
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,899
are drafted in in uh... in the
netherlands

886
00:42:08,899 --> 00:42:12,780
also all of the conceived of these are
kids so there's a study

887
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,860
of kids or aged eighteen

888
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:20,030
all who were born around the time of
this famine and and the the years old

889
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,099
right afterwards

890
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:25,580
and in the proc and then in the course
of their our military aptitude testing

891
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,330
they were given a non-verbal test of
intelligence is known as reagan's

892
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:32,910
progressive matrices which is very
interesting intelligence test

893
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,839
and what's the investigators did all

894
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,859
was to allot

895
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:43,040
score no average scores on this
intelligence test as a function of

896
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,160
family size and birth order

897
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,750
and when you do that you get photograph

898
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,609
that looks like this

899
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,420
here it is

900
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,660
transformed i_q_ score

901
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,690
now i want you to understand one thing

902
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,380
the difference between the lowest point

903
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,009
in this bill

904
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:02,719
and the highest point in the scale is
three points

905
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:05,170
on one hundred-point skill

906
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:07,539
these are not huge differences

907
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:11,459
but they are theoretically very
interesting differences because of the

908
00:43:11,459 --> 00:43:13,239
pattern that you see here

909
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:15,849
first is you see

910
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:19,670
well but have a rich like his court
tends to

911
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,909
did decrease as a function of family
size

912
00:43:22,909 --> 00:43:24,049
here are

913
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:25,430
to child families

914
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,769
the first part of the second borne

915
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:29,040
pretrial families

916
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,559
first second and third

917
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:33,449
for child families first second third
fourth

918
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:35,179
by child families

919
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:38,019
six trial families seven

920
00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:42,490
and dying child families as the size of
the family increases

921
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,000
the average

922
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,270
i_q_ score

923
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,909
pens to go down so that's the first
effect

924
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:53,069
the second effect is that within the
each family size

925
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:56,239
as birth order increases again

926
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:01,859
the i_q_ score tends to go down a little
bit so here for families the birth of

927
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:07,099
shirt size of two the second born score
slightly less than the firstborn

928
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:09,459
fidget fought size of free

929
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:10,870
firstborn second board

930
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:15,980
third board for four firstborn second
board their board fourth born can see

931
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,700
this

932
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,420
pretty much all the way down there are
some glitches here double talk about

933
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,799
uh... later

934
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:23,269
so we also have

935
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:24,569
on stall

936
00:44:24,569 --> 00:44:28,809
don't small but significant and
theoretically interesting

937
00:44:28,809 --> 00:44:33,089
declined and average i_q_ score
according to before

938
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:34,210
asked about uh...

939
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,750
than about all the children

940
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:36,750
there are the scores

941
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,069
for all the children

942
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:39,910
this is very interesting

943
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:45,460
because only children tender score a
little bit more significantly lower on

944
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,309
average

945
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:46,800
then

946
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,069
the first boren's

947
00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:49,270
over to a child

948
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,420
or of free child family even before
trial family

949
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,099
are dependent on uh...

950
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:55,339
what you make it

951
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:57,859
sold their art these

952
00:44:57,859 --> 00:44:59,009
systematic affects

953
00:44:59,009 --> 00:45:00,459
an i_q_

954
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:01,880
based on

955
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,050
scripture size family size

956
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:09,170
and also based on performer within the
within the population

957
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:14,599
here are the basic affects and advance
and marcus

958
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:18,950
attributed this pattern of results which
is now i've been replicated in about a

959
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:25,450
half a dozen large-scale studies all
vault evolve of i_q_ scores all

960
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,799
wanted to a number of all of the debt

961
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:31,430
different processes that they'd grouped
together in terms of what's called the

962
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:33,730
confluence model of development

963
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,299
are and what they're talking about here

964
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:38,739
mutual influence poem and

965
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:39,640
children

966
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,640
on children's i_q_ scores

967
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,649
okay mutual influence

968
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:49,149
there's eight dilution effect and what
science argues

969
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:51,650
every neuborne

970
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:52,910
comes into a family

971
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:56,990
of functionally diminishes the
intellectual resources in that family

972
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,339
that the reason for that is that

973
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,939
newborns a very nice but there

974
00:46:00,939 --> 00:46:04,479
you can't talk about

975
00:46:04,479 --> 00:46:07,019
particle physics

976
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:11,259
arm so there's a sense in which they did
each newborn diminishes the intellectual

977
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:14,119
resources for the families as a whole

978
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,289
fuck does also growth effect

979
00:46:16,289 --> 00:46:19,270
which is that ask each child grows up

980
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:22,330
that child becomes in some sense smarter

981
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:28,000
and begins to contribute more to the
intellectual resources of the family so

982
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,739
the newborn

983
00:46:29,739 --> 00:46:34,129
diminishes intellectual resources but as
per child grows up contributes more and

984
00:46:34,129 --> 00:46:35,189
more

985
00:46:35,189 --> 00:46:37,060
each matter boring

986
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,890
increases the dilution of the families
intellectual resources

987
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:43,240
but each early board

988
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,059
counteract that dilution

989
00:46:46,059 --> 00:46:49,809
when the third boren comes into the
family the first in the second boring

990
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:54,539
have already started growing up and they
start songs or the compensating for this

991
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:56,339
on a dilution

992
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:57,589
and it turns out

993
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:59,339
when the details of the mathematics

994
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:03,999
the spacing matters allot so what's
actually going on here

995
00:47:03,999 --> 00:47:05,420
the first is

996
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:09,520
that there is a teaching abstract on
high q_

997
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,600
and that is

998
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,709
that early boren's

999
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:13,339
profit

1000
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:17,959
from being able to in a position to
teach something four-letter words

1001
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:19,059
one of the reasons

1002
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:24,359
that older siblings the main reason that
older siblings

1003
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:25,669
score higher

1004
00:47:25,669 --> 00:47:27,460
then their younger siblings

1005
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:31,520
is that alder siblings have had the
opportunity to teach their younger

1006
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,159
siblings teaching makes you smarter

1007
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:37,019
so that's the first thing

1008
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:38,939
so this is teaching affect

1009
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,450
there is a last child a handicap

1010
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:42,009
notice

1011
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:46,340
that the drop-off from the next to the
last child to vote last child

1012
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,549
is very striking

1013
00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:54,719
it is typically much bigger than any of
the other intermedia dropbox okay

1014
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:56,690
what is the last child handicap

1015
00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:00,940
the last child handicap is fell last
child born in the family don't have

1016
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,989
anybody to teach

1017
00:48:02,989 --> 00:48:06,569
doesn't get the advantage of teaching
affect

1018
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:07,410
similarly

1019
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:12,300
there is and all the child handicap
there are the average scores of the only

1020
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,359
children

1021
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:18,599
and again the only child handicapped
comes from the fact that a only children

1022
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:21,029
don't have all older children to teach
them

1023
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:23,839
but they also don't have younger
children

1024
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,219
ought to teach

1025
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:30,979
are visible vs also have the same kind
of a fact

1026
00:48:30,979 --> 00:48:33,599
twins or triplets born into a family

1027
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,839
all they don't get to teach each other

1028
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,999
much there's no older versus younger
arms of the affect their

1029
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:43,589
all but there are also other really
interesting aspects of this

1030
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:46,320
for example all the model predicts

1031
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,969
that single-parent households will be

1032
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:54,619
the children of evade single-family
others single-parent households if it's

1033
00:48:54,619 --> 00:48:56,749
a real single-parent household

1034
00:48:56,749 --> 00:48:59,209
will be at a disadvantage

1035
00:48:59,209 --> 00:48:59,970
because

1036
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,779
in a traditional nuclear family
two-and-a-half

1037
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:04,699
okay

1038
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:08,930
so each newborn will have
correspondingly less

1039
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:13,099
affect on the intellectual resources
volvo of the family

1040
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:15,309
this is compensated for somewhat

1041
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:20,519
by at least in theory by the fact that
in lots of nominally single-parent

1042
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:23,169
households there are actually lots of
adults around

1043
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:27,569
there may be are across from her
boyfriend who's the who's involved in

1044
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:28,360
child care

1045
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,840
there are parents and grandparents are
involved in childcare the prediction of

1046
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,900
this model

1047
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:40,289
is that domain dulce there are around at
the child the better it is for the child

1048
00:49:40,289 --> 00:49:45,659
so of extended families with lots of
aunts and uncles and grandparents around

1049
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:48,739
are going to be better for the child's
intellectual development

1050
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:50,809
then vendor if they're not

1051
00:49:50,809 --> 00:49:53,029
but the point of all of this is

1052
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:55,220
that this is a confluence model

1053
00:49:55,220 --> 00:50:00,459
where everybody in the family is
contributing true

1054
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:05,119
this dream but they did the body of
intellectual resources in the family

1055
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:10,729
and everybody in the family is drawing
from that same body of intellectual

1056
00:50:10,729 --> 00:50:11,539
resources

1057
00:50:11,539 --> 00:50:13,899
as you moved into the family

1058
00:50:13,899 --> 00:50:19,189
growing up in the family move out of the
family your having an effect on the

1059
00:50:19,189 --> 00:50:21,450
environment within the family in such a
way

1060
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,950
that the environment is different for
each

1061
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:24,869
of the kids

1062
00:50:24,869 --> 00:50:31,869
quick question

1063
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:34,319
it's nineteen

1064
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,089
that's exactly right

1065
00:50:36,089 --> 00:50:36,719
phone

1066
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:38,249
so uh...

1067
00:50:38,249 --> 00:50:41,640
yes uh... the dave dave dealt with that
problem and on the other studies have

1068
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:46,269
also dealt with a prom so there isn't
any age con filed uh... here

1069
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:48,850
also again the idea here is

1070
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:53,099
that every child is part by professor
her open environment

1071
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:54,589
okay because that point

1072
00:50:54,589 --> 00:50:55,950
the rb four

1073
00:50:55,950 --> 00:51:00,140
this environment is constantly flatly in
the influx

1074
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,640
as people move into the environment as
people grow up in it as people move out

1075
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,269
the environment is constantly auto
changing

1076
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:12,960
each individual is influenced by this
constantly changing environment

1077
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,700
and each individual is contributing

1078
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,119
through the change that occurs autism
home

1079
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,410
in that environment

1080
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,239
in this way

1081
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,119
development isn't something that

1082
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:26,209
happens to the individual

1083
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:30,479
the important thing about that they did
important message about the republic's

1084
00:51:30,479 --> 00:51:30,960
model

1085
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,380
is a development

1086
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,019
doesn't just happened to the child

1087
00:51:35,019 --> 00:51:39,220
neighboring child isn't agent of his or
her own development

1088
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:39,700
contributing

1089
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,510
to what goes on and how he or she

1090
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:43,819
is going to come out

1091
00:51:43,819 --> 00:51:46,259
so i would just as each person

1092
00:51:46,259 --> 00:51:48,889
is part of his or her own environment

1093
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:51,029
each child

1094
00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:51,939
home

1095
00:51:51,939 --> 00:51:57,019
it is an influence on his or her own

1096
00:51:57,019 --> 00:51:57,779
that's it

1097
00:51:57,779 --> 00:52:01,459
have a good holiday come back monday
we'll talk about psychopathology in

1098
00:52:01,459 --> 00:52:02,599
psychotherapy

1099
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:03,029
thank you very much
