1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,120
okay let's continue our discussion of
the aisle biological basis of minded

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,599
behavior

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,260
first just another center

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,230
raksha lead more like a reminder

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,960
this is the first week of discussion
sections so you should be sure to attend

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,800
your discussion section

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,759
all of this week for people whose
discussion sections were on monday they

8
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:29,439
start next monday

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,449
if for any reason you can't go to your
discussion section this week contactor

10
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:36,519
geoscience they're wise you risk being

11
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:37,970
dropped from the course

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,680
if you're waitlisted for a discussion
section

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,670
we should go to the discussion section
for which your waitlisted if there's a

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,640
seat available

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,670
will do our best

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,430
to accommodate you

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:55,200
okay and the last lecture we began by
looking at the elementary and peripheral

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,000
parts of the nervous system

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,699
no runs

20
00:00:58,699 --> 00:00:59,660
nerves

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,670
hollow

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,720
feel more

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,230
or an article of the system is organized

24
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,880
how the somatic nervous system is
organized into the spinal nerves in the

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,860
cranial nerves and all of that

26
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,380
what we want to do today begin by train
attention to

27
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,400
the breath in the itself

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,370
this happens to be albert einstein's
brain all which was not studied after

29
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,159
wrong

30
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,780
product a red-eye

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,920
and at least on first appearance

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,630
the brain seems to be a single massive
oregon that sits on top of all of the

33
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,259
uh... of the spinal cord with some other
structures

34
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:41,060
located on your needs which all talk
about and not in a little while

35
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,630
art

36
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,530
on closer examination it's possible to

37
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,610
differentiate among various pieces all
of these three bro cortex

38
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,680
by virtue of a couple

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,520
couple of landmarks

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,930
first looking up at b

41
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,700
cortex

42
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,409
from the front

43
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,020
or from the top

44
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,280
you see that the brain is divided

45
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,860
into two hemispheres

46
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:12,649
by this also rivero commish or just
means

47
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,099
okay right there

48
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,550
you can see from the top

49
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,109
you can see it here from the uh... from
the front

50
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:22,539
which to run which divides the brain
into two hemispheres

51
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:27,649
what left and one right these
hemispheres are themselves

52
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:28,480
connected

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,970
by a bundle of nerve fibers

54
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,220
that are collectively known as the
corpus close them

55
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,140
and this bundle of nerve fibers

56
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,769
actually ball a lot i was the two
hemispheres

57
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:41,959
to communicate with each other capacity
for mation

58
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,190
or between

59
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,019
themselves

60
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,190
then looking from the side

61
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,400
we see couple of other all landmarks
here is where they

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,649
commish arenas bug running right down
the side

63
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:58,790
is what's known as the central fisher

64
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,209
are very large fold instru broke or text

65
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:03,590
you can see it here

66
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,060
and einstein's brain

67
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,409
there it is the most left hemisphere

68
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,560
there it is in the right hemisphere

69
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,660
which separates

70
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,830
two homes

71
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,220
the frontal lobe of the brain of circle
cortex

72
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,329
from the parietal lobe

73
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:20,380
and that there's what's known as the
lateral fisher

74
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,389
so-called because the runs

75
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:23,909
back-and-forth here

76
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:24,999
lateral fisher

77
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:26,459
you can see it here

78
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,120
and orenstein spraying and again

79
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,019
here and einstein's brain

80
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,279
all which separates

81
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,660
the frontal and parietal lobes

82
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,379
from the temporal lobes

83
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:38,410
of of the year of the brain

84
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,349
and then finally back here

85
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:42,299
square in the back

86
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,300
all of the brain is a fourth loeb

87
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,959
known as the occipital lobe the division
between the occipital lobe of the other

88
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:50,609
blobs

89
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:53,150
isn't quite as nicely d_-mark aid

90
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,639
as these others are there isn't anything
like

91
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,489
the central fisher or the lateral fisher

92
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,810
partnered and in no way

93
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,269
when polum

94
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:02,389
when you see it

95
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:04,249
okay so looking from the top

96
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:06,490
the brains divided two hemispheres

97
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:11,590
looking from the side the brains divided
into four lobes frontal lobe parietal

98
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,249
lobe

99
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:16,120
are temporal lobe and uh... and
occipital

100
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,619
these cerebral cortex is also sometimes
known as the neocortex

101
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:25,590
merely being the latin word for it no

102
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,240
and the reason for that is

103
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,340
that these dog this river cortex was the
last is the last structure in the

104
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,120
nervous system

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,490
to develop

106
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,639
and that's true

107
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,990
when if you construct consider
development

108
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,169
fire legit attic lian terms all of the
evolution of the species

109
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:45,650
the cerebral cortex emerged

110
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,990
relatively recently in evolutionary time

111
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,989
there are lots of animals that don't
have much or cerebral cortex

112
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:54,740
and it's also true

113
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,860
or that the cerebral cortex is neocortex

114
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,370
aren't o_j_ medically

115
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,610
in terms of the development of the
individual species member

116
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,309
it turns out that these three bro cortex
develops

117
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:08,520
relatively late

118
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,650
in the palm in fetal com fetal
development

119
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:17,319
here it is a diagram from sun taken from
scientific american american some years

120
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,590
ago

121
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,330
comparing

122
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,490
the palm

123
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,440
the uh... was triple cortex

124
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,130
in various species

125
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,540
here's a striped bass you can hardly see
yet leopard frog

126
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,430
the grass snake you can see a little bit
of it there

127
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,070
pigeon you can see a picketing

128
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,109
to emerge right there

129
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:36,740
the apostle

130
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,650
the cats

131
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,050
the mechanic monkey

132
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,690
the chimpanzee

133
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,389
and the human ok all one thing you
notice here is that

134
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,759
all cerebral cortex gets bigger as you
proceed from one species to the next but

135
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,669
that's not the important thing

136
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,580
the body also gets bigger

137
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,839
what's important is

138
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,449
all in humans and all other hominid all
or bob primate species

139
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,689
the proportion of brain mass devoted to
three book or text

140
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:09,989
is vastly larger

141
00:06:09,989 --> 00:06:11,000
then it is

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,460
four non primate non mammalian species

143
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,519
relatively little

144
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,939
brain messes devoted his to the cerebral

145
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:21,489
when you get to the mammals

146
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:23,150
an especially get to the primates

147
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,810
a lot of

148
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,509
ramos is devoted to cerebral cortex

149
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:28,970
so much so

150
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,189
that at in beyond bob primate

151
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:34,110
all let species

152
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,139
the brain

153
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,610
has to four they cannot itself

154
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,319
in order to get all that's ripple cortex

155
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,770
into a relatively small space

156
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,599
afforded by the along

157
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:46,810
by deal by the skull

158
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,860
these pictures are a little misleading

159
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,490
because the our brain really is and
decor as there is a really a bundle of

160
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,920
uh... neural tissue look kinda looks
like this

161
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,830
it's really more like a thin sheet of
neural tissues more like a bath towel

162
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,330
than anything else

163
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:01,870
paldon

164
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,449
done as per from brains were like that
also voters

165
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:06,530
all and

166
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,630
the in order to get inside the of the
osco case

167
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,310
it has to fold up on itself in his folds

168
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,710
are characteristic falls

169
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,439
lateral fisher

170
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,430
the central fisher and all these or
other

171
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,939
of forms and performances

172
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:23,590
okay so

173
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,370
viewed file a genetically

174
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:31,330
when you get to be species that have a
merge most recently in evolutionary time

175
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,009
on the whole lot of cerebral

176
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:35,389
uh... one zero cortex

177
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,819
and that's true aren't o_j_ medically to
you

178
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,490
in terms of the development of the
individual of fetus member

179
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,929
of this again from scientific american

180
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:47,969
all again this is the new world to move
all of a fetus twenty five days into

181
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,110
just station

182
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,520
and you really can't see

183
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,729
uh... any differentiating structures
role

184
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,430
thirty five days

185
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,469
some things beginning to happen there

186
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:59,580
forty days

187
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,680
into just a shit you can begin to see
the beginnings of the arm

188
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,940
triple cortex

189
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,930
fifty paise a hundred days is more than
three months

190
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,989
into pregnancy and that's what the
certain cortex looks like

191
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:13,110
five months

192
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,360
six months

193
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,070
seven months into just a shame notice
that the

194
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,419
cortex is getting so big now

195
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:20,939
at its beginning of

196
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:24,449
develop those characteristic fold so
could fit inside the skull case

197
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:25,270
eight months

198
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,340
and then nine months you see a pretty
pretty characteristic all human brain

199
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,609
with the lateral fisher very visible

200
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:34,420
and the

201
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,310
central fishing

202
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,849
or very visible again but this is
getting bigger

203
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:42,899
so it's not surprising that the brain is
getting bigger what's really interesting

204
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,920
here is that there is that as the fetus
develops

205
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,649
proportionately more of brain mass

206
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,339
is devoted to cerebral cortex

207
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:55,420
compared to other cartons on vocals
structures

208
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,570
it's a development

209
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,960
that's a bad storm

210
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,530
visible interim proportional terms

211
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,540
not uh... dot in

212
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,210
traditional brainless

213
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:06,799
alm

214
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,120
this is a specially

215
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,420
true when you consider

216
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,540
of a particular portion of these herbal
cortex

217
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,470
known as the prefrontal cortex

218
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,150
how something can be prefrontal isn't
completely clear that he'd frontera cuts

219
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,930
in front of the front right

220
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,920
all this is a frontal lobe here's the
cerebral

221
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,880
come ashore lateral fisher

222
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,170
frontal lobe here

223
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,820
portion on cerebral cortex

224
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,220
that's way to the front of the frontal
lobe

225
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,449
all you can see

226
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:38,930
that in the squirrel monkey the cat

227
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,200
the rhesus monkey the dog

228
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,300
there's relatively little prefrontal
cortex compared to the rest of the brain

229
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,790
but when you get to or closest primate o
relative the chimpanzee

230
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,560
and human

231
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,670
a huge amount or brain mass is devoted
to prefrontal cortex with implications

232
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,320
that will discuss in the couple of
minutes

233
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,800
so again palm

234
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,970
when you see this principle proportional
development

235
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,060
more proportionally more gray masses
devoted to cerebral cortex

236
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,420
in humans compared to what his species

237
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,070
and especially that's especially the
case

238
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,290
for so-called prefrontal or cortex

239
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,360
proportionally more of that

240
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
is devoted

241
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,140
to uh...

242
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,150
inhuman rather than other species

243
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,210
okay

244
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,590
now underneath

245
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,859
cerebral cortex

246
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:32,730
or some other structures that are
important

247
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,050
some of them are brainstem structures
others are so-called subcortical

248
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,959
structures

249
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:41,180
so here's the top of the spinal cord

250
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,730
and you can see

251
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,440
alm

252
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,639
structure known as the middle up

253
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,559
okay which controls vegetative functions

254
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,450
heartbeat on board uh... digestion
respiration things like that

255
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,630
we have the ponds here

256
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,350
which helps regulate cortical arousal

257
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,949
here's another structure

258
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:03,039
known as the uh... as the cerebellum

259
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,260
which is involved in coordinating alone
sensory uh... motor activity

260
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,110
and then

261
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,180
more beat up

262
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,720
further

263
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,200
off the brainstem

264
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,410
there's a strict structure known as the
fella miss which will talk about in a

265
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,140
minute

266
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,050
so you'd notice of the palaces appear
buried right underneath the cerebral

267
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,410
cortex

268
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,570
here's where the lateral fischer would
be

269
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,630
temporal lobe

270
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,070
frontal lobe frontal lobe looks at
applicable

271
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,630
there are these structures

272
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,649
like the thelma's that are nestled up
underneath

273
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,399
the cerebral cortex

274
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,150
and for that reason they're called are
subcortical structures

275
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,790
so here we have another division of the
brain

276
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,110
basically the hind brain

277
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,890
the midbrain and before brain

278
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,730
so-called

279
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,240
because in

280
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,459
most animals

281
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:56,109
quadro adalah or the quad repaired
animals

282
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:56,760
behind brain

283
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,330
is toward the back of the animal

284
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:04,000
and the forebrain is toward the front to
be on a more we walk operate

285
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,420
sofa ross behind brain is lol okay

286
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,510
and the forebrain

287
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,100
is hot but again if you read in

288
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,329
of literature on your oath lions you'll
see reference to

289
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:18,770
hind brain structures and four bring
structures in the brain structures

290
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,040
and you want to know

291
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,730
what that is all about okay

292
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,470
so downs on both a lot basics

293
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,200
features all of the anatomy albeit all
of the central nervous system the brain

294
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,370
and the brain stem

295
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,410
bottom-line doing more than anatomy here
this is a dog this isn't a biology

296
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,730
course this is a psychology course

297
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,550
what we what are known really

298
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,470
is how these various structures

299
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:50,460
how these various components all the
nervous system or related to or the mind

300
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,910
and behavior

301
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,150
water the psychological functions

302
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,070
or these different kinds of structures

303
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,690
all for example

304
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,060
taking a all very dramatic

305
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,439
all lots of mental function

306
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:06,610
known as a known as coldwell

307
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,670
or loss of consciousness

308
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,479
in which

309
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:13,480
the patient does not respond but all the
stimulation

310
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,820
shows no signs of a motion

311
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,360
bug the individuals vegetative functions
are okay

312
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,510
individuals in a coma

313
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,060
have lost consciousness

314
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,490
but their hearts still work they still
breathing still digest food and

315
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,510
eliminate food and all of that stuff

316
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,180
their eyes are closed

317
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,060
but they don't seem to go through the
normal cycles of sleep

318
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,960
that a person with an intact nervous
system uh... does

319
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,939
in

320
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:45,099
patience suffering komal comatose
patients you see the original one ought

321
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:47,550
to areas all of the brain

322
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,300
you're either a c our damage

323
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,740
the opera portion all of the brainstem

324
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,249
which includes a set of structures known
as the ritter killer formation

325
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:00,130
reticular formation because it kind of

326
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,320
falls back on itself

327
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,040
or that's the read part of the brain
stem

328
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,000
or the telomeres

329
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,590
here indicated in all blue

330
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,499
which has the function of

331
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:13,750
are dispersing sensory information

332
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,290
to various parts of the cortex

333
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,040
damage to these

334
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,779
areas one or the other

335
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:21,889
of these areas all of the brain

336
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,880
will lead to all loss of consciousness

337
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,449
these areas of the brain

338
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,100
seem to have

339
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,860
alarm among their functions

340
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,150
the hong

341
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,620
the presidential of normal alway keep
alertness and attentiveness

342
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,709
but when the damage is confined to these
areas you lose consciousness

343
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:42,779
but because there's no damage

344
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,320
down here in these brainstem structures

345
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,389
that mediate educator functions

346
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,250
the patient's vegetative functions will
be uh... okay

347
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,070
so when you look at

348
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,790
on

349
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,589
cases like call mark

350
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:59,849
persistent vegetative state and other
similar on your a logical us syndromes

351
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:01,180
you typically see

352
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,610
the uh... of the damage in these
locations

353
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,490
and the correlation

354
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,760
between structure and function

355
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,640
the fact that you lose consciousness

356
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,430
when you suffered damage to your review
particular formation or your phone list

357
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,220
it is an important clue as to the
function all of these particular

358
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,910
structures okay don't just sit there
directly doing something

359
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,639
more or less specific

360
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,340
and that is to say

361
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,160
but the function of these structures

362
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,430
is to regulate normal

363
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,510
waking

364
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,790
consciousness

365
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,740
what this illustrates is a general
principle

366
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,900
known as localization of function

367
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,319
the general idea behind

368
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,220
all localization of function

369
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,200
is that different parts all of the brain

370
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,819
are specialized

371
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:52,200
to serve

372
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,269
different

373
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:54,650
psychological functions

374
00:15:54,650 --> 00:16:00,090
now this is unrolled idea goes back to
the early part of the nineteenth century

375
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:04,350
all and a group of people known as
friend biologists

376
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,479
also pseudo science okay

377
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,029
but all in europe

378
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,519
fallen sports time

379
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,000
if united states on guide of actual
whole family trawlers in the slides ours

380
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,030
are promoted the idea but different
parts of the brain

381
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,410
were associated with different mental
functions

382
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,260
and all of the illustrated that all of
this all structure function correlation

383
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,240
with these so called from a logical
heads but you can sometimes find d_n_a_

384
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,120
antique shops

385
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,620
there are always fun

386
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,320
on somebody actually still makes these
poem so if you want to buy one on amazon

387
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,250
you probably him

388
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,920
yeah republican

389
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,790
but according to the front allah jazz
the brain was not simply a single lump

390
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,920
of neural tissue sitting on top of the
spinal cord

391
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,659
instead

392
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:56,699
the brain was composed of more or less
discrete mental oregon's

393
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,929
you chat with or discrete organs

394
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:05,709
each of which was associated with some
psychological alva function or faculty

395
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:06,329
on

396
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,250
in traditional fred a logical doctrine

397
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,830
there were about thirty five of these
faculties

398
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,500
and if you think about it for a second

399
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,789
they represent the kind of

400
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:20,939
common-sense organization mental life if
we sat down and took a poll instead

401
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,089
one of the things that

402
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:26,600
people do with their minds you'd come up
with a list that's not on like that i'll

403
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,959
defer knowledges

404
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,950
so they thought that there was a part of
the brain here

405
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,390
located on the near the bridge of the
nose

406
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,140
that was involved in the perception of
foreign

407
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,470
here's an area of the brain they thought
was involved in the perception of songs

408
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,960
here is all a part of the brain they
thought was associated with worth

409
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,530
fullness kind of a sense of humor

410
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,190
on truthfulness

411
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,740
musicality

412
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,050
are they had here is a part of the brain
they thought was associated with

413
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,020
cautiousness

414
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,900
and another one with friendship

415
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,960
and combativeness and destructiveness

416
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,580
amado this an interest in conjugal all
along

417
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,190
home o parental love to a different kind
of love self-esteem back here

418
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,610
benevolence veneration you've tried
these are the kinds of functions the for

419
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,400
knowledge us had in mind

420
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,109
and where they located them

421
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:18,200
uh... in the arm

422
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,310
in the brain

423
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,649
where they'd get this idea well what
gaulan spurred time would do

424
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:28,790
is a fine some four and that there's
some guy hanging around the club

425
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,350
that was particularly high in worth
fullness he was always laughing and

426
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,480
giggling ancient telling jokes and then
look at his skull

427
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,250
if they saw if they don't know if they
are going to fight a gun a bulge

428
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,020
someplace in a skull it's a opt

429
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,090
that's where it gets is worthless from

430
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,660
that must be where the homework fullness
area is

431
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,250
or if they found somebody was
particularly lacking in a sense of humor

432
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,220
baby again examiners gold maybe they'd
find a depression someplace and if there

433
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,590
are lucky doesn't have any brainware is
worth fullness area is

434
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,440
armed on so that the uh... that look at
it structured functionality

435
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,940
it was an incorrectly bad way to do
science arena everything's wrong without

436
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,070
a six year old panda

437
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,630
can identify the problems with this

438
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,370
fucked her for knowledge a kind of took
off as a uh... as a doctrine and it

439
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,440
turned out

440
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,700
that the for knowledge us

441
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,920
had the basic idea right

442
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,029
it turns out

443
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:29,010
that the cerebral cortex isn't just a
single massive oregon

444
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:34,070
it is composed of a bunch of discrete
centers each associate id

445
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,370
with some psychological function

446
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,320
but without the list of functions wrong

447
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,830
and i got the correlations will
structural rolling in every detail they

448
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,180
didn't get one right

449
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,760
are as far as we can tell

450
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,270
could they have except by accident given
the way they did

451
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,630
so the general idea behind for knology
which is the idea of

452
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,710
all localization function

453
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,710
allah is right

454
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,539
but the details of nineteenth century
from a logical doctrine

455
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,619
or or are quite long

456
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,549
how do we do it today well

457
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:10,409
we have a number of different ways
although studying structure function all

458
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,549
correlations

459
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:13,440
historically one of the most important

460
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,900
has been the study of patients with
brain lesions

461
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,549
that is

462
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:21,720
uh... patients who have suffered the
damage to some particular area of the

463
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,620
brain

464
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,050
and what we can do is weakened localize
where that lesion is what part of the

465
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,430
brains been damaged

466
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,149
and then

467
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:30,390
sc determine

468
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,890
what psychological functions on a day of
lost

469
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,249
usually these ovations come about by
accident

470
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:40,440
in the nineteenth century there the
religious study people with gunshot

471
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,960
wounds to the head quite a bit

472
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,520
home

473
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,020
oh and

474
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,560
occasionally as you'll see in a minute
there are surgical lesions to brain

475
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,259
tissue where

476
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:53,840
all the surgeons have deliberately
excellence on portion of brain tissue

477
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,400
all for other reasons now and then

478
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,930
observed the our correspondent loss of
function

479
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,299
on another technique that's used aud
used historically

480
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,730
is electrical stimulation of the brain
where u

481
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,940
remember that the brains of
electrochemical system of operates on

482
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,230
electrical principles

483
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,340
so what happens in the saudi in these
cases is

484
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,280
you put a microelectrode down into some
portion of the brain

485
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,049
and you run a very weak electrical
current

486
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,380
or through it

487
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,710
stimulating that portion brain and you
see what happens

488
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,610
so maybe you stimulate blood-brain the
person moves his left hand

489
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,350
you might think you could you repeat the
area of the controls movement or in the

490
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,480
left hand

491
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,200
though most recent development in the
all methods for for studied functional

492
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,330
specialization

493
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,350
or a variety of techniques that allow us
to image

494
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:54,350
the activity all of the brain in nora
logically intact living awake

495
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:55,840
subjects

496
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,539
so you can put or put a subject in

497
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:02,390
they own about or c_t_ a scatter

498
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,450
and look at

499
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,159
or the structure of the brain and
correlate that with function

500
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,800
or right online

501
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,400
you can use a technique known as
positron emission tomography pet

502
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,160
scanning

503
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,340
or magnetic resonance imaging apple
m_r_i_ on scanning

504
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,770
to actually absorb the

505
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,350
brain

506
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,990
working what parts of the brain or
active

507
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,799
as subjects perform various kinds of
tasks

508
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,120
not going to spend a lot of time on this
on notice quite a bit of detail on this

509
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,930
involved white man's text specially
chapter three

510
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,180
and there is some detail what it in the
lecture supplements for those of you who

511
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,240
are interested

512
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,169
i don't want to get caught up in the
various techniques

513
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:45,249
what i want to do is to give you a
little some flavor

514
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:48,900
or palm or all of this law localization
and function

515
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,560
bob whether it's through study of
patients with brain lesions

516
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,679
whether it's through electrical
stimulation

517
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:59,600
or electrical recording or whether it's
through these fancy or a new brain

518
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,970
imaging techniques

519
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,070
we're always looking in psychology

520
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,450
to correlate structure with function

521
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,250
what's going on in the brain

522
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,510
when people are engaged installed
particular form

523
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,800
of mental

524
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,050
activity

525
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,110
here is a classic

526
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,340
case in which

527
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,369
our brain lesions were used to infer

528
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:23,260
the all localization of certain on
psychological functions

529
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,550
this is the famous case of the patient
h_m_o_

530
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,290
who are suffered on young men about
eighteen years of age

531
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,120
who suffered from

532
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,610
very severe

533
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,909
intractable epileptic seizures these
were seizures

534
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:37,899
uh... that work

535
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:40,299
they were very frequent they were very
severe

536
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:43,580
they weren't controllable by anne

537
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,240
of the medications that were available
at the time

538
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,760
truly you solve a all recording
technique called the electoral

539
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,290
insufferable ram or the e_g_

540
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,840
are h_m_o_'s

541
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:00,110
physicians all localized these up
electric seizures as a reserach thing

542
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,260
from all of the temporal lobe

543
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,660
or in his own in his brain

544
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,710
far ahead as an act of desperation

545
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,870
they decided that they would article

546
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,990
pick out

547
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,179
some of that uh... those of the temporal
lobe

548
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:18,680
in an attempt to alleviate walden or his
old in seizures itself

549
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,330
radical piece in the rose surgery

550
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,369
uh... everybody said uh... well lots of
people said don't do this

551
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:27,740
uh... nobody know what these structures
dead at the time

552
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:32,809
they found out when all by another
h_m_o_ although woke up from that from

553
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:33,700
the surgery

554
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,420
was what the surgeon standard

555
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,739
was to remove

556
00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:41,210
the interior portion of the temporal or
all the time for world

557
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,150
member frontal

558
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,650
parietal occipital

559
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,410
temporal lobe

560
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,800
the interior portion of the temporal
lobe

561
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,280
including a subcortical structure known
as the uh... that as the hippocampus

562
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,730
and when a gem came out of the surgery

563
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:59,529
to some extent the operation was a
success he no longer suffered these same

564
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:04,259
kinds of epileptic seizures they
apparently had excised the area of the

565
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:06,820
hippocampus of the temporal lobe

566
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,990
that uh... or what where these seizures
were along with were being generated

567
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,740
h_m_o_ no longer had any memory

568
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,850
that is to say

569
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,409
he was not able to remember

570
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:21,360
anything that happened to him

571
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,160
since the time of the surgery

572
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,339
he was able it meant remember his pre
surgical life

573
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:30,420
fairly well there's some controversy
about that but mostly he was able ranbir

574
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,770
all preferred of his pre searchable life

575
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,820
post surgical life what the doctors
calls pols morbid all of the x

576
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,190
experience

577
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,550
was completely lost

578
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,390
too conscious recollection

579
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,919
this surgery was in nineteen fifty three

580
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,570
h m is still alive he's living in an
extended care facility and all

581
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,060
uh... in new england

582
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,210
and he has

583
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,290
no

584
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,320
conscious memory

585
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,539
or anything that has happened to him

586
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:01,080
of anything he's experienced anything
he's done on since the day

587
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,790
the operation

588
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,390
leading

589
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:09,419
people to suspect that start without no
that this structure the hippocampus

590
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:15,440
which is lodged inside the interior
portion of the temporal lobe is very

591
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,720
critical for laying down the memories in
such a way that you can get conscious

592
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,310
access to the later

593
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,620
the hippocampus isn't a storehouse of
memory

594
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,370
but the hippocampus seems the forum

595
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,770
a_t_r_ the to perform an important
function

596
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,090
in encoding and indexing memories

597
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,679
so that we could get at

598
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,100
them on the later

599
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,250
we know that from studies have been done

600
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,080
on patients and animals

601
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,790
since the agencies

602
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:47,749
art here as an instance where age and
lesion in in in a child's brain

603
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:49,519
led us to new insights

604
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:55,020
into the relationship between structure
and function question

605
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,900
yeah they took all of the quebec but
this whole shaded area here

606
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,339
the interior portion of the temporal
lobe

607
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:05,780
and including the hippocampus or the
middle of some other structures on here

608
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,360
they just went in and scope that out

609
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,220
you've got to remember that this was an
act of desperation on the part of

610
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,500
everybody's are a gem didn't want to
live with these seizures anymore

611
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,440
okay they were just don't parables
seizures

612
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,670
just really really really terrible

613
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:26,410
on there was no other way to control
them there was an act of desperation but

614
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,590
we don't do this surgery anymore right

615
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,320
are

616
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,740
but at the time

617
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,649
nobody knew

618
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:36,220
puncture the hippocampus was

619
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,879
nobody had any idea that it had any
particular function

620
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:42,419
if you think about it for a second he
said well it's there it's got to do

621
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,000
something

622
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,350
but nobody knew what it was

623
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,560
people generally thought that the member
orton mental functions were all were

624
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,710
performed by the cerebral cortex

625
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,740
also that you could take out some of
these subcortical areas and not do any

626
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,610
harm

627
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,090
we know better

628
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,870
naal but they didn't know that

629
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,260
yet he was quite a bit of his temple is
not the whole thing for reasons all talk

630
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,280
about the second

631
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,640
alm

632
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,690
yes you're looking for

633
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,480
all ok well there's a device called me a
lot of the electro in southlake around

634
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,870
that can you can attach electrodes to
the skull

635
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,009
and record

636
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:26,929
the electrical activity of the cortex
underneath

637
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:28,159
that electrode

638
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,940
there's just enough electrical activity
that you can kind of pickup

639
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,590
going to go through all we've got going
for this goal in the scalp so they put a

640
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,530
whole bonnet of these electrodes on a
gym

641
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,170
and waited for him to have a seizure

642
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,100
we don't know what are you going to know
that's how you do diagnosis right

643
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,999
they waited for about a seizure

644
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,510
and when

645
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,280
they've noticed and having a seizure

646
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,710
they noticed that the seizure activity
which is very clearly visible on the

647
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,840
g_o_p_'s

648
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,680
you recognize it immediately

649
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,599
began

650
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,029
in the temporal lobes

651
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,779
okay so that led them to think

652
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:06,370
correctly as it turned out that there
was something wrong

653
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,059
that portion of the temporal lobe

654
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:10,129
uh... that was causing

655
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:13,820
this seizure to be generated then spread
to other parts of the cortex

656
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,499
so if what part right

657
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:19,049
if the seizures starting out the
temporal lobe let's chop up some

658
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,780
temporal lobe

659
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,759
and we'll get rid of this

660
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,559
they were right

661
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,920
okay and you know

662
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,790
and we wouldn't do it again we wouldn't
do the surgery again

663
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,970
although they didn't know any better it
isn't that you have no idea how

664
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,580
primitive neural surgery was just fifty
or sixty years ago

665
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,889
uh... and uh...

666
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:41,940
on but the as i say that's one of these
great and desperate cores

667
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,200
uh... for a uh... condition that was
otherwise

668
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:52,200
not susceptible to any kind of treatment

669
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,860
all would be yelled with the amount of
damage they correlated with the amount

670
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,990
of uh... tissue took up

671
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,150
that's a general principle but it turns
out it's not the amount of tissue you

672
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:09,660
take out it's exactly what part of
tissue you take out

673
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,150
ald

674
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,030
here's the uh... here's the hippocampus
right in front of her as the amid the

675
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,080
low there's some other structures here

676
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,870
it's not yet the campus

677
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,060
if they had

678
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,409
take-out is temporal lobe

679
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:22,470
and left his hippocampus intact

680
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:27,620
he would have been free of a seizures
annie have his memory

681
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,460
that's very very very difficult to do
and given that surgical techniques of

682
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,240
the time

683
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,429
you can't really separate the
hippocampus from the left the propelled

684
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:36,710
the rest of the

685
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,020
them you do

686
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,360
new york portion of the temporal lobe
now without very very very very careful

687
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,919
surgery

688
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:45,040
all of a kind of the just born

689
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,190
alot to do

690
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,430
all thought so

691
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,770
all again if they are

692
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,679
just left at the campus alone

693
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:53,170
everything within hunky-dory

694
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,210
baat on they had to take the hippocampus
at the same time

695
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,419
they didn't know was going to cause a
problem

696
00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:00,010
let's look at it

697
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,550
but there are cases where people of lost

698
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,640
remember that there are two sides the
brain you got to have a camp life

699
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,970
one left one right

700
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,550
if you take out

701
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,149
alm

702
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:13,350
one hippocampus and not the other

703
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,860
you still have some memory function

704
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,909
bilateral resection

705
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,800
of the hippocampus

706
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,370
obliterates o conscious recollection
increases so the syndrome

707
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:24,840
home

708
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,540
yes one more question about

709
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,640
i'll get we're going to get to that in a
minute

710
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,679
alm and that's why they didn't take the
whole temporal lobe out

711
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,420
'cause that actually does some
interesting things

712
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:45,420
anything else on h m for a second

713
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,990
didn't do they do this procedure were
the ones not too many more times than

714
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:54,150
once

715
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,850
what they did mostly was monkeys

716
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,610
are not i wouldn't do this again fall

717
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,490
it takes a while forward to get out

718
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,150
okay

719
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:08,439
but this was the exam was such a unique
case okay

720
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:11,310
i don't think there's another case of
this

721
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,650
deliberately

722
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,760
on knowing searchable excited of
excision of the hippocampus on the

723
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,330
windward got out pretty fast you
shouldn't do this

724
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,170
and of course half the neuro surgeons in
the country said that this order all

725
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,450
your crazy don't do this

726
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,040
fathers and look we don't know

727
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,299
on and dog

728
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:29,990
you've got these singers

729
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,880
he doesn't want these features i think

730
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,590
age and gave informed consent

731
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,050
given the fact of what we knew about the
brain at the time

732
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,070
you've got a it's important not the kind
of

733
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,920
impose our current knowledge of the
brain on these guys

734
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,490
they just didn't know

735
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,390
and nobody quoted

736
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:54,419
that the hippocampus dysfunction one
more question that i gotta go on

737
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,320
yeah i'm not talking car no

738
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,000
he did not lose other functions in the
temporal lobe

739
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,250
for reasons all talk about the minute
okay if i don't answer that

740
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,380
ethnic yet

741
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,310
here is i talked a little bit about the
middle of before

742
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,410
although here's another patient at best
animal

743
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,360
although men who are

744
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,640
suffered calcification

745
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,330
fault

746
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,570
the armadillo

747
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,900
sits right in front of the head here's
the temporal lobe

748
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,670
here's the hippocampus buried in it and
right on the right on the the front

749
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,280
albeit at the capitol aka fender or
something there's a structure known as

750
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,620
you may do well

751
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,929
on this woman had a very very rare
recalled syndrome

752
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:39,250
known as bilateral calcification alva
mentor

753
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,840
and this is what happened is that the
amid the law

754
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,529
well it calcified returned to
essentially

755
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:49,240
bone tissue on dried up all and other
than dan turn to something very much

756
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,559
like or bone

757
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,450
and it affected only via made a lot

758
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,820
this son calcification did not extend
into the hippocampus

759
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,560
and it didn't extend anywhere else into
temporal lobe has a somewhat more

760
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,410
this law very rare in rural article
syndrome but you do see cases of it from

761
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,000
our time to time

762
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,010
and what happened in this case

763
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:13,810
is that patient s_m_ basically had no
cognitive impairments

764
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:19,139
she didn't suffer amnesia or the way a
gem did cursor hippocampus is undamaged

765
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,470
but she had problems again

766
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,879
promotional all-white

767
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,639
she had very difficult to share a lot of
difficulty experiencing negative

768
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,889
emotions especially emotion of fear

769
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:32,809
and she had buried on a lot of
difficulty recognizing all other

770
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:38,029
people's emotional states from their
facial expressions we recognize this on

771
00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:42,079
media lately as a person who is in a
state of fear

772
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:42,859
bypass them

773
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:45,419
neither experienced

774
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:47,799
on nor did she recognized fear

775
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:49,119
in others

776
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,629
and watch the same way

777
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:52,679
that weekend for

778
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,789
earth memory function all of the
hippocampus from what happened in cases

779
00:34:57,789 --> 00:34:59,259
like h m

780
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:03,160
we end for the young motion all
structure of the a mentor

781
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,309
from what happened

782
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:06,300
in cases like s_m_

783
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,349
it turns out

784
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:13,039
that the amid a lot plays a critical
role in regulating or a motion all lives

785
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:14,929
both the experience

786
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:16,400
and the expression

787
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,919
of emotion

788
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,620
particularly the negative emotions

789
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,139
and particularly the a motion of fear

790
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:25,289
so here we have

791
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,469
very good examples of how we can use
lesion evidence

792
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:31,359
to make inferences about

793
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,119
the functions on various alone

794
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:36,919
of various kinds of of structures

795
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:42,419
or questions about s_m_

796
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:45,150
now she doesn't experience negative
emotions

797
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,369
she does it hurt while she does it hurt
as much a motion role

798
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:52,030
all but she is specially is impaired in
terms of negative emotions

799
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,239
and especially in terms of fear

800
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,229
of the mitchell is sometimes of donors
of

801
00:35:58,229 --> 00:35:58,560
center

802
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,279
uh... in the brain yes

803
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:05,959
you know what autism have different sets
of problems are going to talk about that

804
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,709
a little bit later on

805
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:11,080
all but just think this is not autism
okay

806
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,470
and all autistic individuals don't have
particular problems with the amid dahil

807
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:21,490
on they have problems and experiencing
and expressing the motions sometimes but

808
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:24,949
that that's part of a path whole package
of other kinds of problems

809
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,779
that autistic people have

810
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:28,780
on to my knowledge anyway

811
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:34,090
all we've not been able yet to locate
any discrete brain damage that's

812
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:36,440
associates reliably associated with
autism

813
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,759
there's something wrong

814
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:40,220
in the brains of autistic people
presumably

815
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,689
but it's nothing like a discreet lesion

816
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:46,049
in the hippocampus or the amid dole or
anyplace else

817
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:53,049
one more question that i gotta go on

818
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,839
aslam dot that

819
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:05,489
since her memory was an apparent can't
you remember fearful experiences

820
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,379
bunny i got into that two ways

821
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:11,039
the first is that you can remember
fearful experiences that occurred to her

822
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,479
before her amid the leg dot calcified

823
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:18,390
all yeah i remember going up in this
tram once on a ski slope and i was

824
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,040
looking down i was really afraid i was
going to fall

825
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,619
she can remember that

826
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:26,789
she cannot reproduce that experience the
ways you can

827
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:29,339
if you were telling a story about the
time when you were afraid if should

828
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:30,920
begin to feel free to get

829
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,679
she doesn't have that

830
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:34,369
experience okay

831
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:35,270
second point

832
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:38,289
something will come that'll be more

833
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,909
understandable later on

834
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:44,279
sheet enter our choir deneuve fear
responses

835
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:45,189
okay

836
00:37:45,189 --> 00:37:47,599
but you can learn to fear

837
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,109
something

838
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:51,569
that she didn't fear before the damage
occurred

839
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:56,069
but she does experience fear now is that
you can learn about fear

840
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:58,299
watch you can do

841
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:01,509
is to recognize objects that

842
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:02,999
but on how to put it

843
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:08,099
she can recognize objects that sheet
ought to be afraid of

844
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:08,979
okay

845
00:38:08,979 --> 00:38:12,279
so you can show her a picture of a
rattlesnake if she had never seen a

846
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:15,809
rattlesnake in say look when you're hot
muck around in the desert staying away

847
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:18,190
from s

848
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:22,839
and she can learn that all ok i will
stay away from this

849
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:24,539
she doesn't have

850
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:26,459
but fear or

851
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:26,880
experience

852
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,369
that would go that that would be the
basis for most of our learning about

853
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:30,900
this

854
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,759
she can learn about

855
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:34,379
things to be avoided

856
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:36,589
things to be feared in the abstract

857
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:39,380
but these are not accompanied by any
experience

858
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,210
or fear

859
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,520
the amid door seems to be

860
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,500
important in generating that experience

861
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,799
when you made that was gone andy the
experience is gone

862
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:50,799
so there you go

863
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:54,440
two examples of how legion evidence can
be used

864
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,220
to infer aldy structure is a very
assault piece of the brain quick

865
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:06,210
question

866
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,900
what happens to the physical effects if
you're like sweating then dribble

867
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,369
dilation

868
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:13,660
they are generated by the amid deluxe

869
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,390
pyramid billet is gone

870
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,510
she doesn't have

871
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,359
those physiological

872
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:19,639
the fact that just

873
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,700
not part of her behavioral repertoire

874
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,800
any longer

875
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,549
precisely because

876
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:27,099
the amid all of the generates those

877
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:30,399
physiological all responses

878
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:31,580
turning attention

879
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,899
to the cortex itself

880
00:39:33,899 --> 00:39:37,859
on get back to blog a couple of other
questions here about special about the

881
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:40,900
temporal or the the temporal lobes

882
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,479
we can

883
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:46,220
get other evidence all of the structure
function relations

884
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,999
by looking at they unfortunately large
number of patients

885
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:55,319
who was stuffed with suffered from under
a logical syndrome known and stroke

886
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:59,429
strokes are basically heart attacks that
occur in the brain not enough

887
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:01,120
art there is a l

888
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,429
vascular insufficiency

889
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:06,419
an insufficient blood supply to the
brain lettuce and carrying the oxygen

890
00:40:06,419 --> 00:40:08,990
the brain needs to step to stay alive

891
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,390
and so certain our structures

892
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,400
or in the brain on died

893
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,820
this is all rough diagram of the

894
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,869
pasteur ization the brain and you can
see that there are these

895
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:22,890
big blood vessels that run up along the

896
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,619
of the central fisher

897
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:28,449
carry lots of blood to various parts of
of the brain

898
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:30,579
in people

899
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:32,450
suffer from a stroke

900
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,400
vascular insufficiency or an
insufficient

901
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,050
blood supply onto the brain there are
three

902
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,609
common symptoms

903
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:41,560
that we are that we observed

904
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,290
the first of these is paralysis

905
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,239
all laws all voluntary motor function

906
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,849
somebody down here in the last lecture
asked about hemi plea gel

907
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:55,069
handy please just something that happens
with strokes all loss of voluntary motor

908
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:56,049
function

909
00:40:56,049 --> 00:40:57,589
okay

910
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,320
anesthesia especially tactile anesthesia

911
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,019
all walks of tactile sensation in
various parts of the body

912
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:08,050
nother prime alcohol prominent symptom
of strokes

913
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,500
and then finally

914
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,930
on under logical set of symptoms known
as aphasia

915
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,479
are basically having to do

916
00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:16,840
with all laws of speech

917
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,759
and on dan dan and language functions

918
00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:21,249
and what happens now

919
00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:23,840
is that especially by virtue of

920
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,279
examining stroke patients and we are the
damage it

921
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:28,690
is occurring by virtue of

922
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,700
insufficient blood supply to the brain

923
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,089
weaken and for

924
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:34,409
additional aspects

925
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,140
structure function

926
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,589
uh... relations

927
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:37,990
so for example

928
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,749
we now know

929
00:41:39,749 --> 00:41:43,200
that they're is a portion all of the

930
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,389
frontal lobe

931
00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:48,219
just adjacent to the central fisher here
is the central fisher

932
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:49,559
your celebre fisher

933
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,029
frontal lobe parietal lobe

934
00:41:51,029 --> 00:41:53,190
there's a portion of all of the frontal
lobe

935
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,759
that is known as the primary motor area

936
00:41:56,759 --> 00:42:01,270
and this appears to be an area that
generates voluntary

937
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:07,649
motor behaviors of various kinds when
psalm or all all of this

938
00:42:07,649 --> 00:42:10,160
portion of the brain is damaged

939
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,799
five because no blood is getting to it
then you lose

940
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:17,299
uh... some voluntary motor function

941
00:42:17,299 --> 00:42:18,429
on me

942
00:42:18,429 --> 00:42:19,839
by the same token

943
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,180
there is a part of b parietal lobe

944
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,130
just adjacent

945
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:27,429
to the central of the fisher

946
00:42:27,429 --> 00:42:31,569
is called the primary the primaries some
out a sensory area

947
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:34,599
and there seems to be an area the
processes

948
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:36,290
tactile sensation

949
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:40,329
from various parts of the body the sense
of touch

950
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:42,269
damaging in this area

951
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,150
all will all be solved

952
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,810
in the loss of tactile sensation

953
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:47,699
in various

954
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:52,279
all parts of the body again we know this
primarily from stroke patients there's

955
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:53,750
other evidence as well

956
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,080
or that suggests that

957
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,299
here in the frontal lobe

958
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:00,929
a part of the cortex this devoted to

959
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:03,839
generated motor activities voluntary
motor activities

960
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,189
and we have a part of the pride elo

961
00:43:06,189 --> 00:43:07,630
that is devoted to

962
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,789
recvd

963
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:10,760
tactile sensations

964
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,089
from various parts of the bond

965
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:19,759
or in fact there's quite a bit of
interesting organization

966
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:21,430
both the all

967
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,869
frontal motor area

968
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:27,369
and a parietal samanta sensory area and
this could be illustrated by what's

969
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:29,810
known as the actually two structures

970
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,779
percent three a motor home uncles

971
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:34,550
comatose is just a little latin word
means little man

972
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,770
okays little man

973
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:37,660
uh... in the head

974
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:42,369
and don't wilder penfield the great
canadian on nor a surgeon

975
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:46,529
all views dog this as a way of
illustrating

976
00:43:46,529 --> 00:43:52,359
what parts are going on of the motor and
dull thoughts about a century arias

977
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:54,289
or associated with

978
00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:55,920
what functions so here

979
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,360
a magic now

980
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,519
that we've

981
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:03,129
sliced the brain down aka along the
armed

982
00:44:03,129 --> 00:44:04,540
along the central fisher

983
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,270
and we're now looking at it

984
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,589
from the inside

985
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:10,000
here is the cerebral commerce your

986
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,669
that divides the

987
00:44:11,669 --> 00:44:13,479
brain into two hemispheres

988
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:16,290
though inside this rubelcaba sir done
here

989
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,989
and then running and write down

990
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,659
the central

991
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:21,140
uh... here

992
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,569
into

993
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:23,679
ontario

994
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,959
doll it popped up next to the lateral
fisher which is what this is

995
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:29,440
in the frontal lobe

996
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,599
okay

997
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:32,080
what we have our

998
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,200
various areas all of the frontal lobe

999
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,420
that are

1000
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,719
dedicated to various parts of the body

1001
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:42,339
so here in the frontal lobe in these of
the area

1002
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:44,569
tucked in the end of the senate federal
fisher

1003
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:48,290
is apart of the frontal lobe the
controls the motions of the toes

1004
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,219
the feet

1005
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:54,299
the lower leg the operating

1006
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:56,390
the torso

1007
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,529
now were

1008
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:59,259
coming out

1009
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:01,210
the interior portion a brain

1010
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:05,809
down the side of the operable dove right
next to the central pressure

1011
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:09,150
part of the more motor cortex the
controls the operon arm

1012
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,000
lower arm

1013
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,829
the head

1014
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:14,689
the fingers

1015
00:45:14,689 --> 00:45:17,199
the bra leatherhead faith

1016
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:22,629
the job and here's a portion tucked up
under here aware the lateral fisher is

1017
00:45:22,629 --> 00:45:25,349
posted that controls swallowing behavior

1018
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:29,279
eat the motor activity of each different
part of the body

1019
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:33,109
seems to be associated is associated

1020
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:36,019
controlled by a different portion of the
frontal

1021
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:37,719
of the frontal lobe

1022
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:38,460
similarly

1023
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,410
with us about a sensory areas of the
priroda low there's a different part of

1024
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,180
the some out of sensory cortex

1025
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,799
associated with each individual part of
the body

1026
00:45:49,799 --> 00:45:55,829
so here talked into the all org of the
central connoisseur is a part of the

1027
00:45:55,829 --> 00:45:56,650
error that

1028
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:00,399
receives tactile sensation sensations
from the janet elliott

1029
00:46:00,399 --> 00:46:02,209
then the toes

1030
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:03,279
the feet

1031
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:04,569
the lower arm

1032
00:46:04,569 --> 00:46:06,659
the lower leg at the opera

1033
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:08,160
the torso

1034
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,900
now running down next to the central

1035
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,589
fisher in the primal world

1036
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:14,819
ya perot arm lower arm

1037
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:16,479
and fingers

1038
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:17,750
tactile sensations

1039
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,099
in the face

1040
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:21,809
the eyes the nose the faithful lips

1041
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:23,079
here in the teeth

1042
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:27,989
but all of the tongue parents and so on
talk to your under all of the lateral

1043
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:29,049
fisher

1044
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:29,600
notice

1045
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,990
two principles

1046
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:33,670
that we talked about when it came to the
spinal

1047
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:36,509
all of the today to the spinal nerves

1048
00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:41,119
first is a principle of regular
association

1049
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,800
apart of the frontal lobe

1050
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,180
that controls the movement of the
fingers is right next to the part of the

1051
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,289
frontal lobe the controls the movement
of the head

1052
00:46:50,289 --> 00:46:54,989
but part of the frontal lobe controls
the movement all the lower leg is right

1053
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:59,109
next to the park while before on frontal
lobe the controls the movement all of

1054
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:00,169
the

1055
00:47:00,169 --> 00:47:01,579
of the opera way

1056
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:04,420
similarly art and for the sinatra
sensory cortex

1057
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,620
on the primal side

1058
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,059
there is our regular association

1059
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:09,960
between the part of the body

1060
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,160
that's been moved or being sensed and
the part of the brain that's doing the

1061
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,459
movement or doing the sensing

1062
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,920
donor what the jury is should notice
here

1063
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,730
is again

1064
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,660
a feature all of

1065
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,680
proportional

1066
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,680
representation

1067
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,070
in the frontal lobe

1068
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:29,550
the amount of frontal motor cortex

1069
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:34,650
devoted to the various parts of the body
is proportional to the need of that body

1070
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:35,020
parts

1071
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,329
for fine motor control

1072
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:40,509
very fine motor control on your fingers

1073
00:47:40,509 --> 00:47:41,780
look at how much

1074
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,360
cortex is devoted

1075
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,409
do your head in your fingers

1076
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:46,170
compared to

1077
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:51,209
the trunk of your body which is by any
standard much larger

1078
00:47:51,209 --> 00:47:51,859
similarly

1079
00:47:51,859 --> 00:47:56,650
in the samanta sensory all area of the
pride elope

1080
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:01,079
proportionally more parietal cortex is
devoted to those body parts where you

1081
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:02,150
need

1082
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:02,949
fine

1083
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:04,950
tactile sensitivity

1084
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:05,450
again

1085
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,630
in their heads

1086
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,549
in the face palm

1087
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:10,249
on in the yard in the feet

1088
00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:12,539
where you want a lot of tactile
sensitivity

1089
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:14,519
you've got a lot of tissue

1090
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:16,299
devoted to that body part

1091
00:48:16,299 --> 00:48:18,949
though ads with the spinal nerves

1092
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:24,229
we see again this these two principles
of organization come into play

1093
00:48:24,229 --> 00:48:25,770
regular association

1094
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:26,719
between

1095
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:28,089
some part of the brain

1096
00:48:28,089 --> 00:48:30,579
and a part of the body that it serve

1097
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:32,589
and a proportional

1098
00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:33,170
association

1099
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:33,920
between

1100
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,420
some part of the brain

1101
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,039
and the body or that it serves

1102
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:40,039
two more things

1103
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:41,839
we also have

1104
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,399
here and at the time to roll over

1105
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:48,229
what's known as the primary auditory
aerial

1106
00:48:48,229 --> 00:48:51,410
the lateral portion temporal over to
looking outside

1107
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,469
from from the outside you know

1108
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:55,319
here's a look at a party temporal

1109
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:58,580
temporal cortex that's devoted to

1110
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,419
auditory processing to hearing and so on

1111
00:49:01,419 --> 00:49:03,489
and hear the very back

1112
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:07,489
of the occipital cortex is apart all of
the brain

1113
00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:10,369
that is devoted to visual processing

1114
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:12,749
when somebody experiences

1115
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:16,219
cortical deafness there are lots of
different kinds of deafness

1116
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,060
but cortical deafness

1117
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:22,589
typically involves damage to this
portion of the temporal lobe

1118
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:25,979
which is the primary auditory area

1119
00:49:25,979 --> 00:49:29,650
cortical blindness there are lots of
different ways to be blocking

1120
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,240
but cortical blindness

1121
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,999
in typically involves damage

1122
00:49:33,999 --> 00:49:36,579
this primary visual area

1123
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:38,169
the occipital lobe

1124
00:49:38,169 --> 00:49:39,359
so again

1125
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,529
we have

1126
00:49:40,529 --> 00:49:41,610
had this okay

1127
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:46,479
there lots of different visual areas as
well don't worry about that

1128
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:47,630
but basically

1129
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,069
what you've got here

1130
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:54,429
art illustrations all of the principle
of localization of function

1131
00:49:54,429 --> 00:49:58,219
motor function in the motors tripled our
frontal lobe

1132
00:49:58,219 --> 00:50:04,139
some add a sensory function in the some
at a sensory area of the parietal

1133
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:08,689
auditory processing in a piece of the
temporal lobe visual processing and

1134
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:11,359
appease of the occipital lobe

1135
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,529
something about memory in the
hippocampus something about a motion in

1136
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:19,679
the end that door that's the general
story behind localization of function

1137
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:21,929
will complete it on monday thank you
very much
