1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:13,040
okay let's finish up barnard discussion
of the biological basis of minded

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,949
behavior

3
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:16,359
with particular attention to

4
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,250
those structures of the brain and makes

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,369
thinking and everything else possible

6
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,779
last time i described it

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:25,920
for

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,679
examples of

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,439
so-called localization of function the
idea that particular mental and

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,340
behavioral functions

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:41,100
are associated with the war or performed
bari particular parts of the brain

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,940
and i reported out that

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,350
here in the frontal lobe

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,070
we have an area that's devoted to
voluntary motor behavior the controls

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,220
the movements

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,780
of the hands of the arms two legs the
feed the various parts of the body

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,760
here in parietal cortex

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,219
we have asked the so-called so meadows
sensory area

19
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,160
which receives

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,250
sensory impulses from various parts of
the body of specially the skin

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,260
the sense of touch

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,869
here in the temporal lobe

23
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:09,860
we have

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,610
what's known as the primary auditory
projection area

25
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,400
which receives

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,100
auditory messages from the ears

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,569
and then finally back here

28
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:24,160
we have the primary visual or cortex

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,390
which receives sensory messages

30
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,890
the audience

31
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,540
just in passing

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,469
want to point out that bizarre kind of
substructure here that's interesting

33
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,719
we've already talked a little bit about

34
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,649
differentiation of function within the

35
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:41,250
the all frontal motor cortex

36
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,150
and the perot idle some out of sensory
cortex

37
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,790
in terms of the

38
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,140
motor and sensory hormone kya list a
little man in the head that shows where

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,130
all these little areas are farm

40
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,930
located

41
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,009
but all again jata memorize this but you
should just know

42
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:00,280
that even within the occipital lobe

43
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,990
there is quite a bit of specialization
of function

44
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,840
sold-out we have a different areas of
visual cortex

45
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,879
that are devoted to things like the
processing of color information

46
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,149
the processing of movement information
and so on

47
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:19,689
you're not responsible for this and just
trying to show you how the thing is our

48
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:22,449
other thing is built

49
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:26,069
these study of stroke patients also
reveals

50
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,419
certain the areas of the brain that are
specialized for speech and language

51
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,780
we know this because

52
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,040
aphasia up

53
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,770
on a disruption of normal our speech and
language functions

54
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,640
is a very common

55
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,099
all

56
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:43,849
symptom

57
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:47,079
all other patients experience following
a stroke

58
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,879
all in but these are

59
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,480
though the symptoms of official
languages order vary greatly

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,909
there just be speech just flew in seas
were

61
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,669
the intended words just don't dollar
come out right or there's a lot of labor

62
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:01,089
to the speech

63
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:03,019
our problems with meaning

64
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,949
of phasic patients will have difficulty
repeating

65
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:09,569
words and phrases that are spoken to
them

66
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:14,059
they'll have difficulty understanding
spoken all words

67
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:18,809
they have difficulty naming objects and
sometimes they have difficulty with

68
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:21,839
reading and writing as well as with
speaking

69
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:25,549
but when we talk about a fishery usually
talking about

70
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:27,359
aquila problems

71
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:27,819
and

72
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:31,970
there ought to result in a wide variety
of different kinds of official

73
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,799
but the true that are of most interest
to us at this level of the cores

74
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,309

century of first body under all of this

78
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:56,720
in brokers aphasia the patient's speech

79
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,360
shows a lot of just flew in sees that
the patient is just not speaking

80
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,229
normally the way most of people do

81
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,109
but voted the best those speeches slow

82
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:10,459
its own grammatical

83
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,849
it's all a lady bird

home

85
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:18,109
it's inarticulate words don't quite come
out right words don't get fit together

86
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:20,120
in sentences quite p_r_

87
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,270
quite the way they should

88
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,139
however

89
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,779

of the speech of others is perfectly
fine

92
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:32,240
the persons having a difficult to
getting speech out

93
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,930
but isn't having any difficulty
understanding the speech of others so

94
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,169
that the person can respond to commands
and things like that perfectly on

95
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:41,889
normally

96
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,900
or they don't seem to have any of these
kinds of problems

97
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,840

on the other hand haitians weapon
verities aphasia

99
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,080
the so-called receptive aphasia

100
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,210
not only have problems with speech

101
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:55,720
production

102
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,360
or speech expression

103
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,130
but they also have problems

104
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:00,509
understanding

105
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,379
the speech

106
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,169
of other individuals they can't

107
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:07,350
follow our commander steak and follow
instructions

108
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,620
because they simply seem not to be able
to understand

109
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,319
what other people are saying to them

110
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,329
moreover

111
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:18,490
the patients with verities aphasia
so-called receptive aphasia

112
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,860
also have expressive problems

113
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,659
but they're expressing problems are
different from those that we observed

114
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,419
in so-called brokers aphasia

115
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:29,819
improper south asia

116
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,330
patients have a lot of difficulty
speaking but when they speak

117
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,360
their speech makes sense you can
understand what it's all about might be

118
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,699
hard but you can kind of get the meaning

119
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,649
that they're trying to convey that

120
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:44,669
by contrast in verities aphasia

121
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,500
the person speech may be very fluent in
some abstract sense all the words come

122
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,449
out final speech comes out fine but it
doesn't mean anything

123
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,959
all of the again there's a problem with

124
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,129
producing meeting

125
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:01,080
as well as understanding

126
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,930
the meaning

127
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,580
of the speech global of others

128
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,099
in either case there is no damage to his
corresponding skeletal musculature

129
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:13,419
the speech apparatus is fine for example
the hearing all

130
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:16,149
although title pathways are fine

131
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:19,970
clearly the difficulty reside somewhere
in the central nervous system

132
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,990
and we've known since the middle part of
the nineteenth century

133
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,199
that in fact

134
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,119
these two nd forums love aphasia these
two particular forums of language

135
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:31,719
dysfunction

136
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:37,569
are associated with damage to two
different parts of the brain

role 'cause aphasia

138
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,530

has difficulty speaking but the speech

139
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,539
makes

sold brokers aphasia and expressive
aphasia

148
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:12,679
is associated with damage in all areas
adjacent to the motor cortex

00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:15,949
by the same token although

150
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:18,970
barricades aphasia the so-called
receptive aphasia

151
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,500
where the patient has difficulty
conveying meaning

152
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,779
and has difficulty understanding the
speech of others

153
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:30,069
is associated with damage in an area
known as a very keys area

154
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:32,550
which is located in this region

155
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,050
mostly up here in the temporal lobe may
be extended a little bit

156
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,169
into the of

157
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:38,699

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,180
dysfunction all sometimes we think of
brokers area as a speech area

165
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,509
and we think are very diffuse area

166
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:57,580
ansel language area snot exact that's
not quite right but it's well it is

167
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,089
pretty close

168
00:07:59,089 --> 00:07:59,910
noticed

169
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,159
just off the

170
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:01,810
of

171
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,930
but to make the point

172
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,829
on notice where brokers area is ok it's
right down here

173
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:10,849
or very close to the lateral fisher

174
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:14,689
and if you remember or a little of among
killers

175
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:16,719
orval man in the head

176
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:18,710
and you look at that to be

177
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,540
motor

178
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,169
cortex here in the frontal lobe

179
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,710
you'll notice that the areas all of the
frontal all primary motor cortex that

180
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,160
control the movement of the face the
lips majeure and the tongue

181
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,090
right here again very very very close

182
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,509
to the

183
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:39,830
farther to the lateral fisher

184
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:46,090
so when you again look at

185
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:50,990
when you look at where broken syria is
trying to make sense

186
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,790
this is up with other various speech
that projects into

187
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,290
the po precisely

188
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:02,320
those portions of motor cortex their
control the speech apparatus okay so

189
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,110
damage here

190
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,110
no wonder

191
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,050
people have difficulty all

192
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,670
of people have difficulty speaking in
fact if you look at it of from a young

193
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,310
somewhat broader perspective

194
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,620
you can see

195
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,000
that speech

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,029
and language functions

197
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,550
actually requires

198
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,920
the coordination although i'm number of
different all of a number of different

199
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,840
centers

200
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,000
here are the pathways for example

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,949
that are involved in speaking

202
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:33,370
all word that is spoken to the patient

203
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:33,870
first

204
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:40,870
the word has to be that received by the
primary auditory area okay

205
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,750
the information is

206
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,500
transmitted to very dickey's area which
tries to understand

207
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,350
the all the above the word

208
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:50,910
then

209
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,090
the intention

210
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:57,830
to speak that word is transmitted to
brokers area which organizes

211
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,529
the speech at a breakfast

212
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:04,089
and then passes information to prime
absurd to though you know of those

213
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,599
portions of the primary motor cortex
that control the speech apparatus

214
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:11,920
so here we have one too

215
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,620
four different areas that our prod that
are involved

216
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,220
repeating

217
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,700
is

218
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,780
said

219
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,070
the patient

220
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,800
similarly

221
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,080
if you want to play of a person to speak
a written word

222
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,840
the visual input is first processed in
the primary visual area

223
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,020
then information is past to bear
dickey's area which involved which part

224
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:43,780
of the house at least in part the job of
understanding what's being the red

225
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,479
has to brokers area which organizes

226
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,650
the speech

227
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,180
and then

228
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,209
the appropriate areas of the motor
cortex

229
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,739
which actually executes

230
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:56,230
the speech act

231
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,419
different centers

232
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,380
show you art illustrate a point of going
to make a little bit later on

233
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,720
which is that it's not right to think
about the brain as a whole bunch of the

234
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,209
independent machines or organs

235
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:13,290
each going off on their own perform in a
row little functions

236
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,779
most complicated forms

237
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:20,090
of human thought an action require the
coordination

238
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,550
or the integration

239
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,270
all of a number of different bomb

240
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,389
of of a number of different of

241
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:27,799
all the brain areas

242
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,980
so again this is just an illustration

243
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,830
of how a number of different aerobraking
arrears

244
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,890
work together

245
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,230
the perform

246
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,820
even so simple

247
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,190
a

248
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,409
giza behavior

249
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:42,750
as repeating the spoken word

250
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,270
repeating

251
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,470
a written word

252
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,480
okay so now

253
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,990
we've got

254
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,160
brokers area

255
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,290
and verities area

256
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,060
added to the motor cortex the samanta
sensory cortex

257
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,290
the primary auditory area and the
primary artificial larry what's the rest

258
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,520
of the brain doing

259
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,550
welp for a long time

260
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,880
these all other areas of the brain the
best bulk of the frontal lobe

261
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,630
and the best bulk of the temporal
parietal and occipital lobes or simply

262
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,740
called association areas

263
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,419
and the general idea was that these very
large portions of the brain

264
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:29,899
had the function arg integrating sensory
input send amid per da performing memory

265
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:34,249
and out and thought process these all
kinds of prophesies are involved in

266
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:38,840
learning and memory and thinking that
language and uh... and so on

267
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,340
although there was uh... what at one
point

268
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,529
the idea that fault

269
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,019
maybe there was some specialization back
here

270
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,109
that the poster or your association
cortex

271
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:50,070
that is

272
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:55,540
though you association cortex of lies
behind the central fisher was basically

273
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,709
heretofore perceptual integration that
it would take tactile

274
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,030
an auditory

275
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,200
and visual information kind of put it
all together

276
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,189
whereas

277
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:06,389
the frontal

278
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:09,850
on association area that is the part
that lies in front

279
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,440
all of these of the central fisher

280
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,629
was basically involved with problem
solving

281
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,280
we've already seen

282
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,730
prefrontal cortex right up here

283
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,660
is something that is very very very well
developed

284
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,440
you

285
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,970
you know in humans

286
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,789
but the note the notion of association
area is a little bit misleading

287
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:33,210
because we know that all

288
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,769
the there are portions of so-called
association cortex

289
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:39,050
that are also dedicated

290
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:44,370
to a particular kinds all of our to
particular kinds of mental functions

291
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:44,850
palm

292
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,050
so for example

293
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,060
there are lots of different neurological
symptoms

294
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,199
that we can observe in associate all of
the resulting from brain damage

295
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:59,279
we've talked about amnesia the problem
of memory as in the case of patient

296
00:13:59,279 --> 00:13:59,930
h_m_o_

297
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,170
we've talked about of each other

298
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,890
speech problems as in brokers aphasia
and verities aphasia

299
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,030
but there

300
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:12,200
some patients after brain damage will
show they lexi i don't have difficulty

301
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,790
and redeem

302
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,710
a graph here they'll have difficulty in
writing

303
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,320
they calll julia they'll have difficult
e with them

304
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,420
arithmetic another mathematical
functions

305
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,230
they prac ceo where they'll have
difficulty engaging in various kinds of

306
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,939
actions

307
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:31,500
they can all understand what they're
being asked to do

308
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
but if you say to somebody

309
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
grabbed a pen

310
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,490
they can't seem to execute

311
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,050
that particular argue havier

312
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,770
orc barbados symptom known as acting
knows you know

313
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:48,140
which is a alm uh... lack of access to
various kinds of knowledge they can't

314
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:53,020
identify objects that are for military
ought to be familiar to them loans and

315
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,700
uh... and uh...

316
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,610
all identify what does what therefore

317
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,049
it turns out

318
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:03,380
that each all of these symptoms

319
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,260
more or less is associated without but

320
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:07,659
damage

321
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:11,040
to a different part of the brain

322
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,160
or these symptoms may arise from damage
to

323
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,829
a couple although

324
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:16,319
different

325
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:17,729
what particular

326
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:20,290
parts of of of the brain

327
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:20,920
suggesting

328
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,019
that there's a lot more going on and so
called association cortex

329
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:27,120
than simply formulas and ciation

330
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,330
that there's a lot more functional
specialization

331
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,470
in the brain

332
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,089
on than simply primary sensory areas

333
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:38,530
and of the various kinds of of language
areas

334
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,389
in fact no

335
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:43,610
we believe that there is so much

336
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,430
functional specialization in different
parts of the brain

337
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,430
that cognitive psychology in cognitive
neuroscience has adopted what might be

338
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,660
called doctrine of modularity

339
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,160
the idea that different

340
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,090
so-called hotter mental functions not
just elementary mental functions like

341
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,480
thinking about my god

342
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,310
on hearing and uh... and uh...

343
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,610
at the scene

344
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,970
different mental functions are served by
different so-called mental organs you

345
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,220
can think about

346
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,110
on the mind is being divided up into
specialized organs

347
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,019
and you can think of each of these

348
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,529
specialized mental organs

349
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:21,920
as associate id

350
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,230
with a different

351
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,450
the brain

352
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,620
all i think this is not the theory uvm
on their organization that was proposed

353
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,590
by

354
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,030
are jerry fodor painful loss of for
orble

355
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,630
of psychology alone linguist

356
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,770
uh... used to be at m_i_t_ now is that o

357
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,520
rutgers

358
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,850
and photo argued

359
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,880
that these modules these specialized
mental modules

360
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,170
had particular set of properties

361
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:50,860
first is

362
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,450
that they are domain-specific

363
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,720
which is to say

364
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,190
that each mental module

365
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,920
processes all the other certain class of
imports

366
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,990
for suggested

367
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,920
that there were modules dedicated to
processing

368
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,950
language

369
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,200
different module dedicated to processing
visual inputs

370
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,330
different module dedicated to auditory
perception like for the perception of

371
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,920
music or whatever

372
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,699
and then each of these modules would
provide an output

373
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:24,109
maybe to some kind of central executive

374
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:29,340
but the idea that there are a different
modules for different domains of

375
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,770
information processing

376
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,170
different modules for different domains
of human activities

377
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,470
our second of

378
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,970
of for government

379
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,620
of the second property bs mental modules

380
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,100
is that they are

381
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,700
what fodor called information only
encapsulated

382
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,010
which means they take all the what's
given to them by some kind of important

383
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,779
mechanism and there isn't any input

384
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,539
from other are domains

385
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:59,029
they're going to see an example of this
in our lectures on sensation and

386
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:00,280
perception

387
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,340
where all show you some visual allusions

388
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,350
where

389
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,880
things don't look the way they are

390
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,929
the visual perception is not an accurate
representation of reality

391
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:14,230
all

392
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,250
then when you know that

393
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,850
when you know this is the puns allusion
or this is the plugin dorf allusion

394
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,620
whatever you still see the allusion

395
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,429
knowing that you're seeing something
wrong

396
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:28,390
does incorrect status that's because
these visual allusions

397
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,120
are created

398
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,230
the activity of

399
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,920
dedicated mental magda modules that are
dedicated to visual processing

400
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,389
on knowledge from uh... residing
elsewhere in the system

401
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:41,160
can't get in

402
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,000
to affect

403
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,890
their operations

404
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,430
for third property of his mental modules

405
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,190
is that they are what folder called
hardware

406
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,510
and what he meant by that

407
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,200
these mental modules are not assembled
from more elementary functions

408
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,960
they are themselves the basic units of
psychological function

409
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,080
of soul

410
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,970
these kind of stand-alone and not in
that sense

411
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,960
all another property is that

412
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,379
at least hypothetically

413
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:13,740
they are innate

414
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,500
that is they call not with the organism

415
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,650
as part of its basic

416
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,310
information processing equipment

417
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,840
you don't lured to see visual loosens
the way you see them

418
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,330
it'll really learn to use language the
way you learned of use language you've

419
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,980
use of use language the way you do

420
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,580
because your brains of bill to do a leg
which

421
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,679
you see the world the way you do

422
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,610
because your brain is just built

423
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,490
innately to see the world

424
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,710
that way

425
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,919
on other property is that

426
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:46,259
these or mental modules operate
automatically

427
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,570
they can't help but do what they do

428
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,090
okay there's no

429
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,820
switch you conflict to turn them on or
off

430
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,519
or whatever they get an input

431
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:57,700
they do what they're supposed to do and
then creative output

432
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,800
for some other part of the system

433
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,700
and then finally

434
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,760
most important for our purposes

435
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,299
all photos suggested

436
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:07,240
that each of these mental modules

437
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,800
was associated with a fixed

438
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,240
no role

439
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,700
architecture

440
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,890
we need each of these mental modules was
associated

441
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:19,190
with a particular locus in the brain a
particular

442
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,669
piece of the brain

443
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:22,370
performed each one

444
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,760
of these functions

445
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,560
now this doctrine of mel of modularity

446
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,760
is no very very popular in psychology in
cognitive neuroscience and there's a lot

447
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,650
to it

448
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,540
all

449
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,150
on so it is the dominant view of brain
organization

450
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,290
these days

451
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,249
so that

452
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:43,009
youth can octopus is from the new york
times a couple of years ago with as good

453
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:46,370
an illustration on as as any of what's
going on

454
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,310
the result of

455
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,600
studies on

456
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,890
rain

457
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,279
behavior function

458
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,780
reveal hey

459
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,020
map all

460
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,840
specialization a function or a cerebral
local localization

461
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,179
has some of the features of the old for
knowledge us map but very very different

462
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:05,809
functions

463
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,929
off our located in very very different
areas just by comparison this is the old

464
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:13,210
for knowledge us map i discussed this
last time

465
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,290
wrong

466
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,210
here it is a doll

467
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,929
on some of you are functional
specialization

468
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:24,080
uh... as i've just a couple of years ago

469
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,480
is a part of the brain

470
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,330
that goes approximate mathematical
operations way ask you to guess what

471
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,460
twenty three times fifty eight is couple
thousand

472
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,840
that part of the brain

473
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,510
that the right right here is what
performs that there's another part of

474
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,920
the brain that's involved in the
anticipation of pain

475
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,620
here's another part of the brain

476
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,450
that's involved in all

477
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,460
all pleasant

478
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,970
our sense of touch

479
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,040
there is a part of the brain that
performs exact mathematical calculations

480
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,380
where you sit down sick

481
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,250
twenty three times before than ok
carried one ca

482
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,720
the five over all that stuff that you do

483
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,480
when you multiply

484
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,660
that is being apparently being performed
by a part of the prefrontal cortex or

485
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,760
right here

486
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,169
here is a part of the visual cortex
that's dedicated to the perception of

487
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:15,060
speed

488
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,269
there is another part of the visual
cortex

489
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,710
that's dedicated for the perception of
motion

490
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,739
here is a part of the

491
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:26,030
visual cortex actually right here in the
junction between

492
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,220
the art of the temporal lobe and the
private loeb

493
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,910
that's involved in face recognition

494
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:35,420
i want you to memorize all these
locations ok that's for another class

495
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,980
but what i do want you to get a sense of

496
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,600
is that now dubbed the brain

497
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,410
which we

498
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,260
wide once thought was justice huge

499
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,160
had a monolithic

500
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,690
oregon that sat on top of the spinal
cord

501
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,480
is now are really a collection

502
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,690
i've dedicated organs

503
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,399
organs each of which is dedicated to
performing a particular all particular

504
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:00,040
psychological function

505
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,710
and if you open

506
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,570
randomly

507
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,809
annie hall major scientific journal

508
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:08,169

509
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:10,570
bulb the brain cortex whatever

510
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,039
every month you'll see somebody
reporting

511
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,450
on what date one of the leaders the
discovery

512
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,540
of a new center in the brain

513
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,320
on is dedicated

514
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,179
particular

515
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:23,240
elemental

516
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,040
mental function

517
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,570
this is

518
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:30,509
the kind of thing that we're now
developing along the way

519
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,800
from an on differentiated piece of
tissue

520
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,590
the brain turns out to be ideal

521
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,910
integrated collection

522
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,399
of mental modules

523
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:41,169
each of which

524
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,730
is performing or particular

525
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,970
or the beginnings of a particular kind
of mental activity

526
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,370
where do

527
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,820
these mental models come from

528
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,890
well so far as we can figure out

529
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,070
they are apparently our product on the
evolution

530
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:03,330
usually we think about evolution as
operating on body morphology on the

531
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,850
appearance of the body

532
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,830
fish evolve fans

533
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,190
mammals evolve arms and legs

534
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,130
birds evolved wanes

535
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,020
darwin's finches evolve different kinds
of beacuse depending on the island in

536
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,760
the galapagos chain that they are live
on

537
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,950
but it turns out

538
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,190
that evolution

539
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,800
dosn't just shape

540
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,270
abad

541
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,040
evolution also shapes the brain

542
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,370
and evolution also shapes mind and
behavior

543
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,919
the general idea

544
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,990
is that these different specializations

545
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,790
on module that

546
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,179
process these the speed of motion

547
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:47,559
module the prophecies saw approximate
mathematical computations or whatever

548
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,610
these constituted

549
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,810
a kind of mental toolbox

550
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,450
all which all allocated are adaptation

551
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,799
on union but i wanted to give our

552
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,950
as we were

553
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,850
splitting off

554
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,410
frome or from our hominid ancestors

555
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,750
and especially

556
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,340
that poem

557
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,040
diesel

558
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,720
these are particular mental structures
immersed in what yeh pollution every

559
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,360
psychologists call

560
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,590
the environment of early adaptation that
is the environment where humans first

561
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,040
began to emerge

562
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,160
in the east african savannah song

563
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,290
following beginning about ah...

564
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,610
almost two almost two million years ago

565
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,299
so that's the general idea behind

566
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:31,500
functional specialization

567
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,930
modularity of the mind

568
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:35,100
of mine consisting of a

569
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,880
toolbox

570
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,820
of specialized implements if you will
each of which

571
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,570
has been shaved by evolution

572
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:47,530
and that's what that's as far as saw
that that's all good as far as i can go

573
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,950
but if you think about it for a second

574
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,660
there have to be some limitations on
module or

575
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,350
you thought the idea that they

576
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,760
rain is just off

577
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,100
toolbox of specialized tools

578
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,080
tent the before story

579
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,120
off for one thing

580
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,440
the brain isn't joyous a collection of
independent pieces

581
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,480
fault called the dedicated

582
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,440
to any particular function

583
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,330
the first thing we want to do

584
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,610
is to

585
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,870
distinguish between

586
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,710
psychological functions

587
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,470
various kinds of operations of the mine
and the contents

588
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,390
onto onto which these operations are
applauding

589
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:34,990
mental functions mathematical
computations perceiving speed perceiving

590
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,660
motion all those kinds of things

591
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,899
may very well

592
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:41,769
the localized may be performed by
particular

593
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:43,350
pieces of the brain

594
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,559
but as far as we can tell

595
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,390
mental contents

596
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,700
what you are thinking about when you
think

597
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,020
what you perceive when you see something

598
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,490
the precise thing that you remember when
you remember some of that in your past

599
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,940
those do not appear

600
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,850
to be on a localized

601
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,380
on knowledge of particular things

602
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,630
particular wallet of memories of past
events

603
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,610
they appear to be distributed widely

604
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,129
over

605
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:18,340
the over the cerebral cortex also that
they're not on particular memories like

606
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,659
what you had for dinner last thursday or
what your grandmother told you i hear

607
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:28,470
that your high school graduation those
memories are not localized in particular

608
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,810
bundles of your runs

609
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,039
those memories

610
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,299
are represented as a

611
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,020
pattern of neural activity

612
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,690
that is distributed

613
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,330
widely

614
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,160
over the cortex

615
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,750
so the first limitation

616
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:46,410
on the doctrine of modularity is at the
doctor modularity may apply to functions

617
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,690
but it doesn't seem to apply to content

618
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,410
it may apply to

619
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,290
how you think but it doesn't necessarily
apply

620
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,700
you think about

621
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,440
the second limitation

622
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,430
under doctrinal modularity

623
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,160
dog illustrated earlier

624
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,130
and that is that there is an a counter

625
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,470
posed doctrine of whole ism

626
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,799
which is to say

627
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,040
that in the ordinary course of everyday
living

628
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,169
or experienced block an action

629
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:16,809
is mediated by

630
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:18,539
the integrated

631
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:23,240
and coordinated activity of a number of
different modules

632
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,130
think about that example that we used
before

633
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,899
speaking are written word

634
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:30,670
or speaking

635
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,850
spoken word

636
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,420
there's not by speaking the spoken word
module in the brain

637
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,749
some piece of the brain that just does
that it doesn't do anything else rather

638
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:43,840
even that very simple

639
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,760
peace love behavior is mediated by the
coordinated and integrated actions

640
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,330
at least four

641
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:52,870
different

642
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,959
mental modules

643
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:58,079
one that's involved in hearing or that's
involved in understanding when it's

644
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:00,040
involved in organizing speech

645
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,420
and one that's involved

646
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,330
in executing

647
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,650
so again

648
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,359
all along

649
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:10,190
there had uh... there's that kind of
limitation on on modularity

650
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,890
based third limitation on modularity

651
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:20,320
compounds in the forearm of what onto
neuroscientist called equal potentiality

652
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,820
the adult brain maybe a highly
specialized

653
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,009
but the image for a brain

654
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:29,019
seems to have

655
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,919
all lot more

656
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:33,040
on

657
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,140
ability

658
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,440
carry out different functions in
different parts of the brain

659
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,950
there is what we call all plasticity

660
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,600
in brain development

661
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,630
and we know there is for example

662
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,470
bar because children

663
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,530
may have suffered a stroke a little kids
can suffer strokes

664
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,120
that doesn't happen very often but it
does happen

665
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,420
but it's a staffer who suffer strokes

666
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:02,890
can recover language function much
better than adults who suffer

667
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:08,080
and apparently this is because there are
on number of different centers in the

668
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,600
brain

669
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,859
that can perform various coverage
language functions

670
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:13,930
and if you destroy one

671
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,679
early and often development

672
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,769
there's the possibility that some
quarter doll of module

673
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:21,059
can take over

674
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:26,299
that all of that function folk early in
development several different areas

675
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:30,700
seemed to be capable of carrying out
particular functions

676
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,559
functional specialization

677
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,669
appears to get fixed

678
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:36,770
as the brain mature words

679
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,890
and the brain brain doesn't

680
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:42,010
finished developing until well after
birth well into

681
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,429
all of the teenage years or outdoor

682
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:45,519
at least

683
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,600
on which point

684
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,710
the brain loses some degree of
plasticity

685
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,019
so that if you're an adult

686
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:54,090
is suffer brain damage you may lose some
function

687
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,629
and you may have a lot of difficulty
recovering

688
00:30:56,629 --> 00:30:58,760
from that function

689
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,230
even in the case of adults

690
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,360
there is some possibility

691
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,960
all recovery

692
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,070
volvo function

693
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,580
or get nine use the example the other
day

694
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,230
of senator thames considered north
dakota

695
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,020
who suffered a massive brain hemorrhage

696
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,730
lost his speech function all lost
basically his old uh...

697
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,479
along function on the right side of his
body

698
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:25,120
what's known as the right place penny
please you

699
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,289
over the last eight nine months

700
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:31,770
johnson has recovered are great deal of
his speech function

701
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,700
he's never going to be william jennings
bryan on the senate floor as he himself

702
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,190
admits

703
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:41,870
his speech is pretty good if you heard
of the other day or on the news when you

704
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,580
returned to uh... when you return to the
senate

705
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,090
all and that suggests

706
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,570
that even in the adult brain

707
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,200
there is some degree all redone dancing

708
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,190
though that

709
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,510
at least under some conditions

710
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,960
buffer damage to some part of the brain

711
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,520
function performed by that part of the
brain is not necessarilly irretrievably

712
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,060
lost because

713
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,340
some other part of the brain

714
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,240
the ability

715
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,709
may have the ability to take over that
function

716
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:16,929
may not perform it small hall

717
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:18,080
perfectly

718
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,820
will do

719
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,110
so again

720
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:26,600
once you understand that but doctor
demodulator is the only dean

721
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,670
or understanding of

722
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:34,110
all how brain behavior relations mind
brain relations or or or organized

723
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,200
but modularity is not the whole story

724
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,619
there are various kinds of limits

725
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:41,419
on modularity

726
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:44,239
another reason to doubt an extreme
burgeoning

727
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:46,230
all the doctoral modularity

728
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,159
is that human beings

729
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,940
didn't stay in the environment of early

730
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,350
adaptation

731
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,620
human species even worse than the
african savannah

732
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,970
saw hundred eighty thousand years ago

733
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,950
all but very quickly

734
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,230
all we began to move out

735
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,359
of this event

736
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,409
to all other environments

737
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:08,900
out to ourself a show

738
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,680
and australia

739
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,240
into

740
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,140
the middle east and east asia

741
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,280
opted to europe

742
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,220
and then over the land bridge

743
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,039
into north

744
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,039
and south america

745
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:20,940
ads

746
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,570
humans migrated to these new parts of
the planet

747
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,430
we moved into

748
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,880
adi very different environments

749
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,000
the environment all relief

750
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,450
on adaptation

751
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,440
and now of course we're living in

752
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,650
incredibly different environment fears

753
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,309
got station at the south pole

754
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:43,760
the international a space station

755
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,900
where we have human beings living in a
more or less permanently

756
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,840
environments that are as different

757
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,260
from the environment

758
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,660
overly adaptation

759
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,420
as night is fall from day

760
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,940
the very fact

761
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:03,309
that we have that were able to survive
the way we survive in

762
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:04,540
italy

763
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,940
and norway

764
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,500
and iceland

765
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,859
as well as on the african savannah

766
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:14,260
must be attributable to the fact that
we've got more than simply

767
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,640
'em toolbox

768
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,050
that evolved to help us to meet the
demands

769
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,199
of the environment of early adaptation

770
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,649
on in addition

771
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:26,299
box of dedicated mental tools

772
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:28,789
we also must have

773
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:29,820
something like

774
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,019
general intelligence

775
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:33,659
general

776
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,329
problem solving capacity

777
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:37,219
of general capacity to

778
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,429
uh... meat

779
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:40,619
unsolved

780
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:41,820
no problems

781
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,590
that are opposed to us

782
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,470
by the new environments

783
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,820
in too rich

784
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,509
we are what we you know we've moved

785
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:51,520
and we also have to have

786
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,809
a capacity for learning

787
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:58,839
we can't rely simply on innate

788
00:34:58,839 --> 00:34:59,920
mental modules

789
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,579
in order to get along

790
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:05,269
in order to survive in new environments

791
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,749
in order to adapt

792
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:10,089
the environments that we encounter to us

793
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:13,470
we have to be able to acquire

794
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,350
knowledge and we do that

795
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,319
by virtue

796
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:18,549
process that we're going to do

797
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:23,840
all discuss next time or puller team by
which we can acquire

798
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,039
new knowledge

799
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:28,669
experience

800
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:32,379
okay before i do anything else any
questions about drug adoption of

801
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:36,250
modularity and functional specialization
and all of that

802
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:43,250
anything at all

803
00:35:54,569 --> 00:36:00,039
is there any kind of hierarchy about dog
the organization these modules

804
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:02,419
well you'd think there would be

805
00:36:02,419 --> 00:36:03,459
okay

806
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:06,839
but so far dot appears not to a bit of

807
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,569
function but they are dot topic of much
research

808
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:11,770
what dot

809
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:16,009
sarkar neuropsychology and cognitive
neurosciences been after

810
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:17,660
mostly these days

811
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,119
has been to identify what these modules
are and what they do

812
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:27,650
the general idea behind of the general
method in cognitive neuroscience

813
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,190
put somebody in sale

814
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:34,260
i'm alright machine and watch their
brain well they perform some particular

815
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,079
function in hopes of identifying

816
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,329
particular part of the brain that does
is that ok

817
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:43,099
follow

818
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:47,909
assemblyman all of these modules into
what kind of hierarchical organization

819
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:50,919
yet there has to be something like that

820
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:54,599
but there hasn't been that much
attention paid to that workers nation

821
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:55,740
level i think that's

822
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,210
that's worked that really has to be done
all in the future

823
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,650
got an answer

824
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:08,650
okay yes

825
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:13,280
yeah well the idea is that these modules

826
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,900
evolved

827
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,479
in the environment

828
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:16,949
overly adaptation

829
00:37:16,949 --> 00:37:21,429
and it's the same way that our physical
features evolved in that environment

830
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:23,549
helping us to survive in that
environment

831
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:25,949
the ideas that our mental

832
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:29,000
features also evolved in that
environment

833
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,749
the helpless survived in that particular
environment

834
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:33,470
and uh...

835
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,050
you if you read in evolutionary
psychology

836
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,389
you will sometimes c_r_

837
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,839
of there is very much

838
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,469
well certain kinds of mistakes we make
amid talk about some of these in the

839
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,109
lectures on what language

840
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:49,609
and the reason we make them is because
our brains evolved in a particular

841
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:53,549
environment and now we're different and
barman that we still are using these

842
00:37:53,549 --> 00:37:55,549
holdover

843
00:37:55,549 --> 00:37:56,880
farm

844
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,619
these modules did evolve early on

845
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:02,309
think about the modules for speech and
language

846
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:03,369
for example

847
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:06,110
have to be bold very very very early

848
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,260
on the environment of early adaptation

849
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,519
but the point is worried oliveira
anymore

850
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:16,509
or at least not all of us who live there
anymore and the fact that we can live in

851
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:20,630
norway and icelanders number space for
them and parked the car and uh...

852
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,649
uh... and other places other that
environment

853
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:25,599
must mean

854
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,949
there's something else going out

855
00:38:27,949 --> 00:38:31,220
and what that the other thing is i think
is forrest

856
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,519
not only not only got

857
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,930
last set of specialised mental tools

858
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,980
but we have

859
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,809
general intelligence we have a general
problem solving ability that we can use

860
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:43,870
to attack

861
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,920
new problems

862
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,460
that we encounter

863
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,170
and not only do we have

864
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,979
innately specified mental toolbox

865
00:38:50,979 --> 00:38:53,099
as the doctor modular he says

866
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,599
we also appear to have

867
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,299
the capacity to learn new things

868
00:38:57,299 --> 00:38:58,189
things that

869
00:38:58,189 --> 00:38:59,439
uh...

870
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:01,149
nobody knew anything about

871
00:39:01,149 --> 00:39:05,150
in the place to see nora the african
savannah

872
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,159
like how to drive a standard shift kar

873
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:16,159
contemplative you had a question

874
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:29,209
look at your brain that's hard to find
memory questions where did we find

875
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:30,809
memory

876
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:33,969
particular memories of what you had for
dinner last thursday tonight or what

877
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:37,619
your grandmother said he had high school
graduation or whatever

878
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:40,269
they don't appear to be located in
discrete

879
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:42,670
bundles of neurons the ways say

880
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,449
there's a broker's area

881
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:45,670
that those speech

882
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,450
or a very dickey's area that dollars on
language we know that got time to do

883
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,179
this

884
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:54,979
all we know that based on the some orkut
classic work

885
00:39:54,979 --> 00:39:59,450
by a psychologist at harvard university
named karol lash elite

886
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,679
back in the nineteen th

887
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,310
and what do you actually did

888
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,989
the very

889
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:09,329
as not to the squeamish but they'd be
experiment was a very simple

890
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:10,259
straightforward sperm

891
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:12,319
you would take laboratory animals

892
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,859
these were caps

893
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:15,849
and he'd

894
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:19,759
they'd be naive cats they're just kind
of raised a laboratory that had never

895
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:23,569
had much opportunity word anything any
teach them something

896
00:40:23,569 --> 00:40:25,330
you'd teach them how to

897
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,959
open a door to get out of a cage recoton
hot oppressive bardo

898
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:32,099
to uh... get food reputed to run a maze
or something like that

899
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,929
and that's all we teach them

900
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:38,369
and he had the idea

901
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:43,170
are very and on the lesion methodist
study he might be able to find where a

902
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:46,439
dot piece of learning was located in the
brain

903
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:51,029
but what he did was after he taught the
animals to perform this task

904
00:40:51,029 --> 00:40:53,670
he then

905
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,179
lesion

906
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:55,339
their brain

907
00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:56,919
he would take out

908
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:59,449
various parts of the three bo cortex

909
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:00,509
refer moments

910
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:02,519
in various areas

911
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:03,589
and then

912
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:04,630
let them he'll

913
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,149
and then retest them

914
00:41:06,149 --> 00:41:08,599
to see if they could still perform the
task

915
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,929
and what lastly discovered

916
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:13,399
was that

917
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:14,629
loss of function

918
00:41:14,629 --> 00:41:16,660
loss of ability to perform the task

919
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,270
was correlated with the amongst

920
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,829
partition that he removed from the brain

921
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:24,150
but it wasn't correlated

922
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,099
any particular locus

923
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:29,479
though it's not as if

924
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:33,869
if he took out the parietal lobe the
animals lost with a lower

925
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:35,630
or people got a frontal

926
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:38,139
you have a whole lost what they were

927
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:40,150
the amount of tissue

928
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,419
but not the precise location

929
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:44,200
at that level actually

930
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,629
to home

931
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:50,249
to formulate what he called for wall of
mass action

932
00:41:50,249 --> 00:41:54,249
wallmaster sounds like something to do
with a political demonstration right

933
00:41:54,249 --> 00:41:58,519
all but what the law of mass action
basically meant was

934
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,179
in learning

935
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:02,989
use your all cortex

936
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:07,109
that learning is stored in the cortex is
a whole

937
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:07,790
clearly

938
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,959
there was

939
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:12,040
the animals had to navigate visually
through the maze

940
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,090
and so you

941
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:17,130
visuals of though the visual area of the
occipital cortex would be important

942
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:20,419
what as long as he stared at spirits
mother cortex

943
00:42:20,419 --> 00:42:23,339
they've been to be able to form
particularly well

944
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:26,339
and that led him to conclude

945
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:27,069
particulars

946
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:30,799
as we know

947
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,490
localized in particular parts of the
brain

948
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,989
rather

949
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:38,409
followed represented in the brain as a
whole

950
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:39,549
that's the idea

951
00:42:39,549 --> 00:42:42,959
are those of you who are interested in
engineering you know a whole wanna hola

952
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:44,469
graham is

953
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:48,309
lessig annoyed about hola grams or more
more recent invention

954
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:51,390
a hologram as though they deserve
representation or you can take a lot a

955
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:55,229
lot out of it you can still preserve the
information in the representations

956
00:42:55,229 --> 00:42:58,260
and he thought that all of the brain
kind of function

957
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:58,909
like that

958
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:05,909
had a question here

959
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,209
there are broke at the idea of what does
is what's needed to have to do with

960
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:15,299
broken verity

961
00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:18,360
the ideas that brokers area

962
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,420
evolved to manage speech

963
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,849
and verities area evolved to manage
language

964
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:26,939
and if you go back to

965
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:29,949
real modular

966
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:31,559
map here

967
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:35,950
general ideas that you'd send these
dedicated areas of brain

968
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,719
evolved in such a way is to perform that
function

969
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:40,269
and your main point is

970
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:42,669
that there's got to be more too

971
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:44,339
rain than that

972
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:45,029
because

973
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:47,869
we can do things other than these things

974
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:51,119
weekend all address the demands of
environments or other than the one in

975
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,360
which we wold

976
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,520
there's really been no evolutionary
changed in humans than

977
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,410
adam and eve couple a jeans here in
there

978
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,279
all but we are very different

979
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:04,029
from the people of five six

980
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:05,569
thousand years ago

981
00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:11,640
and those differences calm by virtue of
the fact that we have

982
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,959
general intelligence not just to do a
bunch of dedicated tools

983
00:44:16,959 --> 00:44:18,400
the ability to learn

984
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,169
were not relying simply on uni

985
00:44:24,169 --> 00:44:31,169
anything else but that yet

986
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:38,219
well the general idea is that at some
point

987
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:42,809
somewhere along the somewhere in
adolescence

988
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:47,590
terrain becomes more or less fixed and
its architectural and then it's

989
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:51,099
very difficult

990
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:52,909
some kind of recovery function

991
00:44:52,909 --> 00:44:55,729
but it's not impossible again the main

992
00:44:55,729 --> 00:44:57,340
senator johnson

993
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,779
lost his speech functions

994
00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:02,170
all you they were just god

995
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,160
on that part of it that that part of his
cortex is

996
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,709
pretty much

997
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:10,799
but he can speak okay

998
00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:12,010
also this kind of these

999
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,420
there's gotta be some possibility now
that

1000
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,840
what exactly what it is isn't completely
clear remember

1001
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,749
but the speech and language functions

1002
00:45:19,749 --> 00:45:23,499
tend to be localized to the left
hemisphere

1003
00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:24,840
there's a reason for thinking

1004
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,550
that there isn't there a read on dan
structures in the right hemisphere

1005
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,039
everytime usually use

1006
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:34,529
and that maybe they can take over some
of these functions if the left

1007
00:45:34,529 --> 00:45:35,530
hemispheres structures

1008
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,269
or loss

1009
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:38,479
moreover

1010
00:45:38,479 --> 00:45:43,549
in neuroscience there used to be a
doctrine that said there's no

1011
00:45:43,549 --> 00:45:44,300
recovery

1012
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,249
from central nervous system damage has
settled

1013
00:45:47,249 --> 00:45:49,809
but one of the system damages forever

1014
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:55,009
we now know that there is some
possibility of urogenital

1015
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:55,700
in

1016
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,859
central nervous system tissue

1017
00:45:58,859 --> 00:45:59,580
damage

1018
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,939
peripheral nerve tissue

1019
00:46:00,939 --> 00:46:02,439
that repairs itself

1020
00:46:02,439 --> 00:46:06,299
if you damage central nervous system
tissue the general idea it's been that

1021
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:08,599
that's gone forever

1022
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,170
now again you don't want to push this to
watch don't go up riding a motorcycle

1023
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:16,700
without a helmet tonight because there's
no real genesis okay

1024
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,909
but apparently

1025
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:23,890
the brain the spinal cord haves some
capacity to repair themselves

1026
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,559
very very very

1027
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,690
restricted

1028
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:28,299
conditions

1029
00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:31,749
though there are lots of reasons for
good another reason for recovery

1030
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:32,680
function is that

1031
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,479
but damage may be severe but not
complete

1032
00:46:36,479 --> 00:46:38,339
but there's just enough

1033
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:39,329
tissue left over

1034
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:44,999
to be able to perform function of psalm
allotment and some level

1035
00:46:44,999 --> 00:46:46,199
again

1036
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:47,030
there is

1037
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:50,589
the ability to recover some functions

1038
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:53,049
the younger you are when you have the
damage

1039
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:54,850
the more likely you workin

1040
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:59,769
who want to experience that kind of
recovery

1041
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:06,769
anything else we got a couple of minutes
here

1042
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,029
a confidentiality

1043
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:14,549
what interest between our
confidentiality and recovery of function

1044
00:47:14,549 --> 00:47:20,210
ekkuva tension elderly really refers to
the fact that the image or brain

1045
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:25,969
is not rigidly special is not yet
rigidly specialize

1046
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:30,849
and because the image or brain is not
rigidly specialized

1047
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,339
there's more ability

1048
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:36,339
or an image or brain to recover function

1049
00:47:36,339 --> 00:47:40,849
than for a much more bring to recover
function because they mature brain

1050
00:47:40,849 --> 00:47:42,880
not be rigidly specialized yet

1051
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,619
maybe some other park and take over the
function of what otherwise your loss

1052
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:51,249
that general idea

1053
00:47:51,249 --> 00:47:55,009
okay tax time will take up prostheses of
learning

1054
00:47:55,009 --> 00:47:55,989
thank you very much

1055
00:47:55,989 --> 00:47:56,519
see you wednesday
