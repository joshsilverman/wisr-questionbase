1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,980
okay here we are now we're going to
tranfer attention away from

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,320
basic cognitive processes like
perception and memory and thinking

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,550
and begin to put all this material
together

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,369
in anyhow

5
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,370
somewhat higher level discussion

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,350
all of the individual behavior in

7
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,710
his or her social world

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,670
and let's begin just be just by
reminding ourselves also

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,140
through fundamental facts about human
nature

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,100
the first that we've emphasized in the
first part of the scores

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,380
is that

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:47,140
human beings in their behavior are
intelligent creatures

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,070
we're not just operating by virtue of
love

14
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,900
innate

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,850
stimulus response connections like
reflexes and tax season instincts

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,220
our behavior isn't just a product of
classical instrumental conditioning

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,500
that stance in various responses to
environmental stimuli

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,400
rather

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,850
throughout our behavior reflects our
attempts to make sense of the world

20
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,280
around us

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,690
what frederick bartlett cold effort
after meaning

22
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,659
the learning we're trying to figure out

23
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:22,830
what's happening what's votes

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,600
predicting what what's going to happen
next one of the consequences of our

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,470
behaviors

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,070
in perception we're trying to figure out
what it is that's out there and where

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,260
it's going

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,590
in memory we're trying to figure out
what it was that happened at some point

29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,890
in the past

30
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,409
all of that reflects effort after
meeting

31
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,710
it's also the case

32
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,659
we're not just intelligent creatures
were intelligent social creatures

33
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:54,110
all of our individual experience thought
and action

34
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,350
take place in an environment that's
followed by other people

35
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,280
and our

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,409
everyday interactions with other people

37
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,439
arbor ogle guided by various processes
have to do with cooperation and

38
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,410
competition

39
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,819
and all the other things that we can do
with each other

40
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,979
that raises the fundamental question for
psychology as a social science

41
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,049
which is

42
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:19,689
what's the relationship

43
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:23,659
between what's going on inside the head
of the individual

44
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:26,569
what he or she is thinking and feeling

45
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:27,839
and one thing

46
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:33,409
and what's going on in the social world
outside the individual what's going on

47
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:34,629
in the

48
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:39,180
all in the lives of other people that
have some kind of a fact

49
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,999
on what's going on uh... on the
individual

50
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:47,999
the classic framework for thinking about
these things was given to us by late

51
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:51,159
german emigres psychologist about doll

52
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,659
seventy years ago now kurt lewin that's
his picture

53
00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:00,129
armed ended comes in the form a kind of
singer mathematics all formula

54
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,890
where learning to do that

55
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,760
the individuals' behavior

56
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,519
as a function of to kinds of
determinants

57
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,959
personal determines

58
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,080
fire which lumen meant

59
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,379
states and dispositions there were some
hollywood internal to the person

60
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,920
what the person fat or believed or felt
or wanted

61
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,349
these things that are going on inside
the individuals had

62
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,310
and on the other hand

63
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,399
determines that lady in the environment
of private side of the individual

64
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:33,239
whether it's the physical environment

65
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,090
how amazing it is how hard it is what
the air pressure is whether it's raining

66
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,390
or these social environment

67
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,260
whether there are other people around
what they're doing what they're feeling

68
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,119
but they're wanting and so on

69
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,569
but the general framework remember

70
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,809
psychology always interested in
explaining that the behavior all of the

71
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:59,199
individual organism and we want argued
that that individuals' behavior was a

72
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,890
function of

73
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,519
these two types of determines personal
determines

74
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,699
and environmental determines

75
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:10,899
the branch of psychology known as a
personality psychology

76
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:17,049
have traditionally focused its attention
on the personal determinants of behavior

77
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,959
that is to think about behavior

78
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,199
as a function of things that are going
on inside the individual

79
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,789
and personality psychology generally
construe is

80
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:31,599
these internal determinants or personal
determines the behavior

81
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,130
in various ways

82
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,050
as people's beliefs

83
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,549
okay

84
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:39,789
i believe that it's monday therefore
writing

85
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:42,569
come to class this liked each other new
mondays

86
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:44,590
all up attitudes

87
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,430
volume

88
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,090
fault the likes to teach more or less

89
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,380
on mondays

90
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,690
also like on the class and teach all
trades i have all certain

91
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,180
level of some kind of trait that makes
me do what i do

92
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:04,130
emotions motives or whatever it is these
are all construed as somehow internal to

93
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,020
me

94
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,599
that will lead me to behave the way i do
know and on the other hand

95
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,410
but deal with in traditional personal
reflexology

96
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,120
is that situational factors or largely
irrelevant

97
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,749
okay the probe the primary determinants

98
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:21,449
of the individuals behavior

99
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:23,970
have to do with these individual traits

100
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,610
side of the traditional method

101
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,270
charging for personalities like orgies

102
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,530
is to

103
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,680
assessed people's level

104
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,120
also i'm trait like friendliness

105
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,550
and then you use those assessments

106
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,099
to protect their behavior

107
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:42,989
on simon trait relevant dimension

108
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:44,730
so we'd expect that

109
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:49,560
friendly people would smile more than a
man friendly people friend friendly

110
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,610
people or it kind of people kinds of
people who smile

111
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,649
so what we do here is reclassify group
of subjects into those who were high and

112
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,470
friendliness

113
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,460
and those were lowered friendliness

114
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,540
and we observed

115
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,130
the probability that there'll be smiling
at any particular moment some of your

116
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,150
smiling now so i'll be or not

117
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,759
in this song

118
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,630
this method

119
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:16,060
we would want to relate that of behavior
to your level of friendliness that's the

120
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,300
general logic behind

121
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,550
traditional personality psychology

122
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,069
here is the real world example this is
data collected by berkeley's professor

123
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:27,270
all over john's some years ago

124
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,990
this is study of m_b_a_ students up
publicly on a business school bihar

125
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,909
school of business

126
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:36,669
and left our john and his colleagues did

127
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,510
was to administered a personality
questionnaire

128
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,970
that with all that you heard our trade
known as conscientious

129
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,550
in these individuals

130
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,069
also some people were harlem
conscientious this there are very

131
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:53,809
conscientious very responsible very
dedicated

132
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:57,589
and others were kind of low
unconsciousness they were going for

133
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,990
slackers of various kinds

134
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,990
and then what all of god dot john did

135
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,830
all blows to accor range for the start
of the individuals these m_b_a_ students

136
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,910
fish are now at proper to cover time

137
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,289
for end of the for an appointment and he
simply measured

138
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:17,860
there are a little time for the
appointment that they arrive on time

139
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,020
that they are rivals or did they are
ripe early and what you can see here

140
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,400
is that individuals who were

141
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,059
measured as haryana strata conscientious
this

142
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:32,889
tended to arrive a little bit early for
their appointments about thirty seconds

143
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,110
early but still early on the further
appointments

144
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,310
whereas individuals who are low in
consciousness

145
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,979
tended to arrive late further
appointments

146
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:43,960
all more than five minutes late

147
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,520
on average so here we have sam trade

148
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,250
some disposition that is somehow
internal to the person

149
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,700
his or her level of conscientious miss

150
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,280
at then predicts

151
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,119
all-white solved what what he or she is
going to do

152
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:01,209
in some specific situation

153
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,410
generalizing from this

154
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:07,270
are we have alva with a big difference
of all in the psychology of personality

155
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,289
comes to us from gordon all port

156
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,819
a psychologist who worked for many years
at harvard

157
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,150
aldrich of

158
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,669
so that's called the doctrine of trades

159
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:19,170
and the document rates basically says

160
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,939
that the individuals behavior individual
behavior

161
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,570
varies as a function

162
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,400
also internal dispositions that's what
rates are there internal behavioral

163
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,529
dispositions

164
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,879
that renderer behavior

165
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,940
coherent

166
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,169
stable

167
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:35,819
consistent

168
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:37,490
and predictable at all

169
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,630
the flight and give examples of each of
these four charms

170
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,950
are as we go on so behavior varies as a
function

171
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,839
of internal dispositions

172
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,820
that render behavior

173
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,130
coherent stable consistent and
predictable and again these internal

174
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:52,890
dispositions

175
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,949
common wide variety of forms

176
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:58,000
but most research on the document traits

177
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,910
as either

178
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,389
ought to do with

179
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:04,790
personality traits like conscientious
nose sore extra version or friendliness

180
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,580
or something like that

181
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:07,980
attitudes

182
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,410
for example all liberal versus
conservative political attitudes or pro

183
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,730
feminist or empty feminist gender
attitudes or whatever

184
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,829
so that we could

185
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:21,369
uh... flowing from the doctrine of
trades

186
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:24,930
is what we might call the cutout i call
it a typical method

187
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,010
for personality research which is to
measure some personality variable

188
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,060
whichever one you are interested in
conscientious ness might be one

189
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,310
and we consider that the predictor
variables these measurements can come

190
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,780
from self-report questionnaires

191
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,920
or rating scales of the sort that many
of you filled out

192
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,279
altering the calm

193
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,470
pre screening

194
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,520
far beyond increase screening packet for
the are ppr experience

195
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,670
or they could come from general
behavioral observations instead of

196
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,500
having you filled out a questionnaire

197
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,850
we could go to your parents

198
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,240
or your siblings

199
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,660
or your roommates or your sorority
sisters or it's some body

200
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,010
who knows you well

201
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,140
and have become already one of these
various dimensions like conscientious

202
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,580
nis and that's what we do is we take
these individual differences across a

203
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,759
big group of people

204
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,330
and then correlate these individual
differences in some trade

205
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,640
with individual differences in behavior
in some specific situations

206
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,040
the assessment of personality

207
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,600
constitutes a predictor variable

208
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,060
we're trying to predict

209
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,560
how people will be haven

210
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,479
on some kind of criterium

211
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,740
variable

212
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,910
that method is to be contrasted

213
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,460
with the method in traditional social
psychology

214
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,279
which focuses not on personal
determinants of behavior

215
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:45,890
but rather odd environmental
determinants of behavior

216
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,309
here we have been women's terms

217
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:51,700
behavior as a function all of the
environment

218
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,839
and traditional personality psychology

219
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,210
will try to on assessed sam aspect of
the environment

220
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,080
whether it's the physical environment
house stuff it is in a room

221
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,170
or whether it's the social environment

222
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,089
how many people are in the room

223
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:08,960
and then alm volatile

224
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,410
try to predict behavior from that

225
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,090
consists construing personal factors

226
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,340
like the kinds of factors that the
doctrine of traits is concerned with as

227
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,899
largely irrelevant

228
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:22,440
so to return to war smiling example

229
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,310
we might observe whether somebody's
smiling

230
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,500
when they're in a situation with a close
acquaintance

231
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,750
or whether they're in a situation with a
stranger and we might observe that

232
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,150
people are more likely to smile when
they were in the presence of somebody

233
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,240
they know

234
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,370
then they will that then they are when
they were in the presence of somebody

235
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,490
they don't know

236
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,259
here is the situational factor got
nothing to do with a person

237
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:49,210
got nothin with their level of
friendliness or anything else

238
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,629
we've got some situational variable

239
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:52,509
that predicts

240
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:54,720
the likelihood that somebody

241
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,110
will smile unit

242
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,959
professor janet colleagues

243
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,530
looked at situational influences on
punctuality as well

244
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,350
all again for these cities are quickly
m_b_a_ students

245
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,050
and what are john all of the dead

246
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,579
was too

247
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,360
art has some stones some students
arriving

248
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,400
for an appointment to the scheduled in
the morning

249
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,140
or other students arriving for
appointment that was scheduled in the

250
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,060
afternoon and any of you who have had a
morning appointment know what happens

251
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,930
rapids

252
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,759
all here

253
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,670
we have students

254
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,790
all who have an appointment time in the
morning

255
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,500
and they tend to arrive late

256
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,450
for those appointments by about five and
a half minutes on average

257
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:43,060
students who have an appointment in the
afternoon they tend to arrive a little

258
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,660
early amend it more to early

259
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,939
here again we're treating personality
variables is completely irrelevant

260
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:53,249
and were simply looking at the effect on
behavior

261
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:57,679
whether somebody is punctual are not as
a function of the situation whether

262
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,000
they're appointment is for the morning
or

263
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,960
afternoon

264
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,030
so again

265
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,090
contrast into the doctrine of trades we
have what might be called the doctrine

266
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,840
of situation is on all up which is often

267
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,160
generally vulva associated with another
harvard psychologist b_f_ skinner

268
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,459
all portend skinner were at harvard at
the same time

269
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:27,059
the animosity between all port with his
doctrine of trade since kidder with his

270
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:28,519
doctrine of situations

271
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,600
was sold

272
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,110
fears

273
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,519
but they are said to break up the
harvard psychology department and put

274
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,680
the all poor people on one floor of the
skin or people on another floor

275
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,690
all about

276
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:45,430
whereas argued that the havier though it
is a function of trades scare argued

277
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,680
that behavior goes is a function of the
external environment okay

278
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,410
although

279
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,820
all of those so much so that start the
skaters quite famous for the salt for

280
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,109
the school at the ground

281
00:13:57,109 --> 00:14:02,550
or person does not act upon the world
rather the world accident on him

282
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,540
and reactions in the situation skinner
was all learning theorists he was on

283
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,320
steve's old stimulus response
behaviorist of the first order and he

284
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,350
viewed although all behavior as
essentially all of them out matter of

285
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,540
conditioned responses

286
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,590
to dog to environmental variables

287
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,460
so we had the doctrine of trades

288
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,870
we have the doctrine of situations that

289
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,790
basically comes from skinner

290
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,140
and the doctor the situation is a man

291
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,470
gives us the kind that i call or
traditional method

292
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,140
four research and social psychology

293
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,110
which is that we manipulates on the

294
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,440
feature of the external environment
whether the appointment is for the

295
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,309
morning or the afternoon

296
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:46,819
whether there are other people in the
room or not whether there were a claim

297
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,160
missus or strangers or not

298
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,969
okay

299
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:54,399
we've got the port subjects in these
various embarked on environmental

300
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,029
conditions

301
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:59,029
and then we determine the effect of this
environmental manipulation

302
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,190
on their behavior

303
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,630
in some specific

304
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,740
on situation

305
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,899
in the language of psychological methods
the manipulated a feature of the

306
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:12,130
external environment is known as the
independent variable it's something that

307
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,380
is manipulated by the experimenter

308
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,270
and the

309
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:20,149
all behavior is known as the deep end in
variable that is

310
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:23,019
we want to see whether the behavior
varies

311
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:26,610
depending on the level all the alle

312
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:31,100
on on the level of the independent
variable

313
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,750
here

314
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,730
flowinfreely mullins equation behavior
as a function of the personnel and the

315
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,330
environment

316
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:42,030
we see the all the evolution the
emergence of true great traditions

317
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:47,189
within personality and social psychology
traditional personality psychology

318
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:52,380
focusing on personal determines the
behavior and calm or

319
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,810
social psychology

320
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,060
focusing on the environmental
determinants of behavior

321
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,819
now of course

322
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:01,250
he could have it both ways if you want

323
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,359
the usual assumption in psychology

324
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,380
has been

325
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,500
that these personal and environmental
factors or independent of each other

326
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,210
okay you can have kind of off eclectic
position

327
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,499
okay there are a person personal
variables like trades

328
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:20,160
that influence howell person will behave

329
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,839
so

330
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,310
your level of friendliness

331
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,950
will determine whether you smile or not

332
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,760
and they're all features on the
environment

333
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,689
white whether your looking at a
acquaintance or a stranger

334
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:34,820
devil determine whether you smile or not

335
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,309
but if you'll notice

336
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:37,860
these two

337
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,630
cole pathways if you will

338
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,990
are entirely independent of each other

339
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,480
there's appraisal determined at the
behavior and it's got nothing to do with

340
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,650
the environmental determines the
behavior there's no connection between

341
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,200
them

342
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,640
there's an environmental determinants of
behavior but it's got nothing to do with

343
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,949
the personal all of the determinant or
for

344
00:16:57,949 --> 00:16:59,060
of behavior

345
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,940
while you can see this

346
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,740
graphically

347
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,809
this is a graphic display of the kind of
outcome you'd expect

348
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:09,899
if the personal and the environmental
determinants of behavior

349
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:12,059
work independent of each other

350
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,420
here we have

351
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,929
on two levels of friendliness

352
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:18,920
hi friendliness and well friendliness

353
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,540
and we have to

354
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,560
all very all levels of the situation

355
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,889
with an acquaintance

356
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:26,409
and with a stranger

357
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:29,429
and you can see in this graph i know
this is soooo delegated i don't know

358
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:32,690
what's conducted this experiment or
chili or experiment like this in a

359
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,370
second

360
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,559
the behavior as predicted by

361
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,580
of the level personality trait

362
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,520
people who are high and friendliness

363
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,710
tend to smile more than people who were
low and friendliness

364
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,700
no over behaviors affected by the
situation

365
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,270
people gore facing an acquaintance

366
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:55,460
are more likely to smile than people who
are facing all stranger

367
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,889
but notice that these affects our
independent of each other

368
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:01,310
these lines are parallel

369
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,730
it doesn't matter whether you're facing
the mcfarlane acquaintance

370
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,490
or you're facing a stranger

371
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:11,800
if you're high-end friendliness you're
more likely to smile than if you're not

372
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,580
and it doesn't matter

373
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,100
whether you're a friendly person or an
auden friendly person

374
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,110
if you're in the presence of an
acquaintance

375
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:24,310
you're more likely to smile that you're
not these lines or completely parallel

376
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,090
now this is just an example

377
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,640
if you look at the dot where in john's
study of punctuality you see an example

378
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,460
of the independents

379
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,120
also the person and at the art of the
situation

380
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,460
here we have

381
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,290
all subjects

382
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:45,730
classified as high and low in
conscientious as that's the personality

383
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,560
variable

384
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,190
and we have subjects arriving for
morning

385
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,870
and for afternoon appointments that's
the environmental variable

386
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,809
and you can see

387
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:58,559
that these lines are almost perfectly
parallel

388
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,779
you could be

389
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:03,350
highly conscientious or not very
conscientious

390
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,700
if your appointment is for the morning
you're going to turn to a crime of late

391
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,980
if your appointment is for the evening
unprofor the afternoon

392
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,000
europe are going to tend not to arrive
late

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,390
and vice versa

394
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,820
dot the fact of the personality variable
is completely independent

395
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,940
all of the effects

396
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,020
all the

397
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,150
although the environmental variables so
here we go

398
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,080
there at the future of person
environment independence is first

399
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,080
the effect of the personality is the
same regardless of the situation the

400
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,669
person is in

401
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:35,679
and second

402
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,220
the effect of the situational variables
it's the same

403
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,980
regardless of the kind of person

404
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,150
okay

405
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,480
conscientious people can attend to
arrive early for their appointments not

406
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,690
late

407
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,669
people have appointments in the morning

408
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:51,940
tend to arrive late

409
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,570
as opposed to people who have
appointments in the fall in the yard in

410
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,400
the afternoon

411
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,250
now the idea that person variable
doubling the postal determines the

412
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,269
behavior in the environmental determines
the behavior

413
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:09,149
were independent of each other lag in
the history a personality and social

414
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:09,649
psychology

415
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:11,640
to what kind of competition

416
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,909
kind of competition you see between a
red fox and a yankees okay

417
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:19,370
all of basically to say which affect is
more powerful

418
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:23,450
but first of all although the affect of
or personality traits

419
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,510
or to be a fact of situational although
variance

420
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,539
off however people came to understand
quite quickly

421
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:36,769
that this is really not the right way to
frame the question about the relations

422
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:37,700
between

423
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,940
the personal determinants of behavior

424
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,760
and the environmental determines the
behavior

425
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,169
because in fact

426
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:47,920
the personal and the environmental
determines the behavior arch

427
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,740
not independent of each other

428
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,330
rather they seem to affect each other

429
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,030
puttin the technical language

430
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,769
the person and the environment tends to
contract

431
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:03,080
and the first person to really talk
about this a lot

432
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,549
was the late kenneth powers of god
canadian and american psychologist work

433
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:08,350
for

434
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,490
almost his entire career at the
university of waterloo

435
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,760
so in nineteen seventy three

436
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,679
announced what has come to be called

437
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,220
the doctrine of interaction ism

438
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,720
he says block

439
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,070
neither traits number two situations are
the primary determines the behavior

440
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,560
for the simple reason

441
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:32,460
that situations are as much of function
of the person's behavior

442
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,169
as the person's behavior is of function
of the situation

443
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:39,680
what powers meant by that was

444
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,660
people a fact the environments

445
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,240
which in turn off that their behavior

446
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,640
it if people are affecting their
environments

447
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,250
the person purcell determines the
behavior and the environmental divall

448
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,390
determines behavior

449
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,470
are no longer independent

450
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,270
so what we really have in borrowers view
is a situation like this

451
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,540
where we have

452
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,920
personality traits like friendliness

453
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,029
that might affect behavior

454
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:12,659
and we have environmental conditions
like whether you're with all stranger or

455
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,450
acquaintance that might affect your
behavior

456
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,410
dog and you've got or the personality
factors that will affect the environment

457
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,330
itself

458
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,180
this is

459
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,299
the all of the ki

460
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,019
to with darker and by the addressee
resum

461
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:28,859
and later on in these lectures

462
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:31,240
we're going to talk about the various
ways

463
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,050
in which people of fact

464
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,160
the these situations or the environments

465
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,280
which intern influence

466
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,690
their behavior

467
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,200
but to continue our examples here

468
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,020
here is about

469
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,920
specimen

470
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,030
example all of what we mean by
interaction is on

471
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:53,780
here again we've got or subjects
classified in terms of friendliness high

472
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,970
and low

473
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,100
and we've got

474
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,480
our situations classified whether there
is a static wings of the situation or

475
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,810
whether there's a stranger in a
situation

476
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:05,920
note that this graph looks a little bit
different from the other one i showed

477
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,610
you

478
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,820
here we have still behavior as predicted
by the personality trait

479
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,720
so friendly people are more likely to
smile than on the friendly people

480
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,510
and

481
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,279
behavior is still affected by the
situation people are more likely to

482
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,200
smile in the presence of an acquaintance

483
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,440
than they are in the stranger but in the
presence of a stranger

484
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,570
but noticed but these are facts are

485
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,530
no longer independent of each other

486
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,410
it makes a difference

487
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,510
how you behaved in the situation

488
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,899
depending on what kind of person you
wore

489
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:42,930
so if you work pay friendly person

490
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,220
flyover more

491
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,070
in the presence of an acquaintance

492
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,419
fall under the bed a stranger but
there's not that much of a difference

493
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:55,309
friendly people just smile all the time
right that's one of the ways we know

494
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,710
that they're friendly

495
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,619
here we have these aren't friendly
people not so friendly people

496
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,590
who make a big discrimination

497
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,370
between the one situation

498
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,370
and the other

499
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:10,470
so here we have an example of how the
effect of the person and the effect of

500
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,419
the environment our message of on
behavior

501
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,520
are not independent of each other

502
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,789
at matters

503
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:22,350
what kind of person isn what kind of of
situation

504
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,650
so again just to spell this out

505
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,310
all if we look at the features of the
person all environment interaction

506
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,140
we can say that

507
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,249
persons and environments in iraq when
the effect of the person

508
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:37,800
depends on the kind of situation

509
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,770
that person

510
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,849
we can say

511
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:46,480
the effect of a situation depends on the
kind of person

512
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,440
who is in it

513
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,380
and again here are some other examples
as a somewhat more dramatic examples of

514
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,650
the person by situation erection

515
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,590
this is what's known as the crossover
interaction

516
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,150
where

517
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,299
you have people who are

518
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,850
hari

519
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,230
friendliness or the high on some trade

520
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:12,000
they behave in one way in situation a
completely opposite way in situation

521
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,990
beat and here we have people were low on
some trade

522
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,850
and they show exactly the opposite
pattern of behavior

523
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,750
notice here

524
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,190
that neither the trait nor the situation
alone predicts anything if you average

525
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,120
across

526
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,660
the two levels of traits

527
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,450
you see there is no difference

528
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,220
between them

529
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,610
if you ever to cross the through
situations

530
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,480
you see there's no difference the action
columns

531
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,850
when you take into account

532
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,960
the person

533
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,320
and the situation

534
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,960
and how they interact

535
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,450
here's another pattern of person by
situation interaction

536
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,660
known as a fan effect because well

537
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,340
it looks like a friend

538
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,450
here we have

539
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,999
in situation a

540
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:52,009
there's no difference in behavior

541
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:52,869
between

542
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:56,570
people who were high on some trait and
people who were low on some three

543
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,499
the differences between these kinds of
people

544
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:03,919
only four lives in certain kinds of
situations

545
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,340
situations like situation b

546
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,630
the art of the differences between them

547
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,360
magnified

548
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,160
okay so again what you can see here

549
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,989
is that their is

550
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:16,970
and you know that there's this
interaction

551
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,710
the behavior of people depends

552
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,879
both on the kind of person

553
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:25,970
and on the kind of situation

554
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,710
therein

555
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,740
just to make this even more interesting

556
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:36,380
let's go back to disfigure auditor picks
the standard view of all of interaction

557
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,020
ism where we have

558
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,510
personal personal characteristics
influencing behavior

559
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,960
an environmental characteristics

560
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,119
influencing behavior

561
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,080
and now we have bowers doctrine of
interaction is in which says

562
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,650
that people

563
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,030
influence

564
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:56,460
the situations that influence that in
turn influence their behavior

565
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,889
this is every do you have a the u_n_ a
directional

566
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:01,880
interaction is on

567
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,489
while you were rather a u_n_ directional
view of interaction ism

568
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:06,809
because if you'll notice

569
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:08,960
the all causal pathways

570
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,880
all goat in one direction

571
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,750
from the person

572
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,730
to his or her behavior

573
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,010
from the environment

574
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,069
the behavior that occurs in it

575
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,520
on and from the person

576
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,039
the environment

577
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,669
it could be more interesting than that

578
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:30,140
if the person can affect the environment

579
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,440
while you shouldn't be environment
exhort reciprocal

580
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,950
affect on the carson okay so here we
have the person affecting the

581
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,769
environment

582
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:40,610
here we have the environment

583
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:44,899
affecting the person i was at the opera
yesterday when magic flute dual want to

584
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:48,089
go see a really nice production of magic
flute go see it

585
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:53,150
but i happen to be way up in the balcony
it was hotter than hell in there

586
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,190
and i was we were trying to get in time
for the end of the first act

587
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,210
you can see people were getting ornery

588
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,850
you know there was a lot more shashi no
children and all sorts of stuff that had

589
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,670
occurred later on

590
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,760
part of the the at the end of the
staffing us in the balcony

591
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,870
well

592
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:12,850
making people feel bad ok and one way or
another

593
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:18,000
about or about their circumstances so
that's just a kind of trivial example

594
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,150
that we don't know what i broke out or
anything like that

595
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,230
but again

596
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,070
to think about how the environment
you're in ten shape

597
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,460
your own personal characteristics okay

598
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,360
so here we have an example

599
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,520
all douglas epochal

600
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,119
causal affect

601
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,289
between the person in the environment
people shaping the environment in which

602
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:40,300
they behave

603
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,040
the environment shaping

604
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,030
or the person

605
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,920
who admits

606
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,650
the behavior

607
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,340
similarly

608
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:55,159
personal effects ok turned that personal
determinants can affect our behavior

609
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:57,019
maybe it's also true

610
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:02,289
that our behavior tend shape us
reciprocal e check the kind of person we

611
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:03,640
are

612
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,499
probably everybody in this room has had
the uh... lopez had the experience of

613
00:29:07,499 --> 00:29:10,639
you know not knowing whether you could
do something with you could kind of run

614
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:14,119
that faster ask her for a date or
whatever and then you kind of screw up

615
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,180
your courage and you do it

616
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,430
and at work so what is a all can do this

617
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:24,480
i'm the kind of person who can't do this
kind of assault didn't advance yourself

618
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,930
before right

619
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:31,630
observations of your own behavior shaped
your self image bom

620
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,900
also a dead

621
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,230
if the person

622
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,679
ten determine his or her own behavior

623
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:39,730
why shouldn't behavior feedback

624
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,460
okay to shape the person

625
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,919
as well

626
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,430
and similarly

627
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:50,160
the environment can affect the behavior
that occur is that

628
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,080
which we know

629
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,130
it can

630
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:53,630
shirley

631
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,919
we had the behavior that occurs in the
environment

632
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,059
ten affect the environment itself

633
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:00,640
all

634
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,490
if you will and never be a note concert
world or or or a player whatever when

635
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,310
somebody starts coughing what happens

636
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,270
the everybody's coffee different

637
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:15,470
i thought it would be a little bear that
has the already transformed the theater

638
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:19,320
from a nice quiet environment into an
environment in which all sorts of coffee

639
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,190
was taking place right

640
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,670
the people's behavior

641
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,540
can change

642
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,739
the environments

643
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,990
in which that behavior

644
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,589
so i can but we want to think about now

645
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:36,609
is not that cordial relations among
persons and environments and behaviors

646
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:41,070
as somehow unit directional when
everything's kind of going off like like

647
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,170
bill your balls

648
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:47,540
but rather that there are reciprocal
whole relations

649
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,030
between each of these elements in looms
equation

650
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,980
reciprocal causal relations between the
person

651
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,640
and his or her behavior

652
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,399
between the environment and the behavior
the takes place in it

653
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,290
and between

654
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,680
the behavior the person and the
environment

655
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,160
this is

656
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,270
is the essence i have a doctrine known
as the doctrine of reciprocal

657
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,750
determinism

658
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:15,860
which was although formulated by albert
bandara a psychologist at stanford

659
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,989
university

660
00:31:16,989 --> 00:31:20,670
here we have a moment of silence for
booths and bones

661
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,419
armed up basically

662
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:25,419
what douglas argued was that

663
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:28,199
but person the environment

664
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:30,080
and behavior

665
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,490
constituted dynamic system of k a
dynamic system in which

666
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,799
each of these elements

667
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:38,750
is our class of the other two

668
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:43,860
and each of these elements is in effect
the other two we're no longer

669
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,750
identifying clauses as causes and
effects of the facts anymore each of

670
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:52,940
these elements is serving both as a
cause and effect this is the

671
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,090
or the essence

672
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,519
all got a lot of our dynamic system

673
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,309
so we've actually got

674
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:02,850
as a part of the heart of the system it
looks like this

675
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:06,320
there or reciprocal calls the relations
between the person

676
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,500
and his or her behavior

677
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,590
reciprocal causal relations between the
environment

678
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,340
and the behavior the takes place in it

679
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:20,350
reciprocal calls the relations between
the person and the environment dot

680
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,529
i'll do my best but that's why i give
slides out in advance ok palm

681
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:28,559
so i can kind of get through the vessel
warlike terms four days

682
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,640
all i'll try to slow down thanks

683
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,840
okay

684
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,020
bartenders just another view of this

685
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:41,530
also brenda has sometimes called this at
this situation tried attic reciprocate

686
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,260
ality

687
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,400
because there are three elements the
behavior

688
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,530
the person

689
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:52,010
and the environment and there are
reciprocal causal relations between each

690
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:52,749
of them

691
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:55,460
between a person and his or her behavior

692
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,730
between the environment

693
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,350
and his or her behavior

694
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:02,090
between a person and the environment

695
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,419
note however

696
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:06,130
that let me say that there is

697
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,629
reciprocal close hourly or

698
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:11,160
bender is terms reciprocal determinism

699
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,260
we don't necessarily mean

700
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,520
that these causal relations are all
symmetrical

701
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,940
all right we mean is that the causal
relations are bi-directional we don't

702
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:28,110
necessarily mean that all these calls
the relations or of equal strength

703
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,200
it might be

704
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,190
that the close the link between the
person and b

705
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,559
and his or her behavior

706
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,200
is very strong

707
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,629
and the reciprocal link between behavior
feeding back on the person

708
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:41,410
is somewhat weak

709
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,539
that's an empirical question

710
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:45,050
but they've got there

711
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,880
the point is in principle they're both
there

712
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,590
nor

713
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:53,399
dual all of these causal linkages

714
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,660
work themselves out final tenuously

715
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,919
it's not necessarily the case

716
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,240
that the person is shaping the
environment

717
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,780
at precisely the same time

718
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,340
as the environment is reciprocal e

719
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:11,420
shaping the person but rather usually
going to be the case

720
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,679
is that things kind of unfold over time

721
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,299
in the same way that one person coffee
nana theater

722
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:21,510
will lead later to a couple more people
coffin in the theater

723
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,290
which will lead later to a couple more
people coughing too have been theater to

724
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,610
make in the first person to pull off
really self-conscious about having

725
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,540
started this

726
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,330
which will become coffee even harder
okay

727
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,670
which hopefully with the having

728
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,820
in the theater

729
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,609
also there pretty soon

730
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:41,029
the players can't do what they're
supposed to do

731
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:43,199
all this takes place over time

732
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,209
but the fact that it takes place over
time isn't what's important what's

733
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:49,909
important is that the causal

734
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:52,739
influences org bi-directional

735
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:56,220
everything is a clause in this system
and everything

736
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,339
is in effect

737
00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:00,639
okay that's nice in principle

738
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,430
but everything is affecting everything
else

739
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,420
when everything is fine what it is

740
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:11,179
more or less libel taneous lee to be
thought of as a clause and effect

741
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:13,330
things can get complicated

742
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,819
very quickly

743
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:17,819
for that reason

744
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:22,650
they're going to do in these lectures is
to engage in a strategy known as

745
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,269
analytic composition we're going to
break this

746
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:30,289
this complex system down into basically
three

747
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:30,789
parts

748
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:33,640
well it's going to be six parts but
we're going to talk about

749
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,139
free first

750
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:36,620
first we're going to look at

751
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:42,839
the reciprocal relation between the
person and his or her behavior

752
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,359
then we're going to look at the
reciprocal relations between the

753
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:49,949
environment and the behavior that takes
place in it

754
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:51,220
and then finally

755
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,809
we're going to take a look at the
reciprocal relation between the person

756
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:57,420
and the environment

757
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,279
there's going to be a kind of dialogue

758
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:01,200
between

759
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,189
each of these elements person behavior

760
00:36:05,189 --> 00:36:07,219
environment behavior

761
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:07,880
person

762
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,040
and environment

763
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,769
and there were three of them

764
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:17,440
and these constitu what we michael for
three dialect x or the three dialogues

765
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,929
in social interaction

766
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:21,969
the dialogue between the person and
behavior

767
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:23,789
between

768
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:28,129
environment and behavior and between the
person and the situation

769
00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:30,769
okay so that's the framework

770
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:33,400
very generic very abstract framework

771
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,159
and now we're going to do is taken apart
and illustrate how it works

772
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,539
some actual

773
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:41,389
research findings

774
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:48,389
let's look first that the relation
between the person and the environment

775
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,839
domain we would think about this

776
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,809
is pretty much the way traditional
personality also ecology has thought

777
00:36:55,809 --> 00:36:56,859
about it

778
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:58,289
that there are

779
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:05,289
people had internal states and internal
dispositions that lead them to be heavy

780
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:08,209
in a particular way

781
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:10,970
and in personality and social psychology

782
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:15,600
were mostly are interested in two
different kinds of dispositions

783
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,589
traits

784
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:18,079
which are

785
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,399
behavioral dispositions

786
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:23,349
betrayal friendliness is odd disposition
ted

787
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:26,869
the friendly this position to behave in
a friendly way

788
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:31,959
the trade of extra version is odd
disposition to behave in a extroverted

789
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,719
outgoing way

790
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:39,029
we could think about that includes as
value ative dispositions that is

791
00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:39,660
tendencies

792
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,170
to have

793
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:41,580
positive

794
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,169
or negative

795
00:37:43,169 --> 00:37:43,760
values

796
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,269
all on on various kinds of things

797
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:48,159
so

798
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:50,179
if you're a four or against

799
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:51,509
the war in iraq

800
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:54,379
if you're for or against all

801
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:55,059
racism

802
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:58,709
if you're for or against nuclear power
plants

803
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,019
does or

804
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:02,329
attitudes their evaluative dispositions

805
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:04,620
that presumably lead you to behave

806
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,049
in uh... in particular ways

807
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:10,510
so what we want to do again is to
measure

808
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:14,670
these personal determines the behavior
measured people's traits measured

809
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:18,660
people's attitudes and we do this
basically in one of

810
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,009
to ways

811
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:22,839
either by collecting self reports

812
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:26,069
order by doing something more objective

813
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:27,790
on the self reports all right

814
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,609
we can administer u

815
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:33,380
psalm questionnaires the various kinds

to observe you smile

836
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,790
what we want to do

837
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,380
to begin

838
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,999
looking at all

839
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:39,579
followed defects of dispositions on
behavior and the reciprocal affect our

840
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,549
behavior on dispositions

841
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:45,580
is to measure these dispositions and
that takes us to our next problem

842
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,849
which is

843
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:50,619
then there are a lot of dispositions out
there

thing which dictionary

846
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,150
and actually counted

847
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,729
all the different words in the english
language

848
00:39:59,729 --> 00:40:01,599
that could be used to

849
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,000
discriminate between one person and
another in psychological terms

850
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,720
okay

851

student on burke

854
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,880
determined there were seventeen thousand
nine hundred fifty three such terms in

855
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,219
the english language actually

856
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:20,070
the horrible

857
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:23,089
there too horrible things here being
discounted

858
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:26,479
fault they're actually seventeen
thousand nine hundred fifty four

859
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:29,899
all of the first horrible things they
miss counted the second horrible things

860
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:34,640
that somebody actually checked them

861
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,680
what happened there

862
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,850
but in any event

863
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:41,320
yeah i don't know if eighteen thousand
different words in english that ten the

864
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,450
youth ascribe the psychological
differences between people we are not

865
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,760
believe me we are not going to measure
follow all of these

866
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,269
there's gotta be some weight

867
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:53,429
to reduce this set

868
00:40:53,429 --> 00:40:56,680
all and over a period of decades

869
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,090
psychologists use in a statistical
technique called factor analysis which

870
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,540
is based on the correlation coefficient

871
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:07,349
and about which you have to know nothing
more

872
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:09,540
have accidents us leary boost

873
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:14,559
this list of seventeen thousand nine
hundred fifty four different rate terms

874
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,659
to just five

875
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:19,909

00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:05,230
uh...

898
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,829
did agree to a church curious

899
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:09,550
a magic tive

900
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,910
artistic and so on and so forth

901
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,789
these are known as the big five
personality traits

902
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:18,650
and they provide a very good

903
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,920
very

904
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,210
eve ficient framework for capturing
individual differences in personality

905
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,049
are between people

906
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:29,690
all up to a good first approximation

907
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,119
those seventeen thousand nine hundred
and fifty three thirteen thousand nine

908
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,959
hundred fifty-four dislike a logical
differences between people

909
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:40,719
all boil down

910
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:42,529
five personality traits

911
00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:45,299
and you might say to you know that's
kind of

912
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:47,319
that's

913
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:50,600
we heard that you can you can boil it
down to just these five

914
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,970
but if you think about it for a second

915
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,390
are

916
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,870
if you wanted to know something about
somebody

917
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,869
this is what you want to know

918
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:02,019
alike all these the big five blind date
questions right

919
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:04,369
arnett if you've got to go out with
somebody i don't know all these other

920
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:06,630
things you want to know about him or her

921
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,330
this saw busy all going to see crazy is
the friendly as the reliable it is the

922
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,169
interesting

923
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:14,079
everything else where there is a good
kessler

924
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,609
whether redress as well or whatever that
comes later all but this is what you

925
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:22,059
want to know if you're going to spend a
couple of hours with somebody

926
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:23,319
on any of

927
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:24,689
went on a friday night

928
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:27,039
there it is something basic

929
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:28,369
about

930
00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:30,499
dimensions okay

931
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:35,619
although it's these dimensions on which
personality psychology has focused

932
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:38,539
over the last all over the last couple
of decades

933
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:41,410
just to go through them very quickly

934
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,719
again how do we do assess these things
well first in terms of

935
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:48,029
self-report questionnaires okay

936
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:49,069
although

937
00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:51,109
aren't you really like most people you
meet

938
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:53,719
if you like to have a lot of people
around you

939
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:58,419
if you are often a leader if you often
feel like you're bursting with energy

940
00:43:58,419 --> 00:44:02,389
all if you do things just for kicks if
you're a cheerful high-spirited person

941
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:07,729
your ohio an extra version ok so we can
assess your degree of extra version in

942
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,899
terms of

943
00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:14,079
behavioral technology behaviors that you
yourself report on

944
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,860
we can just ask you to use

945
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,960
some adjectives

946
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,240
if you're friendly warman sociable

947
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,300
if you're little aggressive not to
aggressive a little aggressive

948
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,650
self-confident assertive

949
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:30,859
if your pleasure seeking adventurous
optimistic again you're going to score

950
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:34,839
relatively high conduct on the test of
extroverted

951
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:35,320
again

952
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,410
the administer these kinds of
personality questionnaires and what we

953
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,339
get

954
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:45,140
you get distribution of extra virgin
scores that looks like this this is the

955
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:50,039
so-called normal distribution what we
sometimes think of as the bell shaper

956
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:55,179
where there are very few people who are
very low an extra version

957
00:44:55,179 --> 00:45:01,199
very few people who are very high an
extra version and most people somewhere

958
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,619
that'll that's the distribution of extra
version

959
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:06,519
based on of thousand college students

960
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:10,829
all fifteen years ago hasn't changed
much

961
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:14,090
we can assess neuroticism in pretty much
the same way

962
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:18,189
by our people's tendency to be anxious
depressed

963
00:45:18,189 --> 00:45:22,410
or angry self-conscious and so on

964
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,509
and you get a distribution it looks like
this

965
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:30,319
not too many people really let one x
drawn on dorado sizzle

966
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:35,679
not too many really high on dorado
schism falling either but this nice

967
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:38,520
normal distribution this nice bell
shaped kore

968
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,009
with most people

969
00:45:40,009 --> 00:45:43,569
somewhere

970
00:45:43,569 --> 00:45:45,529
for every other mess

971
00:45:45,529 --> 00:45:47,780
reassess people in terms of

972
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,780
also trust in the our host
straightforward they are hokum pauline

973
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,880
kael modest

974
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,789
how altruistic

975
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:59,459
then you get a distribution the looks
like that

976
00:45:59,459 --> 00:46:01,889
again not too many people

977
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:03,279
really disagreeable

978
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:05,439
we think about it there are about

979
00:46:05,439 --> 00:46:08,749
people who are really disapproval life
just your roommate and a couple of

980
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:10,399
others

981
00:46:10,399 --> 00:46:13,839
on fewer again on the other side

982
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,660
very few people really haryana agreeable
nis

983
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:19,980
but most people falling in between this
nice

984
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,229
fell shape

985
00:46:21,229 --> 00:46:25,179
normal distribution

986
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:28,339
assess conscientious this in terms of
competence

987
00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:29,429
worldliness

988
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:34,839
dutiful nis all self-discipline things
like that

989
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:35,970
endure jet

990
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:39,459
this nice distribution not too many lows

991
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:43,489
not too many holidays most people in
between

992
00:46:43,489 --> 00:46:43,880
characteristic

993
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,440
dole shaped normal distribution

994
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,249
and then finally

995
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:51,459
facets of openness in terms of

996
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:53,819
with you got a rich fantasy life

997
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:59,160
are with your open a new ideas whether
your open willing to try new things

998
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,470
we'll go to an exotic restaurant you
know stuff like that

999
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:04,689
and again

1000
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,970
not too many people really low

1001
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:09,169
not too many people really high

1002
00:47:09,169 --> 00:47:11,169
most people

1003
00:47:11,169 --> 00:47:14,200
somewhere

1004
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,999
this normal distribution

1005
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:21,749
is a characteristic almost personality
variables

1006
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:26,639
we did find it very few people at the
tales most people long-time in towards

1007
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:27,670
the middle

1008
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,310
all you get the same kind of cr

1009
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:33,690
for measured intelligence you get pretty
much the same kind of kirk for exam

1010
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,630
scores this normal distribution of
individual differences

1011
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,309
is very very very characteristic

1012
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:41,580
of what we find

1013
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:46,059
when we do this kind alvo this kind of
research

1014
00:47:46,059 --> 00:47:48,369
had no what we want to do

1015
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:49,759
say

1016
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,049
now that we've assess these individual
differences

1017
00:47:53,049 --> 00:47:55,199
what are they going to do with the

1018
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:57,780
how can we use these individual
differences

1019
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,279
to predict

1020
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:03,670
all people are going to be havior in
specific situations

1021
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:05,900
that's the goal of this

1022
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,880
and that's the thought mobile take-up
next time on wednesday

1023
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,900
hard to get from

1024
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,230
personality dispositions

1025
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,880
to actual behavior

1026
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,539
in some specific situation

1027
00:48:17,539 --> 00:48:17,969
thank you very much
