1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,650
okay

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,409
highbeam discussed these physical basis
of the mind and our brain

3
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:16,279
and the rest of the nervous system

4
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:23,140
were not on a position to talk about
what it is that the line dollars

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,759
and

6
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:27,470
it turns out that a major function of
the mind is to acquire

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,449
and use knowledge

8
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:32,099
too

9
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,020
produced adaptive behavior of various
crimes

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,820
what organisms to especially human
beings

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,930
is we are quieter

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,420
knowledge in the form of

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,100
various kinds of mental representations
of the world around us

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,950
so we need to forum internal
representations of the world

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,600
that's the job of perception

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
store it

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
stories representations for later use

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,670
that's the job of memory

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,110
too

20
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,909
reflect on and transform and manipulate
this knowledge

21
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:07,529
that's what goes under the rubric called

22
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:10,619
on the reasoning and problem solving and

23
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,670
twenty mintues fighting and choosing

24
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,400
we use this knowledge

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,290
in or behavior

26
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,620
what's known in the traders are chin

27
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,240
and then we communicate

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,549
this knowledge to other people

29
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,070
using the medium

30
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,820
language

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,850
so

32
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,720
major functional blindness to engage in
these climate of operations

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,239
to mediate

34
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,990
adoptive all of the here

35
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,170
or to mediate

36
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,880
munir actions between the individual

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,289
and

38
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,829
the world

39
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:42,590
traditionally

40
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,780
this knowledge was construed in terms of
associations

41
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,700
associations of various kinds

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,360
first our associations among events

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,340
that is

44
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,650
all associations on

45
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,570
boa between events that occur in the
environment

46
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,680
and between the all of these events in
the organisms response to them

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,390
but also associations between the
organisms actions

48
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,390
and there are facts on the environment
so if you're president gauges and some

49
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,550
piece of behavior

50
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,849
what happens in at the world outside

51
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:22,639
these are the kinds of associations that
formed the basis or traditional views of

52
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,580
learning

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,249
and uh... and thinking

54
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,530
it turns out

55
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,489
that some of these association some of
these stimulus response associations

56
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,459
or innate

57
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:35,050
their pre wired

58
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,749
they calm as part all of the organisms
endowment

59
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:42,059
and we usually think about there being

60
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:44,270
three general types

61
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,099
all of the d_n_a_ responses to
stimulation

62
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,680
the first of these that we've discussed

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,330
before

64
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,859
are simple reflexes

65
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:58,949
that involve individual muscles example
we discussed before was the patellar

66
00:02:58,949 --> 00:02:59,660
reflex

67
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,629
refute tap the patellar tendon

68
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:04,170
knee-jerk

69
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,290
our response

70
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,570
uh... that's in innate reflex it's the
wave my nervous system and yours too

71
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:16,310
is owner is built but there are lots of
these is our repertoire another of

72
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,130
one that you'll see a lot of reference
to

73
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,340
is the idyllic reflex

74
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,649
when you go to your ophthalmologist rear
or or your optometrist

75
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:29,429
after annual audit sam what he or she
will often do is bob

76
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:32,199
prajam pick as a little machine the
presents a puff of air

77
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,689
to your accordion

78
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,999
and there's a natural response to blink

79
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,540
onto that puff of air

80
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,290
that's an innate reflex

81
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,969
nervous systems wired to do that

82
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:43,499
all reflexes

83
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:47,779
are very simple stimulus response
associations

84
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:48,900
that are in it

85
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,870
and they involve the activity of

86
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,989
individual muscles

87
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:57,150
single muscles a single set of muscles
in the iva produces the i believe reflex

88
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,019
there's a single set of muscles in the
heart attacks is d patellar tendon

89
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,529
that all produces all of the patellar
reflex

90
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:07,989
both reflexes

91
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:11,189
are we also have taxis

92
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,019
okay

93
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,189
the singular is taxes

94
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:17,569
and these are innate stimulus response

95
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:18,140
patterns

96
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,629
that involve the entire body involve the
entire

97
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,410
skeletal musculature

98
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,159
all of the organism

99
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:28,500
also that the organism

100
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,650
basically move

101
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,870
in response

102
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,110
the psalm

103
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,020
stardom to some stimulus or another

104
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,039
we generally think of taxis is coming
into congress

105
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,260
positive taxis

106
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,529
where the organism moves toward some
stimulus

107
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:45,370
negative

108
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,190
taxis

109
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,059
where the organism moves away

110
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:50,940
stimulus

111
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,569
and there are all

112
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:53,480
also

113
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,020
photo taxis which are orientation
responses to light if your route on your

114
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,270
back yard after dark and you've got a
candle going or sell or a flashlight or

115
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,330
whatever

116
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,449
almost will tend to move toward the
light

117
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:08,729
they're just plain a positive

118
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:11,400
photo taxes they're moving toward

119
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,470
alight stimulus

120
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,400
on some of the invertebrates

121
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,099
worms and things like that can find in
your garden

122
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:21,560
we all engage in what's known as a
negative

123
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,370
geo taxes decline up things

124
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,000
okay

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,550
so they are orienting negatively

126
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,979
towards the stimulus

127
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,360
of oval of gravity

128
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,639
intial

129
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,639
wermer something will encounter a
barrier

130
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,020
that wouldn't all

131
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,740
okay and try to try to go over

132
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,590
taxis are also very simple stimulus
response connections

133
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,580
but in contrast to reflexes

134
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,340
they involve the entire skeletal
musculature or pretty much the entire

135
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,680
skull musculature

136
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,090
all of the organism

137
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,789
and you see these taxis

138
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:58,449
all felt prominently in the behavior of
invertebrate organisms blogs

139
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:00,150
of various crimes

140
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:06,330
and then finally we have more complex
innate stimulus response connections

141
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,470
are known as instincts

142
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,240
or fixed action patterns

143
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,930
these are innate patterns of behavior
that are shaped by a pollution

144
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,190
on to help the organism

145
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,830
audience of orthodox to a particular
requirement

146
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,400
are like reflexes and taxis

147
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,690
they can be very very complicated

148
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,749
okay

149
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:29,659
on

150
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:31,410
very complicated patterns

151
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,039
of stimulus and response

152
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,910
here is all it'd be a good example

153
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,710
on food bedding

154
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,679
inherent goals

155
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:43,440
this is work by nico ten bergen won the
nobel prize

156
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,159
for this work very important in the
history

157
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,569

be fed by their parents

160
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:59,909

look at what they do that they would

00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:24,689
thieves the herring gull checked all
leave wednesday

172
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:28,050
engages in what's known as a food
begging response

173
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,410
by packing

174
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,740
that a

175
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,740
reddish or orange reddish spot

176
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,729
on the lower mandible of the adult

177
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:38,200
so what happens is there's a adult
there's a check

178
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,110
the check will

179
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,490
the all lower mandible of the uh... of
the adult

180
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,580
and the dogged old will

181
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,880
respond by

182
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,159
delivering food into with a mild of the
check

183
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,800
the cheque is responding to the presence
of

184
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
spots on the mandible

185
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,530
and to be dulled is responding to the

186
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,430
ordered don't go to the goal check

187
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,469
if the check doesn't bag it doesn't get
fed

188
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:07,319
okay

189
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,630
but as ten bergen found out

190
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:15,400
that chick does and peg unless there's
an appropriate really seems phyllis in

191
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,599
the environment

192
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,990
here's an experimental ten bergen did

193
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,850
in which the looked at the all food
begging behavior

194
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,990
all checks

195
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,460
when they were presented with on adult
with a

196
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,209
usual

197
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:34,180
of red orange red spot on the lower
mandible lots of food begging behavior

198
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,149
here the all adults

199
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,080
had their of spot painted black

200
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,830
okay

201
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:46,750
are just it's removable rate but it was
painted black and the chicks still

202
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,450
packed allot store begged for food

203
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,899
when the v_ bill was painted blue

204
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,240
they also

205
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,220
are begged for food quite a bit

206
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,639
but when the bill was painted white
remember that herring gold bills are

207
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,980
kind of yellow wheat

208
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,990
on you'll see a too much there's less

209
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,510
of begging behavior

210
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,050
and when there's no spot when the

211
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,170
when the spots been painted so that it
blends right into of the bill

212
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,800
there's very little baking behavior at
all

213
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,680
so the relief instead he was four

214
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,199
of the four foot begging on the part of
the check

215
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:23,029
turns out to be

216
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,869
are contrasting spot on the lower
mandible

217
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:30,009
it doesn't really matter what color it
is as long as there's a contrast as long

218
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:32,209
as there is dark against are

219
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:33,829
as long as a stark against white

220
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:35,280
the animal all day

221
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,920
but notice that this is now a very
complicated sequence of behaviors

222
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,740
but check

223
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,809
has to beg

224
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:45,050
the adult has to have the right feature
on its bill

225
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,519
if the adult doesn't have the right
feature the check isn't going to bed

226
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,990
if the check doesn't bag

227
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,199
then the chickens and gonna get fed this
is a characteristic feature

228
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:57,020
all these instinct for fixed action
patterns

229
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,810
that they usually involved

230
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,190
are very

231
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,880
discriminative responses to stimulation

232
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,890
with the patellar tendon reflex

233
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,970
it doesn't matter what you hit my
patellar tendon with

234
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,449
it can be a hammer like my doctor does
it could be a book

235
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:15,589
it could be an automobile it could be
anything you hit my patellar tendon with

236
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:18,460
and all responded megs actually the same
way

237
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,860
but here

238
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,590
there's got to be that contrasting spot
or nothing happens and it's gotta be

239
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,940
responded to with a pack

240
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,410
nothing on nothing happens

241
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,780
so these in haiti

242
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,590
behavioral responses

243
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,040
discriminative all those stimulation

244
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,779
are shaped by your pollution and the
point here is the point i made last time

245
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:41,420
too

246
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,069
that apparently evolution shapes more
than body morphology

247
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:48,279
evolution also can shape

248
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,150
patterns of behavior

249
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,210
all permitting

250
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,539
all various species to adapt

251
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:55,990
to their environmental neesh

252
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,750
and these

253
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,250
instincts were fixed action patterns
built-in viable lucien

254
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,610
are fine

255
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:08,050
they allow organisms to live in their
particular environmental nations that

256
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,240
works fine so long as the environment
doesn't change

257
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,620
but when the environment changes

258
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,340
this behavior that's been slowly shaped
by evolution over

259
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,730
the alliance of evolutionary time

260
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,420
ten column to be malad apto

261
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,650
very good example of this

262
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:32,550
is all a positive photo taxes in baby
sea turtles you've all seen this on

263
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,820
nature programs and lynn martin and
television

264
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,510
on sea turtles female sitter rolls come
up

265
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,600
onto the ashore

266
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,309
orbit

267
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:47,199
dig a nast above the tide line in which
they

268
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:51,880
deposit their regs and they go back out
to see and do whatever it is too liberal

269
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,510
on sea turtles do

270
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,000
the of the baby sea turtles when they
hatch what they end up doing to crawl

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,140
out of the nest

272
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,040
and they run

273
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,790
to the seas so that they can start
swimming

274
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,200
on doing all those other things that sea
turtles or are supposed to be doing

275
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,920
now it turns out

276
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,640
although

277
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:15,820
that these babies theater roles are not
actually running toward the sea

278
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,560
what they're running toward

279
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,720
is the light of the moon reflected upon
the water

280
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,749
it is a positive

281
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,969
follow taxes they're running toward

282
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:28,560
a source of light

283
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,140
and that's fine

284
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,950
all

285
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,320
so long as there is and that the other
source of light around

286
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,630
but in modern society there are often
lots of other sources of light on the

287
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,170
beach

288
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,200
there might be automobiles on the beach
there might be a loyal refinery nearby

289
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,630
there might be a hotel or a casino
nearby

290
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,920
and what will happen is

291
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,300
the sea turtles well-run towards those
lights

292
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,360
as well

293
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,300
and if they run pride they happen to run
toward the sea everything works out

294
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,050
hunky-dory for the sea turtle

295
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:04,500
but if the if the turtle ads are running
for the oil refinery or the casino or

296
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,270
the all-terrain vehicle that just
happens to have its lights on at that

297
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:13,910
moment things are going to go very well
for the of them for the sea turtle and

298
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,230
so that creates a serious thought threat
ought to

299
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,010
to the species okay

300
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,290
so what happens now

301
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,529
is that also this example illustrates

302
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,700
some rb

303
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,420
limitations

304
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,999
all of these innate responses to
stimulation

305
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:34,169
represented by

306
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:37,310
fixed pattern action patterns

307
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,600
in order for the instinctual behavior to
occur

308
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,340
this stimulus must be physically present
in the environment

309
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,489
for the baby and for the sea turtles to
run to the sea the mood has to be out

310
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:51,390
there has to be

311
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,300
arap actual moon whose light is
reflected on the water for the herring

312
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,169
gull check to get food there has to be a
contrasting spot

313
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:01,360
on the all lower mandible

314
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,310
volvo be adult

315
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,930
the second point is

316
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,990
bibd because sleeves on

317
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,289
these are two

318
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:13,870
behavioral responses these instinctual
behaviors

319
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,729
had been shaped by a balloon shin

320
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:20,639
the organism isn't capable by virtue of
these innate response patterns

321
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,350
to respond to a new stimulus

322
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,970
is not the guarded

323
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,800
the eve the stimulus is their or it
isn't

324
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,089
on

325
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:30,349
you can't have

326
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:34,449
on conservation workers steady note by
the sees a huge hurdle here hurdle come

327
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:36,860
this way you know they just can't

328
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,630
respond to that at all

329
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,119
put another way

330
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:41,409
these organisms

331
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:47,619
by virtue of agreed individual organisms
art and acquire new responses to

332
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:48,219
stimulus

333
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:52,579
this response pattern has been built-in
byob aleutian it's pretty wired

334
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:57,310
and they're not able they're not be able
to modify on this in any way

335
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,669
and then finally

336
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:02,100
there was a little opportunity for trial
and error learning

337
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,490
sea turtles have one shot at the ocean

338
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,800
if they make it ok now might they might
be eaten by a shark or something but

339
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,149
that's another matter but if they don't
make it they don't have any mechanism

340
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:16,530
for turning around and say opt must go
the other way

341
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:21,030
now there's a fence here are some they
have no way of all of acquiring all of

342
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,690
those businessman response

343
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,170
know what no opportunity for trial order
learning

344
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,640
the pattern has to work the first time

345
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,740
the individual

346
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:36,740
isn't going to make it there was a
question here

347
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,870
yall yes ten evolution change the
response yes evolution can change the

348
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,220
response

349
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,270
but not for the individual

350
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,600
okay aid not for the individual

351
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,629
and b

352
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:54,940
not for the species are either accept or
breaks to really long periods of time

353
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,170
so you can imagine that

354
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:01,430
although maybe the light reflected from
the moon is a different kind of light

355
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,970
than the light that comes from the
incandescent bulbs with oil refinery or

356
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,870
a hotel okay

357
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,329
and you can imagine

358
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:09,710
that over

359
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,600
hugely long periods of time

360
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,910
that there is another variation that the
sea turtles of respond to moonlight will

361
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,510
live

362
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,750
and sea turtles the response of casino
lightbulbs lip

363
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,180
but they

364
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,970
that assumes that there were in such

365
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,020
behavioral variability

366
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,800
and b

367
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,260
that assumes that the species will last
long enough

368
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,220
for evolution

369
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:32,980
to habits

370
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,530
that that the pic its a fact

371
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,289
we're chillin species everyday

372
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:38,360
by virtue of environmental change

373
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,249
what's the big news besides the iraq war

374
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,520
but polar bears

375
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,240
we're going to see the last polar bear
in the wild in about thirty years of or

376
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,370
not careful

377
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,639
because their environment is changing

378
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,660
and there is out

379
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,700
there's not enough time left over for
barrister discover a taste for bamboo

380
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,920
shoots or whatever it is that they're
going to

381
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,870
i'll have to live on

382
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,700
these instinctual behaviors these fixed
action patterns are very very very

383
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,440
powerful and they're very very important

384
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,459
for n_p_r_ adaptation of the art of the
species to which the bargain

385
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,740
but in addition

386
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,569
to these instinctual behavior patterns
built-in by evolution

387
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,789
we need to have a mechanism

388
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:26,630
for individuals for individual species
members

389
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,260
tomato fly their responses

390
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,510
the stimulation

391
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,100
and that is what happens

392
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,880
by virtue

393
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,000
learning

394
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,650
traditionally

395
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,729
will revise this definition later

396
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:42,110
but traditionally redefine learning as a
relatively permanent

397
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,090
change in behavior

398
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,360
errors as a result of experience

399
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,230
or relatively permanent

400
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,370
change in behavior

401
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,150
that occurs as a result of experience

402
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,049
this definition is intended

403
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:57,610
to eliminate

404
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,720
changes in behavior that occur from the
ingestion of drugs

405
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,450
take some psychoactive drugs or
something i might change your behavior

406
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,660
but that's not learning

407
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,659
change of behavior

408
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:12,010
that occurs as a result of injury if you
injure your leg and you can't run that's

409
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,500
not learning it's a change in behavior
but style learning and also

410
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,000
on changes in behavior darker just by
virtue of naturally shin

411
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,650
uh... we brutal with those in our own

412
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,410
or definition of learning

413
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,420
all but

414
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,309
all again

415
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,970
there's a change in behavior that
occurred as as a result of experience

416
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,789
all organisms that have nervous system

417
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:39,400
have at least on capacity to to learn

418
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,250
all laureate learning is especially
important invertebrate

419
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,820
organisms that is organisms that have a
spinal cord and of course it's

420
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,529
especially important

421
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:49,430
and off

422
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,770
in mammalian species and primate species
like ours

423
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,299
but what kab whatever kind of species
you are

424
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,790
if you've got a capacity to learn

425
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,840
learning permits the individual organism

426
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,480
to acquire

427
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,680
behaviors

428
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,850
under new

429
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,490
circumstances

430
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,889
and allows individual organisms

431
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,470
to ad

432
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,530
behavioral responses

433
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,340
to the environment to whatever
repertoire of stimulus response

434
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,970
or associations

435
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,350
has been given them

436
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,680
by alarmed by evolution

437
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,820
okay so we're not gonna to actually talk
about learning formally

438
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,010
but if they're in equal or questions
about these instinctual behavior is the

439
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,720
zone

440
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,720
fixed action patterns would be happy to
take 'em now anything at all

441
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,190
know the charles to do the turtles come
on daytime no they don't

442
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,490
on the reason they don't is it's too hot

443
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,590
there also responding to

444
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,710
changes in ambient temperature

445
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,130
so it's gonna be

446
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,660
below a particular temperature

447
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,659
and then there's gotta be some

448
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:59,000
light out of a band that if there is

449
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
then they start coming out of their nest
but there's gotta be some kind of light

450
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,330
and fortunately

451
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,010
there's almost always

452
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:09,480
some kind of moonlight being reflected
on the sea

453
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,089
reports but once a while you might get a
new moon

454
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:13,490
that's really weak

455
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,380
or lunar eclipse or something like that

456
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,610
by a large it's a pretty good mechanism

457
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,880
very good ya evolution is a very smart
in this way it shape this behaviors of

458
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,890
the animals get to the sea

459
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,810
very good cute of where the c_e_o_s

460
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,230
uh... but it's just not so good anymore

461
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,720
because of these kinds of changes

462
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,720
anything else about these fix action
patterns yes

463
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,660
do humans have any positive

464
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,140
or any kind of taxes at all

465
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:54,480
we might

466
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,390
probably dole

467
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,860
really

468
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,020
notice

469
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,600
our behavior is covered by lots of other
kinds of processes

470
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,670
or where you see them isn't
invertebrates

471
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,130
well that really

472
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,320
let's be honest ok about an anti moth
person but most don't do much else

473
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,150
except fly toward white

474
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,240
and so you can have noticed that

475
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,910
calm

476
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,330
cockroaches okay

477
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,600
cockroaches have what looks like a
negative photo taxes you'd walk into

478
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,800
your

479
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,669
friend's apartment or something like
that eternal light cockroaches scurry on

480
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:31,559
art that's what they're bill to do and
date prev pretty much don't do anything

481
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,790
else except

482
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:39,790
the and run away from late

483
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,990
that what it what but believes the adult
sea turtles to do what they do adds

484
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,950
another instinct entirely

485
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,570
alm

486
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,950
when they're ready to to too

487
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,280
dot drop the regs they come up

488
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,750
on and our it's interesting that

489
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,789
p_p_o_'s b uh... female sea turtle will
calm above the title bout the high tide

490
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,900
line

491
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,750
because of you

492
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,590
two-year-old nest below the tide line
weld the eggs are going to get washed

493
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:14,190
away so that's another behavior that's
been shaped by your pollution

494
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,419
generation after generation after
generation of female sea turtles

495
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:22,260
the ones that laid their legs of the lay
their eggs above the high tide line

496
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,889
their progeny survived

497
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:27,500
and they had a tendency to lay their
eggs about the high timeline

498
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,039
arms as well to kazakhs are the same
thing gritty use that example

499
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,090
except that polite example loves me talk
about

500
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,140
environment change

501
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,850
and there are lots of these instincts if
you want to really wonderful

502
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,389
all of the read some time

503
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:44,649
look at nico ten bergen's book the study
of instinct that's autor effect pockets

504
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:46,090
real theft of reading

505
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:53,090
yes quick

506
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:58,290
all can you learn from and yes you can
learn from injury of course you can

507
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,550
learn from injury you stick your toe
hand an electrical socket you don't do

508
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,710
that twice

509
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,529
but what we're talking about here is

510
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:10,039
injury can produce changes in behavior

511
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,330
like a bite

512
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,010
stomp on your foot you've got a limp
around for a while

513
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,630
but the fact that you've got changed
your behavior that's not learning that's

514
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,210
just

515
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,590
the fact that you were injured

516
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,880
we're looking at morning

517
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,470
relatively permanent change of behavior
that occurs as a result of experience

518
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,920
not get a good idea but what i'm talking
about

519
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,650
when i talk about this first form of
learning known as classical conditioning

520
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,010
ok let's go right there

521
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,330
on and

522
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,680
early forward one form of learning
accidentally discovered by a russian

523
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,210
physiologist named yvonne pablo

524
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:47,470
who was studying the physiology of the
digestive system and dogs

525
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:52,130
this is work for which pavlov won the
young or old price in physiology and

526
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:52,980
medicine

527
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,049
and his technique was quite simple

528
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:58,700
he's confine the dog in this harness so
it could move around

529
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,620
he inserted a fistula little played into
the alm

530
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,320
uh... into the mouth of the dogma
collects elevation

531
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,590
and then they would introduce argue
would introduce into the mouth of the

532
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,080
dog

533
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,660
our drive me powder

534
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,300
on iseries as a result of

535
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,730
reese reflexive response to which the
dog would salivate celebration is a

536
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,379
reflexive response to the introduction
of dry food into are

537
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,510
well into the mouth

538
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,090
and that's what pavlov was studying

539
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,769
initially pavlov's dogs celebrated

540
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,060
all leave when

541
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,110
the powder was actually placed in their
mouth

542
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,790
but as the experiments went on

543
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:41,220
pavlov noticed that his dogs would start
celebrating before the pollard was

544
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,830
presented

545
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,299
they start celebrating just to the site

546
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:45,780
of the powder

547
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,210
then they'd starts elevating just to the
site of the experimenter

548
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,249
eventually they'd start celebrating

549
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:55,409
to the sound of the experimenter coming
down the hall

550
00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:56,660
ought to start on

551
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,610
to start the experiment

552
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,059
dos y_ was what pavlov observed

553
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:03,080
was that this

554
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,299
reflexive response the stimulation

555
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:07,620
was also starting to occur

556
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,420
in response to a bands that were in some
way of sociated

557
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,039
with the delivery of food

558
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,500
the site of food the side of the
experimenter the sound of the

559
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,100
experimenter and so on

560
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,539
pavlov

561
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:21,129
we called these

562
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:21,890
psychic

563
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,060
reflexes which he didn't mean psychics
like you know

564
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,580
psychics in the yellow pages

565
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,869
but he simply meant

566
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:33,610
that this was a reflex that occurred to
be idea

567
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,320
of the stimulus

568
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,080
remember how we define reflexes and
uh... and and instance before that the

569
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,559
stimulus has to be physically present in
the environment

570
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,920
pavlov discovered

571
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,539
sometimes the stimulus doesn't have to
be physically present in the environment

572
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,059
the atom of the organism

573
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:53,580
will all respond

574
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,639
simply to the idea of of the stimulus

575
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,789
and it's the idea of the stimulus that
will blow

576
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:01,240
a reflexive

577
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:01,970
responds

578
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,700
this is the basic procedure

579
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,970
for what is now known as classical
conditioning that's pavlov and lots and

580
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,520
lots and lots of other people

581
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,110
on have studied it

582
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,890
so what will happen here

583
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:18,100
is that in the first phase of a yard
oven elementary classical conditioning

584
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,240
experiment

585
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,030
the on the experiment levees to stimuli
there'll be a bell there'll be some food

586
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,230
and its perimeter will ring the bell

587
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:30,500
them ring the bell again and maybe put
some food a dog smoke ring the bell

588
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,330
again

589
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,230
maybe bring the bell again put some food
the door as well

590
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,330
all of the just kind of

591
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,110
going off randomly

592
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,370
then in phase two of the experiment

593
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,090
the situation changes so that the
ringing of the battle

594
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,409
is always followed immediately within a
couple seconds

595
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:50,210
by

596
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,360
presentation of food

597
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,490
to the most of of them of the animal the
dog

598
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,809
and you do that for a number of trials

599
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:02,419
and then in phase three you take the
food away into entirely

600
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:03,600
and you just present

601
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,769
the bell and what pavlov discovered

602
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:08,649
was that on

603
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:10,889
early trials here in phase two

604
00:27:10,889 --> 00:27:13,460
or where the bell is followed by the
food

605
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:19,420
not too much celebration occurred but
gradually the animal came to salivate

606
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,050
too

607
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:25,080
ringing all of the bell so that in phase
three of past royal

608
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,009
your present the bell alone and the
analysts elevating as if rude

609
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:31,470
had been presented or two

610
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,940
org in its mouth

611
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,710
this is the procedure of classical
conditioning

612
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,450
where the ringing a bell

613
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,990
a stimulus that did not

614
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,340
originally elicit any kind of salvation

615
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,410
comes to elicit

616
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,870
the salivary response

617
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,970
like young

618
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,790
just like the me poner o would have
itself

619
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,519
so this procedure now

620
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,730
illustrates basic vocabulary of
classical conditioning which consists

621
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,350
of

622
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,100
four terms

623
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,070
first with have

624
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,990
the on conditioned stimulus

625
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:12,779
youn conditions stimulus is a stimulus
that reliably evokes

626
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:13,980
summary flex

627
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,710
on apart

628
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:17,110
the organism

629
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,880
on condition stimulus

630
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,340
and environmental event a stimulus

631
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:26,020
that reliably evokes or reflex on the
part of the organism

632
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,780
presenting drive me powder in the mouth
of a dog

633
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,070
evokes elevation of the reflex

634
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,590
tapping my patellar tendon

635
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,799
reliably evokes

636
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,130
a knee-jerk

637
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:37,960
reflex

638
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,010
putting bob

639
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,880
putting up off of on air

640
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,559
i get on the cornea of my life

641
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,790
reliably evokes

642
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,380
untie blink reflects so that's the
unconditional staples

643
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,940
the other conditioned response

644
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,280
is dot reflex

645
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,490
that's real liable evoked by

646
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,360
the on conditions stimulus

647
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,740
the celebration

648
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,990
kneejerk response

649
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,360
the idol inc

650
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,070
okay so the unconditionally sponsor is
the reflex itself

651
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,350
the young conditions stimulus is the
event the stimulus event

652
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,390
that elicits

653
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,929
that reflects

654
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:17,770
then we have the condition stimulus

655
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,950
does not

656
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,490
in another itself

657
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,259
you listed any reflex on the part of the
organism

658
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:26,230
if you ring a bell

659
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,880
alm i don't celebrate

660
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,140
ordinarily

661
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,889
on by

662
00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:35,150
me doesn't jerk ordinarily my idols and
blanco orderly just blows in

663
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,420
had any effect

664
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,039
on my behavior

665
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,110
if you repeatedly pair

666
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,670
the condition stimulus with the un
conditions stimulus

667
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,360
bail

668
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,820
welll

669
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,399
bell

670
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:54,570
then what will happen is a precondition
stimulus the bell will come to a vocal

671
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,250
eight conditioned response likes
elevation

672
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,420
that in some respects

673
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:00,940
resembles

674
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,890
the on condition response

675
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,299
so what happens now is that the
conditioned response is the response

676
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:11,050
that's evoked by the condition stimulus

677
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,190
after many parents with the un
conditions stimulus

678
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,400
and it's a response

679
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,170
the condition response

680
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,130
usually

681
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:21,530
resembles the unconditional response
doesn't have to

682
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,969
it usually does so that's the basic
vocabulary

683
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:26,520
of classical conditioning

684
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,179
and we can use this basic vocabulary now

685
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:31,080
to work our way through

686
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,540
on some of the on major phenomenal

687
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,669
the first phenomenon of classical
condition one we want to talk about

688
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:41,700
is acquisition

689
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,540
acquisition is the process

690
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,490
by which

691
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,750
air-conditioned stimulus

692
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,160
acquires the power

693
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,130
to a bloke

694
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,970
are conditioned response

695
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,360
the process by which

696
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,350
a condition stimulus acquires the power

697
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,200
to a vote

698
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,659
air conditioned response

699
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:00,720
this happens

700
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,320
by virtue of what's known as
reinforcement

701
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,659
reinforcement which in classical
conditioning

702
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:13,340
simply means the pairing of eight
condition stimulus with a non condition

703
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,340
stimulus

704
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,740
carried a bell food

705
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,830
bell food

706
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,750
dole food

707
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,720
bill from

708
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,870
over and over again

709
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:25,720
the bill will come to elicit sell a very
alone some kind of celebrant response

710
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,650
in general

711
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,640
we measure the although

712
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,170
acquisition

713
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,860
other conditioned response in terms of
its strength

714
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,059
and there are two

715
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:39,990
big measures of strength here one is the
magnitude of the condition response

716
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,159
how many drops of saliva

717
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,270
does the animal

718
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,059
in response to the bell

719
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:53,940
on initial trials not much later trials
lots and lots

720
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,210
condition response is growing in
strength

721
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,610
or we can simply

722
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,950
measure the strength of the condition
response in terms of the probability

723
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,389
that the animal will give up

724
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:04,919
the condition response

725
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:08,240
that is the probability that the dog
will celebrate

726
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,820
bomb at all

727
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,650
though that's the acquisition

728
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,909
phase of the kind of goes like that

729
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:16,080
on the first trial of acquisition

730
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,239
we might

731
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:17,509
present

732
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:20,490
a condition stimulus a bell

733
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,370
that rings for a while

734
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,570
and then although that's a little bit
after the onset of the bell

735
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,080
we preserve food

736
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,589
into the most

737
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:30,770
of the of 'em

738
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,049
of the organism

739
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:35,990
and what you can see it here this is the
very first trial of acquisition

740
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,320
the animal doesn't respond

741
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,220
when the bell comes on

742
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,130
bike does begin to respond

743
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,129
as soon as the food is presented

744
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,020
this is the reflexive

745
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,059
response to salvation on trial one

746
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:50,230
there is no

747
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:50,990
as yet

748
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,560
no response to the bell

749
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,010
then couple more trials ten more trials
maybe

750
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:01,660
the condition stimulus comes on little
bit later second or two later

751
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,669
the food is presented to the mouth of
the dog

752
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:05,679
but notice

753
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,170
that now the animal is beginning to
celebrate

754
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,409
after the bell starts ringing

755
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:14,020
but before the food is presented

756
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,289
this is

757
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:19,789
first appearance of a conditioned
response a response to the conditions

758
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,570
stimulus

759
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,000
the on condition stimulus

760
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,789
and then

761
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:26,210
carousel

762
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,899
for some more trials maybe twenty trials
now you can see

763
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:31,600
the animal is

764
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,750
emailing the conditioned response

765
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,650
immediately after

766
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:39,730
the onset of the condition stimulus long
before long in these terms

767
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,570
long before the do you know the food has
been given

768
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,290
the acquisition of a conditioned
response

769
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:45,879
looks

770
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:46,820
pretty much

771
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,600
like that on the first trial

772
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,040
nothing happens

773
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,830
as trials go on

774
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,799
pairing of the condition stimulus in the
on condition stimulus bill food bell

775
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,160
food bell food

776
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,009
then the will start

777
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:03,400
responding to the bell as if it were
flute

778
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,690
responding to the bell

779
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,980
because it's been sociated

780
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,000
there is a typical pattern for the
acquisition

781
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,270
all of a

782
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,260
conditioned response

783
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,299
here we have number of trials

784
00:34:16,299 --> 00:34:19,379
here we plotted the probability

785
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,730
soliciting the condition response
celebration or whatever

786
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,280
on early trials not much

787
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,369
conditioned response

788
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:29,379
gradually

789
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:31,219
pru reinforcement

790
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,279
condition stimulus acquires

791
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,549
a lot of strength

792
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:37,650
to elicit the are the condition response

793
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,160
this is acquisition by virtue of the
pairing

794
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,700
of the condition stimulus

795
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,189
the bell

796
00:34:43,189 --> 00:34:45,739
the on condition stimulus

797
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,969
response

798
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:51,619
so that's what the experts what the
acquisition phase looks like

799
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:52,689
in acquisition

800
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:58,029
the condition stimulus acquires the
power to a poker conditioned response

801
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,300
an extension

802
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,359
the condition stimulus

803
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,090
loses

804
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:05,069
the power to evoke

805
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:06,269
conditioned response

806
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:07,389
and it does so

807
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:14,019
by virtue of the lack of reinforcement
now what we do is we disconnect

808
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:15,049
link between

809
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:19,560
the c_s_ and the u_s_ the link between
the bell and the food

810
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,499
so that now

811
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:26,839
the bells presented but the food stop
presented anymore

812
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:27,949
bell nothing

813
00:35:27,949 --> 00:35:30,079
and what happens is

814
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,779
conditioned response eventually lose
that strength you have a question over

815
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:34,190
here

816
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,519
ol okay

817
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:38,930
well let's see how that

818
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,169
again on extension trial one

819
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:44,550
first time the bells presented in the
absence of food

820
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:48,409
the out of the doesn't know the
situations change right

821
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:53,229
gives a strong conditioned response

822
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:54,149
after

823
00:35:54,149 --> 00:35:56,509
ten extension trials

824
00:35:56,509 --> 00:35:57,420
condition response

825
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,059
has been weakened ig and we're
presenting the bell but not the food

826
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:03,169
conditioned response has been weakened

827
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:04,599
and

828
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:06,730
after some more extension trials

829
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:10,079
conditioned response drops out entirely

830
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:10,469
here's

831
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:11,860
the pattern

832
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,509
typical pattern by which

833
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:16,430
on extension occurs and you see it

834
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:23,430
pretty much the mirror image of of
acquisition on early trials

835
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,819
condition responses very strong and then

836
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:30,719
gradually weakens loses most of the
strength early

837
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,849
of the

838
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:32,900
early an extension

839
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,360
and then as extinction trials are
carried on

840
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,249
it drops back through zero for at least
fact before

841
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:40,790
acquisition

842
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,729
by virtue of reinforcement

843
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:47,950
the condition stimulus acquires the
power to elicit a conditioned response

844
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,450
extension

845
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,990
by virtue of the lack of reinforcement

846
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,749
the condition stimulus

847
00:36:52,749 --> 00:36:54,189
loses

848
00:36:54,189 --> 00:36:54,890
seem

849
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,269
kind of power

850
00:36:57,269 --> 00:37:00,009
it lou that in a funny way

851
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:04,209
if an animal acquires a condition
response through reinforcement in the

852
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:05,609
acquisition phase

853
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:06,569
and then

854
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:10,269
that that condition response
disappearance during extinction

855
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:14,189
if you take the animal out of the test
apparatus pointed put it in its home

856
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:15,729
page for a while

857
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:18,570
and then bring it back into the test
apparatus

858
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,329
and just presented with a condition
stimulus just ring the bell

859
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:23,509
what you're going to see

860
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:26,260
is some spontaneous recovery

861
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,209
all of the conditioned response

862
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:31,749
so if you get the animal some rest after
extension

863
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,869
and then a retested with a condition
stimulus alone

864
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:36,400
you will see

865
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,609
some degree

866
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:40,430
condition response been given

867
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,299
so that's what we mean by spontaneous
recovery

868
00:37:43,299 --> 00:37:45,940
there haven't been many new acquisition
trials

869
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,690
there been known in trials in which the
s_ and u_s_ have been paired with each

870
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,220
other

871
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,959
it's just that

872
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:58,690
are conditioned response spontaneously
recovers after only

873
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,439
and so here we go

874
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:02,649
here's the acquisition phase

875
00:38:02,649 --> 00:38:05,660
the conditioned response growing in
strength

876
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,619
here is the expansion phase

877
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,269
the condition response

878
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:10,749
bruises strength

879
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:13,479
now we have an interval of rest

880
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:14,309
we test

881
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:15,950
the condition response again

882
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,279
and we see that

883
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:19,719
there is some strength there

884
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:23,729
and now for karaoke further extension
trials

885
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:26,209
the are conditioned response will again

886
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:27,119
go back

887
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,119
ought to uh... to baselines what's known
as spontaneous recovery

888
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,299
and spontaneous recovery is itself

889
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:35,720
to extinction

890
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,729
you can just keep carrying out

891
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:38,670
these extinction

892
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:42,619
uh... trials

893
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,059
the next

894
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:46,709
off phenomenon that we look at

895
00:38:46,709 --> 00:38:49,909
diary acquisition of the conditioned
response

896
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:53,639
after you've extinguisher condition
response by taking away the

897
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,279
reinforcement

898
00:38:55,279 --> 00:39:00,129
if you start reinforcing the conditions
stimulus again by pairing it with the un

899
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,050
conditions stimulus

900
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,559
bell food health food

901
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,539
health food

902
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:04,780
then what will happen

903
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,480
is that

904
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,329
the animal

905
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:08,920
will start showing the condition
response

906
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,999
all over again okay the condition
response will grow in strength

907
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:14,900
but what's interesting about this

908
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,859
is that on ac was there are no react was
ish in trials

909
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:22,149
when the c_s_ is once again paired with
the u_s_

910
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:26,669
the adult will condition up again but
what condition faster

911
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:29,879
than it did onion itial trials

912
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:31,890
even though the response was
extinguished

913
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:35,629
the animal will relearn the conditioned
response

914
00:39:35,629 --> 00:39:38,220
faster on subsequent blog trials

915
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,290
than it did on the initial trial

916
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:45,809
this is a phenomenon known as savings
and in relearning

917
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:47,319
spontaneous recovery

918
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:49,839
and savings and rewarding

919
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,260
revealed through important of barber
tuneful

920
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:53,900
features

921
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,039
that reveals something very important
about extension

922
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,359
and that is

923
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:01,469
conditioned response

924
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:03,720
isn't really lost

925
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,189
during extinction

926
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:06,690
it's not forgotten

927
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,929
it's not as if it member was their
arcade

928
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:10,919
it's bare

929
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:14,939
the animal still has the capacity to
make the association between c_e_o_'s

930
00:40:14,939 --> 00:40:16,049
and u_s_

931
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:17,920
all otherwise it wouldn't

932
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,999
we learn it

933
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:19,839
of faster

934
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,090
the second time around

935
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:28,090
at a question back here

936
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,700
if you do this if you do this over and
over and over again the animal doesn't

937
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,109
get confused it's a very good question
beneath the i will certainly what's

938
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:41,239
going on here

939
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:45,259
reasons of all talk about next wednesday
okay

940
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:45,789
on

941
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:48,190
that's not exactly what happens what
happens is

942
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,229
at with the way i do when you repeat the
cycle

943
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:52,599
the animals catch on

944
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:54,479
more and more quickly

945
00:40:54,479 --> 00:40:55,409
sold out

946
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:58,099
let's go back here for a second

947
00:40:58,099 --> 00:40:59,190
so that

948
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,849
if u

949
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:02,490
repeat the acquisition phase

950
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,640
the animal shows savings in relearning

951
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,149
it says all ok bells followed by food
now so i'm going to start salivating

952
00:41:10,149 --> 00:41:12,599
than when you repeat the expansion phase

953
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,749
the animal extinguishers more clearly

954
00:41:15,749 --> 00:41:18,740
it shows savings in extinction if you
will

955
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,640
the animals that out okay

956
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,619
bell doesn't

957
00:41:21,619 --> 00:41:23,630
is an associate with food anymore

958
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,049
on so i won't celebrate

959
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,599
and that's not what the animals actually
saying but

960
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,469
that were africa more flies in here for
purposes of the discussion and then when

961
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:33,519
you turn the connection back on

962
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,619
the animal will catch on to that
immediately

963
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,819
so do you get lots of savings in
rewarding

964
00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:42,119
and you get lots of savings an
acquisition

965
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:43,680
the animal will

966
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,210
adjust its response

967
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,699
very very finally

968
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:50,309
to what's happening around okay

969
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:53,620
bell and food or associated now so i'm
going to celebrate

970
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,609
alright fell into a darn associated more
so i won't solve it

971
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:58,539
and that basically works like that

972
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:01,769
there are ways to confused animals with
procedures like this

973
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,080
but we're not going to talk about those
today

974
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:10,509
quick question yes

975
00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:15,639
does it depend on how old the animal is
hidden doesn't really depend

976
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:16,589
no

977
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:19,550
baby animals can show classical
conditioning

978
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,189
infantrymen skin shock classical
conditioning

979
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:22,889
on

980
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:28,169
on its supposed all

981
00:42:28,169 --> 00:42:32,219
teacher who did classical conditioning
experiments with college students

982
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:32,900
volun

983
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,729
and under those circumstances of college
students can just think too much

984
00:42:36,729 --> 00:42:40,079
about the situation the usually screw up
these experiments

985
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:40,839
on

986
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:44,229
but the on and always doesn't really
matter

987
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:45,930
doesn't really matter

988
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,259
as long as the organism is capable of

989
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:50,669
sensing

990
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:51,779
stimuli

991
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:54,799
and performing the response

992
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:58,600
really doesn't matter this is a very
very very elementary form of learning

993
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,869
and it's widely available

994
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:05,369
fall so what else we have to say here
okay

995
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:07,799
so we've done

996
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:08,720
acquisition okay

997
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,440
here's savings and relearning

998
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,650
youbet acquired a response extinguish
the response

999
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,890
there's been some rest little
spontaneous recovery now you put the

1000
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:21,769
animal on reinforcements goggan schedule
again

1001
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:24,739
the animal was shows savings and
rewarding

1002
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:27,089
re acquired the response

1003
00:43:27,089 --> 00:43:28,739
faster

1004
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,220
acquired it

1005
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,169
first-time

1006
00:43:32,169 --> 00:43:33,179
so thats

1007
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:37,540
the point here that condition responses
are lost during extinction

1008
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,499
cuz they come back became a comeback
faster

1009
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:46,929
here is another phenomena content finish
this of beef before our time

1010
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:47,869
generalization

1011
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:49,999
all-day condition response

1012
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:54,160
once a conditioned response has been
established

1013
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,449
then all you can

1014
00:43:56,449 --> 00:44:00,190
transferee if you will that condition
response to other stimuli

1015
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,009
what will happen is

1016
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:04,139
once a condition response is established

1017
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:06,609
the animal will also give

1018
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:10,659
the condition response to all other
stimuli and the environment

1019
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:11,160
provided

1020
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,299
that they are similar

1021
00:44:13,299 --> 00:44:14,909
to the stimulus

1022
00:44:14,909 --> 00:44:17,920
to which the animal was originally

1023
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,499
condition

1024
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:21,849
this is what's known as the
generalization

1025
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:22,539
gradient

1026
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:24,479
here is an illustration of it

1027
00:44:24,479 --> 00:44:25,829
we

1028
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,309
badge in the reconditioned

1029
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:28,190
an animal

1030
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,749
to a tone of about six hundred fifty
cycles per second

1031
00:44:32,749 --> 00:44:34,910
frequency

1032
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:38,059
and then tested the animals response

1033
00:44:38,059 --> 00:44:39,559
lower tones

1034
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:40,629
and two

1035
00:44:40,629 --> 00:44:41,550
higher

1036
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,709
frequency tomes

1037
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:43,980
what will find

1038
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,299
is that the adl responds best today tone
to which it was over

1039
00:44:49,299 --> 00:44:50,529
emission we condition

1040
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:53,670
but it will also respond pretty well

1041
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,180
two tones that are close to the original
tone

1042
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,380
in frequency

1043
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,649
and there's a

1044
00:45:00,649 --> 00:45:01,539
progressive

1045
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:03,069
drop-off in response

1046
00:45:03,069 --> 00:45:07,449
as the test phones all become more and
more dissimilar

1047
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:09,249
so the generalization gradient

1048
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:11,630
is a gradient are

1049
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:12,629
similarity

1050
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:14,690
between protest stimulus

1051
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:20,269
and the original condition stimulus and
the idea behind generalization

1052
00:45:20,269 --> 00:45:25,589
the more test stimulus resembles the
original c_e_o_s

1053
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,939
more conditioned response you'll get

1054
00:45:27,939 --> 00:45:31,019
the more dissimilar but estimate was his

1055
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,579
to the original c_e_o_s

1056
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:33,419
the less

1057
00:45:33,419 --> 00:45:36,920
of a condition response

1058
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,450
finally

1059
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:39,379
we have

1060
00:45:39,379 --> 00:45:42,009
phenomenon known as discrimination

1061
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:44,759
which of the which show

1062
00:45:44,759 --> 00:45:46,490
accounts for the essentially a check

1063
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,879
on on generalization

1064
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:52,469
here what happens is we take one
condition stimulus

1065
00:45:52,469 --> 00:45:53,189
say

1066
00:45:53,189 --> 00:45:57,630
or bella lago particular frequency

1067
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,169
reinforce tab with food

1068
00:45:59,169 --> 00:46:00,689
heiko

1069
00:46:00,689 --> 00:46:05,740
ido food and i'm not a rebel with
another frequented mobile okay

1070
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,140
and we don't waitin four seven four

1071
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,420
ido food

1072
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:09,999
mobile

1073
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:11,289
no fool

1074
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:12,429
what will happen is

1075
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:16,789
the animal will come to make a
discriminative response so that it gives

1076
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:18,760
those conditioned response

1077
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,640
oli too

1078
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,269
be condition stimulus which has been
been reinforced

1079
00:46:23,269 --> 00:46:26,429
and it won't get the conditioned uh...
response

1080
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:29,769
to the stem condition stimulus that's
not reinforced

1081
00:46:29,769 --> 00:46:33,069
here is a schematic of what

1082
00:46:33,069 --> 00:46:37,329
discrimination learning looks like

1083
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:41,249
condition the animal for awhile okay

1084
00:46:41,249 --> 00:46:43,499
five hundred cycle per second

1085
00:46:43,499 --> 00:46:45,369
is ul paired with food

1086
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:49,259
the to under fifty cycle per second
bills not paired off with food

1087
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:52,969
for a short while the animal just
responds the bells

1088
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:59,019
but pretty soon it begins to make the
discrimination

1089
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:02,950
response to the reinforced m ellis with
the reinforced so yes

1090
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:05,079
continues to grow in strength

1091
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:07,759
the response to the or unreinforced

1092
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:08,819
two years

1093
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:09,650
draws

1094
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,869
that threat drops out

1095
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,660
this is essentially extension

1096
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,439
this is essentially acquisition

1097
00:47:15,439 --> 00:47:18,059
this is expected essentially extinction

1098
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:19,980
so what happens now

1099
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,969
is that

1100
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:23,699
by virtue of

1101
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:29,880
these basic prophecies ok acquisition
generalization

1102
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,830
discrimination

1103
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:33,210
stimuli calm to revoke

1104
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,179
and inhibit conditioned responses

1105
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:37,910
even though they themselves

1106
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:41,049
have not necessarily been associated

1107
00:47:41,049 --> 00:47:43,760
the uh... with the conditions stimulus
okay

1108
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,619
so that's what's going on in eleven
classical conditioning

1109
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:50,139
by means

1110
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:54,469
by means of classical conditioning
processes in general what happens it

1111
00:47:54,469 --> 00:47:57,119
said a reflexive behaviors

1112
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,089
come under the control of environmental
been events

1113
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:08,099
classical conditioning phenomenal art
ubiquitous in nature basically any

1114
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:10,080
organism that's got a nervous system

1115
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,650
will show at least from of the
phenomenon

1116
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:18,969
classical conditioning they may not show
them all but they'll show at least song

1117
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:21,009
in each of these cases

1118
00:48:21,009 --> 00:48:25,739
were xd in control over reflexes to
other environmental events i start

1119
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:31,669
giving the patellar reflex to the sound
of a bell instead of just the blow of a

1120
00:48:31,669 --> 00:48:33,439
hammer

1121
00:48:33,439 --> 00:48:39,539
pavlov believed that all forms of
learning where basically on on variants

1122
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:44,679
on classical conditioning we now know
that that is too extreme

1123
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:48,719
but we do understand now that to a very
large extent

1124
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:55,219
the laws of classical conditioning are
the lawyers of our emotional lives

1125
00:48:55,219 --> 00:49:00,839
by virtue processes like classical
conditioning we acquire

1126
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,239
our fears

1127
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:03,640
or a versions

1128
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,200
our joys our preferences the things that
make us happy

1129
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,179
the things that make a sad the things
that make us afraid

1130
00:49:13,179 --> 00:49:18,489
some of those things make us that way
innately of most of them make us that

1131
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:23,149
way because we have learned to respond
that way to these events we've learned

1132
00:49:23,149 --> 00:49:28,959
to respond that way to these events by
virtue of a process very similar to what

1133
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:32,479
pavlov's studied as classical
conditioning

1134
00:49:32,479 --> 00:49:34,919
thank you very much have a good weekend
i'll see you monday
