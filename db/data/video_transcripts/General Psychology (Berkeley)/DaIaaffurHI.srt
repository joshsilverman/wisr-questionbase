1
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,869
one more reminder

2
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:14,320
that there is an exam in this class next
week first midterm next wednesday

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,779
there'll be a review and class on monday
by the geo size

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:19,029
palm

5
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:23,819
i think i've got all the disability
deduct the s_p_ starcom additions

6
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:24,680
you know

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,970
if i haven't

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,019
act fast because we have to make
arrangements for you

9
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,159
home

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,269
okay are just a reminder of the coverage
everything from the beginning of the

11
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,579
course until

12
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,990
the end of business

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,790
today

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,760
lots of resources for our ball for the
exam on the course website

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,000
go to the court's website click on exam
information in the uh... in the

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,760
navigation bar

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,370
and you'll get everything you need if
you have any questions

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,650
poston through the of forum

19
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,790
of the course bulletin board

20
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,510
paul

21
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,250
and will get an answer to you just as
soon as we can

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,510
fifty mobile choice questions computers
scored

23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,940
on roughly half of the lectures roughly
half of the text

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,830
sold bringing you've gotta bring your
own scantron form we don't supply goes

25
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,030
and you've got to bring your own pencils
as well

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,930
and that's what the scantron form looks
like some of you already got it

27
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,670
ones i've seen of the right ones

28
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,670
and there's that

29
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,640
last time i'd focused on what's known as
the ecological view of perception

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,470
all of you know that says that
perception is

31
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,630
simply a matter of

32
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:57,660
extracting information about the distal
stimulus from the proximal stimulus

33
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,020
by which is meant

34
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,490
the entire pattern all proximal
stimulation

35
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,740
that falls on these sensory surfaces of
the art of the pursuit

36
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,079
and i thought was traded oven

37
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:14,660
the ecological view with a young or
run-through

38
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,230
various principles by which

39
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,600
we recover information about depth or
distance the all of the distance between

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,920
all of the distal

41
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,930
stimulus and the perceive ur

42
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,249
and noted that

43
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:27,980
all

44
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,320
there are some cues the distance

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,579
that require

46
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,919
to rise

47
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,409
some the require only one i did

48
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:39,629
some of these cues are ocular in nature
and that they're provided by feedback

49
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,899
from the musculature r_b_i_'s itself

50
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:45,260
and all others are optical in nature

51
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,590
uh... in that they have to do with the
pattern of light

52
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,879
that falls on the retina

53
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,439
these cute

54
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,319
alm

55
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:56,580
relatives sawyer superposition and shot
to win and so on

56
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,629
are sometimes known as pictorial cues

57
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:04,219
because they have been used by artists
these western artists

58
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:07,609
since the time of the renaissance

59
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:11,150
conveying depth or distance three
dimensions

60
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,150
in order to dimensional surfaces like

61
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,370
canvases and

62
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,349
frescoes

63
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:19,049
just to review again

64
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,620
what's going on here is that from the
ecological point of view

65
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,670
all the information that the perceive ur
needs

66
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:32,610
to see objects in depth to perceive
distance is provided by the entire

67
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,129
pattern

68
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,010
are proximal stimulation

69
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,579
that falls on the perceive urs sensory
or systems

70
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,299
and it gives an argued

71
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,430
that over evolutionary time

72
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,819
are perceptual systems evolved

73
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:49,860
to extract just that stimulation that's
relevant

74
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,259
for proceeding

75
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:54,370
motion and so on

76
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,239
so this is a somebody pointed out on the
forum all of this this morning

77
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,799
are kind of nativist

78
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,990
viewer perception

79
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,870
that the perceive ur comes into the
world with all of the equipment that'd

80
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,209
needs to extract this so i kind of
information

81
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,239
it's part of

82
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,400
the procedures innate biological
endowment

83
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,069
doesn't require regular neend requiring
the experience

84
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:22,139
on doesn't require any so-called higher
mental process these involved and

85
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,760
reasoning judgment an inference

86
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,030
like these stimulus response view of
learning

87
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:36,150
he hit the ecological view a perception
is an extremely powerful an extremely

88
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,199
attractive view

89
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,809
this particular cognitive process

90
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:43,820
but like the stimulus response theory of
learning

91
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,389
it is a ltd

92
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:47,580
view all perception

93
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,680
and there are so many important problems
with it

94
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,780
which is what i'm going to devote

95
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,290
today's lecture are true

96
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,719
wherever headed

97
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:59,430
is an alternative you of perception

98
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,419
which is known as the constructivist
view

99
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:09,060
are summarized most aptly by the part of
their psychologist jerome bruner

100
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,380
that this really says

101
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,790
that in perception the perceive ur must
go well beyond the information given by

102
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,559
the stimulus

103
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:21,740
gibson said all that's needed for
perceptions to extract information from

104
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,150
the stimulus

105
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,469
brunner argued that that wasn't enough

106
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:27,879
dot all but you had to do i do

107
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,939
more instantly extract stimulus
information

108
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:35,469
one reason for that is sometimes
stimulus information is just

109
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,840
insufficient for perception

110
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,970
the stimulus does not provide you with
what you need

111
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,399
difficult what it is where it is what
it's doing and saw one

112
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,940
and also sometimes as will see a little
while

113
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,570
stimulus information is misleading

114
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,309
on the august the stimulus information
conveys a

115
00:05:56,309 --> 00:06:02,120
misleading all perception 'em mislead
impression of what the stimulus is like

116
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,699
fred gibson

117
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:07,370
perception is a mechanical process

118
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,570
for rotor perception is an intelligent
process

119
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,869
that requires that the

120
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:14,620
perceive ur

121
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,570
bring to bear on the act of perception

122
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,839
his or her knowledge all of the world

123
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,029
and requires the perceive her to make
various kinds of judgments

124
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:30,990
various kinds of inferences to engage in
the reasoning and problem solving

125
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,079
in an effort to figure out

126
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:37,169
to figure out what it is that is out
there

127
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,169
where it is and what it is

128
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,889
here is an example

129
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:47,579
what some people take to be a limitation
of the ecological view it's a phenomenon

130
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:51,039
known as sides constancy

131
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:51,949
remember

132
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:54,530
from our discussion on monday

133
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,969
besides distance rule

134
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:57,170
that the distance

135
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,180
of an object

136
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,490
to put all of the to the perceive ur

137
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,849
is eight

138
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:03,939
function actually and inverse function

139
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:07,810
of the size of the recall of the retinal
image

140
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,139
cast by that object on the perceive
resolve or on the project receivers

141
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,209
ratna and here's an example of how this
might not work

142
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,860
here as a lawyer in

143
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,509
and it's far away from the alright

144
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:26,499
and when this lawyer and as far away
from the eye it casts a relatively small

145
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:28,819
image on direct mail

146
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,530
here is a wine and that is come closer

147
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,699
to the alright if you will

148
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:35,120
and this lion cast

149
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,549
a march larger image on the retina

150
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:42,110
buck you don't print one of the lion
comes closer to you

151
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,680
you do not perceive it getting this

152
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,650
okay you know it's a wonderful life a
little light and over there

153
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,460
and what do i was a really big lie and
over here you don't do that

154
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,330
you perceive the lion getting closer but
you don't perceive the lion getting

155
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,470
bigger

156
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:04,699
size remains constant perceive size
remains constant despite

157
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:07,120
changes in the size of the retinal image

158
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,910
that occur as a function all of the
object

159
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,479
on the getting closer

160
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,330
so here you have an example

161
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,560
where proximo stimulus is changing

162
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,080
the size of the retinal image is
changing

163
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,280
but the perception is remaining constant

164
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,940
okay

165
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,580
there's a discrepancy between what the
information is

166
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,520
and what the perception

167
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,379
here is of abroad or more abstract
definition

168
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:38,389
of what these perceptual constancy czar
all about

169
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:43,890
and every case of perceptual constancy
dot pattern of proximal stimulation

170
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,600
changes

171
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,769
on in the case of sites constancy the
retinal image gets larger but the

172
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,640
perception of the distal stimulus

173
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,579
the mental representations of the distal
stimulus

174
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:59,399
remains constant the in not the case of
size constancy

175
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,339
the object is perceived as getting all
closer

176
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,549
but it's not perceived

177
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:04,570
i was getting

178
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,500
a larger

179
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,569
the nineteenth century german
psychologist

180
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:11,510
of one helmholtz

181
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,540
all

182
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,470
worried about this problem he said its
exemption

183
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,220
the perceptual system

184
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,640
is making the inferences

185
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,610
okay

186
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,679
on about the size of the distance of the
object

187
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,100
performing certain kinds of calculations

188
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,130
but you're not aware of these
calculations as you're performing them

189
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,670
they're being performed unconsciously

190
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,839
all we can really specify what these
calculations are

191
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,999
we know the lord me by inference

192
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:42,240
but the general idea that helmholtz had

193
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,720
deeply or the person who is going beyond
the information given

194
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,550
by making the inference

195
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,010
that the object is getting closer rather
than growing in size

196
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,820
okay bula compensating for called the
for these up for these distance cues

197
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,699
so here in fact is what really happens

198
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:04,460
you'll never see just a

199
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,610
pw or lion in the distance right

200
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,970
there's always some kind of background

201
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,670
so what happens here is that when they
are when the lion is far away might see

202
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,930
him walking out of a forester something
that's supposed to be a tree

203
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,190
on and the lion in the tree

204
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,860
cast

205
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,190
out an image of one size on the on the
road

206
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,920
here is the lion emerges from the forest
and comes closer to the perceive ur

207
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,390
v_r_ the art of retinal image of the
lion

208
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,070
becomes larger

209
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:41,530
the compound rison between the lion and
the tree route changes

210
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,879
and what's happening is the perceptual
system

211
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:47,389
is taking account of the changed
relationship

212
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:49,550
between the rebel sizable lion

213
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,839
and the retinal slice of the tree up
here

214
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,689
and the rebel sizable lion

215
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:56,370
and the rebels size of the tree here

216
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,489
there's a kind of calculation

217
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:01,580
that the perceptual system or performs

218
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,370
so now we'd see that there are

219
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,510
true kinds of

220
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,459
cubes order if you will to kinds of
information

221
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:10,439
that contribute

222
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:13,060
to the perception of constancy

223
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,300
the first

224
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,820
is

225
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,600
not just the rebels sizable lion you're
looking at but the rebel the size of the

226
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,720
rebel image of everything your looking
that the comparison of the object with

227
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,970
its background

228
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,779
will give you a true picture

229
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:31,779
of whether that's a lot and it's growing
in size

230
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:34,040
world by an that's coming mirror

231
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,610
and if you think about it for a second

232
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,189
the comparison

233
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:39,120
obvi

234
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,610
object with its background

235
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,120
those kinds of unconscious inferences
are actually consistent with the gives

236
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,219
sony in view

237
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:51,619
because what gives them says his that
all the information you need for

238
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:53,180
perception is provided by

239
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,000
the entire pattern

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,420
of stimulation

241
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,970
not just the stimulation the comes from
the object you look at that lion

242
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,260
but also the image that that those
stimulation of columns from the

243
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,830
background of the object

244
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,340
the trees and the far east

245
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,389
but there's also the case

246
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:14,169
and this is what's consistent with the
broder

247
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,459
view of things

248
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,869
that we know something about the size of
trees and we know something about the

249
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:21,810
size of lions

250
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,969
it's this world knowledge

251
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:25,450
that we have

252
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,820
that we apply

253
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,060
when we see when when the when the uh...
when the

254
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,810
rebelled image of the lion gets larger

255
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,370
we know the lions don't suddenly expand
in size

256
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,340
okay we know that about creatures

257
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,779
and so we

258
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,980
take that knowledge about the world

259
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,349
and use that to construct of perception

260
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:50,590
of the of the line as coming closer
rather than

261
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,539
so again

262
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:55,399
we have the rebels size story is
actually consistent with kids and

263
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,639
ecological view

264
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,140
but there's this other story

265
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,110
but knowledge that we have the printer
we bring to bear on the active

266
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,769
perception and that's consistent

267
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:11,769
with the greenery in dubai yes

268
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,590
well the retinal image

269
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,200
of the things that

270
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,650
org of athar are getting bigger that's
right but they but they are not getting

271
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,730
bigger themselves

272
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,290
well for one thing

273
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,500
you know you're moving

274
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,120
okay

275
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,520
'cause you're driving a car or you're
walking or whatever

276
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,960
but again

277
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,480
the the story is the same if you the
perceive er or in motion

278
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,430
okay

279
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,870
the without morpeth the size of the
rebel image cast by the objects that you

280
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,710
are approaching is going to get bigger

281
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,920
but did some would say work

282
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,390
you've got think about the rebel sides
of the object you're approaching

283
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,140
compared to the rebels size of all the
other raj x in the background if you

284
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,490
make that comparison

285
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,530
you don't see the object getting bigger
you see the objects getting closer

286
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,420
bruder would say yeah that's true

287
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,019
but it's also true

288
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,210
that we know about the size of the
trucks we meet on the highway

289
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,989
or when you go to pass up an
eighteen-wheeler

290
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:13,970
the eighteen-wheeler doesn't get bigger

291
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,520
and then get smaller and your rear-view
mirror

292
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,010
your own personal that's a little truck

293
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,520
you say

294
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,890
it's was close to me now it's far away
and because you know the trucks don't

295
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,600
change inside theater

296
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,950
okay so point here for the constant sees
is that there are two different kinds of

297
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,300
principles involved

298
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,370
one is

299
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,570
gives sony in comparison of the object
with its background

300
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,180
okay

301
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,670
the other is

302
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,210
bringing to bear

303
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,160
what you know about the world

304
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,280
as you construct

305
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,329
you are perception of the world

306
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:51,310
let me go on and give you another
example of this

307
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,770
here is shaped constancy

308
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,700
here's a door

309
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,980
which if it's characteristic rectangular
shape

310
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,119
but as the door opens

311
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,010
noticed that the

312
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,279
shape of the door

313
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,640
he calms

314
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,419
more trapezoidal

315
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:09,770
okay

316
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,630
parallel lines become not parallel
anymore

317
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,320
this line becomes longer than this line

318
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,170
that's even more so as the door opens of
even more

319
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,360
but you don't perceive the door is
changing in shape

320
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,360
this is shaped constancy despite changes
in the pattern on stimulation

321
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,049
these square sides

322
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:33,540
to these

323
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,959
angled sides

324
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,020
you don't see

325
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,510
the object as audited as changing in
shape

326
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,480
so here

327
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,240
we have

328
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,340
the first challenge

329
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,510
to the gives sony in view

330
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,259
all the information you need for
perception is provided by the stimulus

331
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:54,560
because here stimulus information is
changing at least to some extent

332
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,959
but the perception

333
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:57,490
is remaining

334
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,130
constant

335
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,180
here is another example

336
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,060
this is a white bonds

337
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,670
against a black background here's the
base

338
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:13,670
here's the stem here is the lip of the
blogs

339
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,600
but then when you look at at what else
do you see

340
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,230
you see some faces here is or farhad

341
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,210
unknowns

342
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,009
lips

343
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,380
chan neck

344
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,029
farhad knows

345
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,920
lips chin and neck

346
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,699
if you look at the white part you see a
vaults

347
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,740
if you look at a black part you see

348
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,500
faces

349
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,440
okay

350
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,269
this is the rueben bwz all ribbon of
baseball as figure

351
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,890
or invented by a guy named

352
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,369
but the point here is

353
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:48,760
that the pattern of stimulation

354
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,940
has remained constant haven't changed
anything up here okay

355
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,579
buck despite the fact

356
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:58,710
but the pattern of stimulation remains
calm

357
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,730
your perception of

358
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,010
the object

359
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,630
ten change

360
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,940
depending on with you look at the white
part

361
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,670
or you look at the black part

362
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,669
you see abbasi against or wapas against
a black background

363
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:12,880
or you see

364
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,560
blacks silhouettes against a white

365
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,199
background

366
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,909
here we begin to see

367
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:19,289
our second

368
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,290
major challenge

369
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,850
the give sony in view of perception

370
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:28,150
this is a figure known as a reversible
figure

371
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,429
reversible figure because the perception
will change

372
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:34,050
reverse figuring ground

373
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,850
you see

374
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,860
to quite

375
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,180
on kinds of

376
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,070
here's another example

377
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,380
that so-called becker cube

378
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,950
but i want to do is just look at it

379
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:52,950
a couple of seconds

380
00:17:53,340 --> 00:18:00,340
people who were way off of the site may
not get the suspect

381
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,410
what's happening

382
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,960
what's happening

383
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,860
yet to different parts pop out ok
sometimes

384
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,710
this corner any seems to be mirror

385
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:21,780
to u and escort p on on the other
occasions this quarter the seems closer

386
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,480
to you

387
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,070
then the corner eight

388
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:31,060
okay so which is nearer to you

389
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,489
the stimulus isn't and off

390
00:18:33,489 --> 00:18:36,120
okay to provide you with this
information

391
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,980
it all depends on how you look at it but
again the point here is

392
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,400
that the pattern of stimulation is
staying constant

393
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,400
but the perception obvi object is
changing

394
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,520
this is another reversible figure
sometimes known as an ambiguous figure

395
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,850
because it's not at all clear

396
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,340
along which of these of features is home

397
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,330
or is in the foreground and which of
them is in the background but it's

398
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:09,060
nothing about the pattern of stimulation
that's causing perception a change okay

399
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,630
perception is changing despite the fact

400
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,660
that the stimulation is remaining
constant

401
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,210
this is a of the figure that you'll find
in uh... in orchard specially medieval

402
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,530
and byzantine art

403
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,140
or it's known as the ought the idea q

404
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,200
this is a war from the admissions son
heavier della bach

405
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,429
fall church in tucson arizona

406
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:34,180
that's all painted like this

407
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,630
it my way since both the eighteenth
century

408
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,260
and again what you can see here

409
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,809
aversion of the neck curriculum

410
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:44,430
so reply flash went off

411
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,060
didn't realize his coat look like that
these before

412
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,780
digital pictures

413
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,080
here's another version

414
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,040
this very much like the nectar cuba's
notices schroeder staircase

415
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,560
set of stairs

416
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,190
and as you look at it

417
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,960
you'll see that your perception of the
set of stairs

418
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,230
reverses

419
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,220
sometimes you see this wall

420
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,550
as closer to you

421
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,940
than this wall

422
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,210
with the spear is going up

423
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,980
ops okay you got sick

424
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,729
now you see

425
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:27,270
this wall is nearer to you but the
stairs kind of

426
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:34,270
it's kinda like the poseidon adventure
or something right

427
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,650
the world turned upside down

428
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,950
again

429
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,640
same thing

430
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,999
you can see this as a buzz that artistic
variant on the schroeder staircase

431
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:50,500
though this was painted long before
schroeder ever

432
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,380
came onto

433
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:59,510
here is a picture of a dim your young
woman with her head turned away from the

434
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,450
perceive our

435
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,250
here is her scarf

436
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,520
her hair she's got a feather your hat

437
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,080
here is her

438
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
over file id

439
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,790
her nose

440
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,950
hurtin

441
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,000
some kind of

442
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,870
a necklace around her

443
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,560
uh... around her neck

444
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,780
very nice picture

445
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,950
or if you can see i kind of a craggy
older woman

446
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,370
what are you here

447
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,890
one right here

448
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,400
long kind of a crooked nose

449
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,440
persist lips

450
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,090
sharp

451
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,580
chin

452
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,770
her hair

453
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:46,390
this is our cartoon that first appeared
in the british humor magazine punch

454
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:51,660
was discovered by you g boring has a
famous all psychologist now deceased

455
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:58,660
it sometimes known as my wife and my
mother in law

456
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,020
but again

457
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,000
the picture hasn't changed

458
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,179
that stimulation remains constant

459
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:12,400
but the perception can change depending
on how you look at it

460
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,549
you're either seeing are young

461
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:17,919
fairly pretty young woman turned away

462
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,260
from the proceed or

463
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,860
or you see

464
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,669
already somewhat

465
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:23,590
not so pretty

466
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,210
not so young woman

467
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,339
staring down

468
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:29,120
the perceive ur

469
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,020
stimulus remains constant

470
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,600
the perception

471
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,950
changes

472
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:39,120
here's another example of this is a
picture of a doc here is the doc speak

473
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,470
the dockside

474
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,790
the doc snack

475
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:48,790
the back of the docs head

476
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,840
or it's a rabbit with the rabbit ears

477
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,920
the rabbits on

478
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,810
idea lecture you get so much good
feedback right

479
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:04,340
the little rabbit smiles and so on

480
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,530
this picture had originally appeared in
a german humor magazine called there for

481
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,980
the end of the latter

482
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,850
which i think means low-flying blatter
but i'm not sure

483
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,390
in any event the american psychologist
joseph just roll picked this up

484
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,960
and it's now a known as the just roll
rabbit doc figure

485
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,340
stimulus remains constant

486
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,850
but the perception changes

487
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,570
depending on

488
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,760
how you look

489
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,350
these are again

490
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,029
nor does m big u_s_ figures sometimes
reversible figures sometimes are known

491
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:43,030
as by stable figures

492
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,940
and the important thing about them

493
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,460
is that the pattern of proximo
stimulation remains constant

494
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:55,330
the image cast by the object on your
radnor doesn't change at all

495
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,040
but the perception

496
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,120
changes

497
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:03,789
depending on what you focus on and how
you are identified various features on

498
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:08,710
the object where you bring we could go
beyond the information

499
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,549
of the provided by the stimulus

500
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,769
you go beyond that information

501
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:18,130
drawing on your own world knowledge of
expectations your beliefs and so on

502
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,270
you will see

503
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,330
or objects differently

504
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,380
only even though

505
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,690
the wrong

506
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,970
the signals remains the same

507
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,220
this is all going back to rubin's laws
for a second

508
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,270
this was a all vase produced in england
for the silver jubilee the twenty-fifth

509
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:38,230
wedding anniversary of queen elizabeth
the second earner concert prince philip

510
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,940
as a very nice laws

511
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,860
okay

512
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,179
all but when you you the vase who gets
the black background

513
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:45,700
what you see is

514
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,299
phillips

515
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:50,510
profile

516
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,530
and elizabeth ps

517
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,170
profile

518
00:24:54,170 --> 00:25:01,170
so lovely commercial adaptation of the
idea of of the reversible

519
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,200
when i was in college

520
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,320
college students everywhere had these
things on their walls

521
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,009
all of

522
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:11,720
posters by the swiss artist mc asher

523
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,350
and again what at what s your dollars of
his arch makes a lot of use of

524
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,490
reversible figures

525
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,639
you can't perceive this is painting a
day and night

526
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:22,870
you can proceed with that

527
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:23,580
words

528
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,980
flying to the right

529
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,750
or you can perceive it as

530
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,970
words

531
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,090
to the left

532
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,350
not enough information in the object to
tell you what's what

533
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:34,899
okay

534
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:36,540
it's how you look at it

535
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,880
here we have all another escher
paintings circle limit four palm

536
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,160
you can c

537
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,130
white angel's against a black background

538
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,320
or you can see

539
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,190
that's

540
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:52,790
against

541
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,220
a white background

542
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,190
again

543
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,550
all the information

544
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,710
is insufficient to tell you what it is
is that a picture of angels or is it a

545
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,110
picture

546
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,690
that's

547
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:11,230
here is a painting by salvador dali of a
market one north african market

548
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,100
here's a person sitting at a table with
saturn

549
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:20,480
there is some rulings hearing you're
looking out on a deal on radio log

550
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,120
this talk of desert

551
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,360
everybody see that

552
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,020
how about the

553
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,450
figure all of them

554
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:37,220
french philosopher roussel right here

555
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,920
with his brawl

556
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,730
is to always his nose his mouth

557
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,500
his chair and and so on

558
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,840
this painting is called slave i'm sarah
gardner subtle voltaire

559
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,840
slave market with disappearing boss told
boulter is the title of this painting

560
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,059
and again before their vote although
dolly use

561
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,899
school rebirth of all figure

562
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:06,750
all locked in his paintings that
delivers

563
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,289
darcy an exhibit of salvador dali
paintings

564
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:14,700
you'll see him use these by stable
figures are quite dog

565
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,570
okay

566
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:21,420
some again point here is dot the
stimulus is remaining constant buck

567
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,899
perception changes

568
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:25,630
depending on how you think about it

569
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:29,220
so stimulus remains constant the
perception changes

570
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,340
depending upon

571
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,080
what parts of the object you pay
attention to

572
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,900
perceive or is actively constructing the
perception

573
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,230
not mechanically extracting information

574
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,940
the all from the stimulus

575
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,890
in that constant sees

576
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:49,120
we have perception remaining constant

577
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,059
despite change in the stimulus

578
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:58,290
in the reversible figures we have
perception changing despite stability

579
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,749
in the stimulus

580
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:04,119
in either way we had decided ciated if
you will

581
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,780
perception from stimulation

582
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,630
we've shown

583
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,710
that perception

584
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,850
is not all or is not just a matter

585
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,890
of recovering

586
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,150
the information provided by the stimulus

587
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,200
here's another our class of examples

588
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,970
this is what's known as the miller liar
illusion

589
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:29,220
where again if your way over on the side
you may not see this quite so well

590
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,000
almost people c

591
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
horizontal line the top-line as longer

592
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,900
though it's not

593
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,350
okay can see that it's not

594
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:56,350
everybody can see that those two lines
are exactly the same in length

595
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,240
but knowing it doesn't make any
difference right there look at the

596
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,860
miller lawyer louis got snow looks
longer right you know it's not but it

597
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,500
still looks

598
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,470
this is known as the miller lawyer
illusion

599
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,170
on all of the to another example of it

600
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,799
here is all

601
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:18,540
uh... real a real-life example

602
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,400
taken from inside and outside a
commercial office building where you

603
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,440
have

604
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,900
vertical

605
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,730
bar here

606
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,210
the so-called eros

607
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,230
uh... and hear we have

608
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,960
we're looking from the inside

609
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,490
this vertical bar

610
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,990
with the

611
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,360
brothers and at this bar

612
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,010
looks longer than this one even though

613
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,899
you can match them up or if you worked
with a look at it on the uh...

614
00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:52,900
on the course website

615
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,480
you can see right here

616
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,640
is a parallel lines

617
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,330
this line

618
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:04,240
and this line exactly the same exactly
the same length

619
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,770
but still of the look that way

620
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,930
okay doesn't look that way audible

621
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,539
here is another

622
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:12,670
version of this

623
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:17,650
this is known as the ponds old allusion

624
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,880
this line

625
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,010
the topmost line top top line

626
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,060
typically appears to be

627
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,990
longer

628
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:31,760
then at the bottom line

629
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,870
even though

630
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,100
it's not you can see that they're
exactly

631
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,350
the same

632
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,990
but again takeaway

633
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,920
those cues

634
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,580
and

635
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,150
length of this line jumps right back

636
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,190
uh... into

637
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,080
into the picture

638
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,450
what's going on here these are these
allusions

639
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:58,800
or or there are no other example of one
helmholtz called unconscious law

640
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,740
unconscious entrances

641
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:05,330
the upper line remember what's going on
here specially consumes pressure the

642
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,600
puzzle delusion you can think of these
wines

643
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,620
as

644
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,790
perspective lines

645
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,939
converging aligns converging

646
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,800
towards a uh...

647
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,030
towards a better she'd point in the
distance as in the

648
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,440
linear perspective rule

649
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,950
that i talked about all last time

650
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,500
but now if you think about these things
as receiving in on in distance

651
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,740
and you apply the sides distance rule

652
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,340
this subject

653
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,679
cast

654
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:33,760
and image

655
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,269
on the road no that's exactly the same
as this line

656
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:39,630
if you perceive

657
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,990
this line as farther away

658
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,149
because so the distance

659
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:46,980
cues provided by these

660
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,670
converging lines

661
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,480
your perceptual system will conclude
that

662
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,520
this line

663
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,620
must actually be longer

664
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,750
this line should be longer than this one
if this line been farther away is going

665
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:03,590
to test an image of the same size as
this line

666
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,800
what's happening here is

667
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,659
the present as if the perceptual system
go through a kind of silly prism okay

668
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:13,600
yelper wind up here as farther away

669
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,800
but the size of the rebel image of the
upper line is the same as the size of

670
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,380
the image of the lower line

671
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,230
therefore

672
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:26,830
a conclusion an inference therefore it
must be at the upper line is longer

673
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:32,520
than lower line and again these or
unconscious inferences

674
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,680
that create delusion

675
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,650
that one-liners longer than another when
in fact it is not

676
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,950
or part of the perceptual act of going
beyond the information given by the

677
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,760
stimulus

678
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,440
apply in what we know about size and
distance relations

679
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,119
to construct a mental representation are
percept

680
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,130
that is not necessarily the same as

681
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,610
the object we're proceeding

682
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,900
something very similar happens with the
miller wire allusion

683
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,620
you can't think of these

684
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,669
brothers here

685
00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:07,580
as as if they are converging lines

686
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,150
so they provide information about
distance

687
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:11,970
okay

688
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:12,820
so

689
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,249
if this line

690
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:19,690
is perceived as farther away from this
line but the retinal sizes are the same

691
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,830
then you will conclude

692
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,989
that this line

693
00:33:21,989 --> 00:33:23,640
must actually be bigger

694
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,889
than the other one mechanism behind the
miller lighter allusion

695
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:29,649
and the pollen solution

696
00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:31,680
basically the same okay

697
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,520
the bom

698
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,489
perceptual system

699
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:37,470
is taking account of distance cues

700
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,490
to make it inferences about sides

701
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,970
it's not recovering information about
size from the stimulus it's making a

702
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,549
inference about what this law is or

703
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:49,980
flights might be

704
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,100
here's another example he got a really
good view of it last night

705
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,429
on if you were looking the right way to
the beautiful full moon

706
00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:01,919
all outside and all of this is a full
moon rising over the east bay hills

707
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,280
there's alcatraz or island

708
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,870
and what you notice when you look at the
mourners arises over the hills is that

709
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,549
it looks huge

710
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,879
but then you go out later at night

711
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:15,939
and you look at the moon up

712
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:18,929
are in the senate in the middle of the
sky look at the moon and see if it

713
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:21,169
doesn't look so big

714
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:24,889
that's what this is what's known as the
moon illusion

715
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:25,689
okay

716
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,119
the more illusion is

717
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,610
but the more it on the horizon appears
to be a larger

718
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,560
than the moon when viewed

719
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,979
at zenith

720
00:34:34,979 --> 00:34:36,499
it's not

721
00:34:36,499 --> 00:34:37,240
okay

722
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,679
it's just

723
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,230
the moon doesn't change in size

724
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,599
all of those that crosses does it
crosses the skyline

725
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,879
but what happens is

726
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:47,559
the visual system

727
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:50,579
takes into our college

728
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:51,680
distance

729
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,589
information

730
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:54,209
provided by

731
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:56,669
objects on the horizon

732
00:34:56,669 --> 00:35:00,809
to given impression that the mood is
very large when you look at the moon

733
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:04,869
overhead you don't have those distance
accuse any longer so you see the moon

734
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,370
pretty much the size

735
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,699
that it is so again the moon illusion

736
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:11,649
is another example

737
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:14,729
aldape fursat being created

738
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:16,979
bite unconscious inferences

739
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:20,710
by going to be on the information given
by the stimulus okay

740
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:25,489
to make things appear different from the
way they actually are

741
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:27,899
size constant things

742
00:35:27,899 --> 00:35:29,200
reversible figures

743
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,110
now the perceptual delusions

744
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,870
or third-class a perceptual phenomena

745
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:34,880
that suggests

746
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,719
that the ecological view is not quite
right

747
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,909
that we do more than extract information
from the stimulus instead

748
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:45,249
we go beyond that the information given
by the stimulus

749
00:35:45,249 --> 00:35:46,250
to construct

750
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,729
our process

751
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:51,339
here is another example has called the
ames room

752
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:54,999
there used to be one of these at the
exploratorium over in san francisco i

753
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:58,499
think they've temporarily dismantled and
now anybody been the exploratorium

754
00:35:58,499 --> 00:35:59,579
lately

755
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:06,579
is the answer is still there

756
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:10,289
near until either been over there awhile
either it's a bit of next time you go

757
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:14,349
look for this thoroughly about three
ames rooms in existence now

758
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:17,579
or the end of the one of the
exploratorium is one of the better ones

759
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:18,800
here we have

760
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,919
true

761
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:21,359
young girls

762
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,279
or one who looks very tahole

763
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:29,459
and that the other one all look so looks
very short or in fact there identical

764
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:34,899
twins and their as close to the same
insides as to little kids alot and i can

765
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:35,690
get

766
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:39,280
but when you look at the moment when you
look at people in the ames room

767
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,419
what you will see

768
00:36:40,419 --> 00:36:46,339
is something like this or one person is
seems extraordinarily

769
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:50,829
and the other of seems extraordinarily
of the small

770
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:53,349
the way this works like this

771
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:57,610
here is a about the kind of schematic
diagram beings room

772
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,390
when you look into the room

773
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:02,930
you have got some kind of set of
expectations about what rooms are going

774
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,369
to look like rooms are rectangular

775
00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:06,950
okay

776
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,710
they have ninety degree

777
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:13,480
uh... angles of the recorders the floors
of the ceilings people balls that ninety

778
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,869
degree angle

779
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:20,469
the windows in the doors are rectangular
they have ninety degree angle sanam

780
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:22,800
that's what we expect rooms to look like

781
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,329
and when we look at the end room that's
what we expect to see

782
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:32,549
but in fact indians room your viewing he
has room through a little hole in the

783
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:34,199
wall here

784
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:37,499
and it turns out

785
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:41,219
sailing all beings room is angle dot up

786
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:43,580
in a kind of trapezoidal matter

787
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:48,739
so that this corner is way higher that
though uh...

788
00:37:48,739 --> 00:37:51,059
what what what higher with respect to
the floor

789
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:53,570
than this corner is moreover

790
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,500
this wall is angled weight out

791
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,420
with respect to the absorber

792
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,149
so that

793
00:38:00,149 --> 00:38:04,170
point here is much more distant trauma
the viewer

794
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,959
then this point is

795
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:10,700
the our windows are arranged in a
trapezoidal shape so that

796
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,499
things kind of

797
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:16,239
in a particular way and what happens is
you've got

798
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,839
a four-foot tall kid standing here

799
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,880
again stop three forty three and a half
what'll

800
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,619
ceiling

801
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:27,349
and you've got of four-foot tall twin

802
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:28,690
of that child

803
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,729
standing here

804
00:38:29,729 --> 00:38:31,239
against an eight or nine foot

805
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,870
or highlight ceiling

806
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,900
giving the impression

807
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,150
that the one

808
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,490
child is very very very tall

809
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,819
and the other top child

810
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:40,949
it's very very small

811
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:44,069
this illusion would not work

812
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:49,069
if all we did to get our impressions of
size was too one pack the size of the

813
00:38:49,069 --> 00:38:50,859
retinal image

814
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:52,170
what happens here

815
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,769
is that

816
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:57,509
we have expectations about what rooms
are going to look like

817
00:38:57,509 --> 00:39:03,800
we have expectations about hold hold
children are and these expectations

818
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,560
lead our perceptions astray

819
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,459
leaders to perceive things differently

820
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:11,609
the way they actually are

821
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:13,780
so again indians rule

822
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,380
we have all lack of

823
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,759
the usual distance cues

824
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:23,709
there's budget very misleading stimulus
information even a floor here notices

825
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:25,459
checkerboard floor

826
00:39:25,459 --> 00:39:29,299
creates kind of perspective lines in the
way that raphael lsd painting the school

827
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:30,699
of athens did

828
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:33,190
but these aren't in fact square

829
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:39,349
dave there trapezoidal as well in shape
alot to to uh... to create the solution

830
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:41,579
so there's all unconventional geometry

831
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:47,039
we don't expect it so we have we bring
to the perception on inappropriate

832
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,169
expectations about what things are going
to look like

833
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:54,289
so we don't compensate because of the
lack of distance cues because of the

834
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:58,869
unconventional geometry we don't engage
in our usual compensation

835
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,990
for differences and rebel size

836
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,080
and instead

837
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,280
the the world

838
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,439
in this very very strange

839
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:09,029
there's very strange way

840
00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:10,509
so again

841
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:13,320
knowledge expectations and beliefs

842
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,830
are brought to bear are in the act of
perception

843
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,189
this is a contribution

844
00:40:18,189 --> 00:40:23,120
from the inside their head inside the
memory of the perceive ur you will

845
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,190
it's not just a matter of extracting
information

846
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,559
from the stimulus

847
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,899
this aqua holds true four

848
00:40:30,899 --> 00:40:33,049
certain cultural differences

849
00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:34,650
in perception

850
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:40,059
here is a picture of a all-girl of a
digi a logical of formation in new

851
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:42,430
mexico it's actually on the navajo

852
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,419
on reservation

853
00:40:44,419 --> 00:40:47,879
and it is known mostly as ship a rock

854
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:51,530
all because the early called european
settlers

855
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,510
looked at this

856
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:55,540
and it kind of reminded them all-day
clipper ship

857
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,609
with mass and sales and so on

858
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:04,619
but not a hole in the apache who lived
in this area didn't call it ship a rock

859
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:07,309
they don't know anything about clipper
ships

860
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:12,630
they call this waited rock wind rock
because it look to them

861
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,749
as it was kind of like a legals and
hawks wing

862
00:41:16,749 --> 00:41:17,789
european settlers

863
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:21,170
with their knowledge of clipper ships
thinks is looks like a club wrote that

864
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,109
this looks like a clipper ship

865
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:27,519
native americans lacking that knowledge
but had a lots of knowledge of birds and

866
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,240
feathers think that this object looks
like o

867
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,319
looks like a wing

868
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:37,170
cultural differences and knowledge
expectations and beliefs

869
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,470
can create

870
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:41,549
cultural differences in perception

871
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:45,039
here's another example

872
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:47,290
ask you if we ask you what this is

873
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,339
most of you will say it's a whale

874
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,179
yours that's smelled

875
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:53,509
here's its fin

876
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:54,859
here's its body

877
00:41:54,859 --> 00:42:01,859
here's it's tale

878
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:04,799
or you could think of it is a kangaroo

879
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:06,039
here's its

880
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:06,869
snout

881
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:08,339
and it's a year

882
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,180
and it's four leg

883
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,989
body and its little study kangaroo tail

884
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:18,349
this is known as the royal kangaroo
reversible figure

885
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:22,060
now what's the law a lot of you saw the
catcher looks like pointed out

886
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:26,140
but it turns out that if you present
this figure to australian college

887
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,329
students

888
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:30,549
basically kangaroo immediately

889
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,740
here and that an experiment we did

890
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,100
all be presented

891
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,410
the way ok grew and act what's known as
the cut on a core inflation that is the

892
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,209
way you'd expect to see attend guru

893
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:46,070
and demand on conical orientation hardly
ever see we hardly ever see kangaroos

894
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:50,669
like this

895
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:53,710
no matter how do you worry into the
figure everybody

896
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:59,599
north americans and australian soil the
whale and saw the whale immediately

897
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,209
australians

898
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:02,389
were more than twice as likely

899
00:43:02,389 --> 00:43:04,369
to see the arm

900
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:05,999
to see the kangaroo

901
00:43:05,999 --> 00:43:08,460
then north american students work

902
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,320
and that was especially the case

903
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,480
and when the of when the figure was
presented in the non canonical

904
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,220
of version and the reason for that is

905
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,130
that actually australian c_k_ gruza look
like this

906
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,950
they see dead kangaroos

907
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:26,260
they seek a dead kangaroo strong up on
fences they seek a bruise and all sorts

908
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,439
of weird positions goes

909
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,719
that's something they do with kangaroos
there

910
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:34,369
country that kills its national animal

911
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:36,279
alm

912
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:39,820
okay there are pressed for ranchers are
kinda like coyotes in this country

913
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,369
but the point is

914
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:47,079
australians naught off a lot more about
kangaroos the north americans do

915
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:51,599
so they're more prepared to see
kangaroos and ambiguous figures like the

916
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,960
way ok grew

917
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,529
and they're more likely to see this
figure

918
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:59,509
inaugural calling another orientations

919
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:00,820
here's another example

920
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,819
the constellations in these sky

921
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:08,049
the patterns of stars that we've got
that that we look at

922
00:44:08,049 --> 00:44:09,250
are often

923
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,450
or referred to

924
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:16,769
as if they were objects of various kinds
here's our ryan the hunter with his

925
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:17,439
legs

926
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:19,119
his belt

927
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,369
his head

928
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:21,530
is she old

929
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,949
and his club

930
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:25,010
here's torres the bull

931
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,110
with his

932
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,209
head

933
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:27,610
and

934
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:28,939
the tips of his horns

935
00:44:28,939 --> 00:44:30,789
if you think about it for a second

936
00:44:30,789 --> 00:44:34,599
this might look a lot like a hunter but
doesn't look anything like a ball

937
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:37,380
okay

938
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,950
why people did what i want to look
locate stars in the sky was that i'll

939
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:44,869
write will make this one cuts kinda
sorta like a bull will call the taurus

940
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:46,190
the bull right

941
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,249
and people but what makes a likable and
was well what here's the warrens

942
00:44:50,249 --> 00:44:52,780
and here's the space and and and so and
so forth

943
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,239
that kind of built up

944
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:56,709
or perception

945
00:44:56,709 --> 00:44:57,459
makes

946
00:44:57,459 --> 00:45:01,109
a stimulus that doesn't look very much
like a ball

947
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:02,479
into

948
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:08,630
percept that actually dogs in some sense
resemble a bull and again different

949
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,899
cultures

950
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:12,849
deal with the constellations in
different ways

951
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:14,209
here is the

952
00:45:14,209 --> 00:45:17,530
all these on star pattern the
constellation

953
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:22,619
that most of us know s or some major the
great bearer okay

954
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,129
the body of the bearer

955
00:45:25,129 --> 00:45:26,280
and the bears

956
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,339
tale

957
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:32,059
some head their does look a whole lot
like a bear but that's what we call it

958
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:32,739
we call it

959
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:34,319
the great there

960
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,569
in

961
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:37,230
nora and in france

962
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,499
that same pattern of scrawled stars

963
00:45:39,499 --> 00:45:41,969
is called let castro rule

964
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:43,909
okay

965
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,370
or the big dipper

966
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:49,209
here is the pot and here's its handle

967
00:45:49,209 --> 00:45:52,060
in medieval europe a specially in

968
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,990
stars in the a medieval spain

969
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,880
the same pattern of stars

970
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,739
was looked at what was the with
identified as charles why did

971
00:45:59,739 --> 00:46:01,249
here is the wagon

972
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:03,420
with the axles of the wheels

973
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,290
and here is the yoke attached

974
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:06,599
to horace

975
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,559
in england the same a pattern of stars

976
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:11,310
is called aplomb

977
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:15,680
you go to that bar in berkeley the story
plot we'll see this pattern of stars

978
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,900
right

979
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,349
and it's not cold

980
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:19,369
or some major

981
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:21,379
it's called the plot no

982
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:22,469
all

983
00:46:22,469 --> 00:46:27,059
some greeks and saw or heard as well as
native americans refer to this is the

984
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:27,790
great bear

985
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:29,479
but look at how different

986
00:46:29,479 --> 00:46:33,799
the greek constellation is from the one
that's familiar to us now

987
00:46:33,799 --> 00:46:36,499
here the beer ranges much

988
00:46:36,499 --> 00:46:38,059
more

989
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:38,510
widely

990
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:41,029
than the pattern of stores itself

991
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:42,599
in china

992
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,719
the same pattern of stars

993
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:49,369
was perceived as celestial bureaucrats

994
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:51,090
you've got of bureaucrat

995
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,549
on a podium

996
00:46:52,549 --> 00:46:57,439
and soem supplicants coming here to want
to talk and doesn't look anything like

997
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,180
that

998
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:02,809
but that's how the object was perceived
by the ancient chinese

999
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:04,969
that was the perception that they used

1000
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:07,510
to guide their orientation in the sky

1001
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,940
and then finally

1002
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,749
into ancient egypt

1003
00:47:10,749 --> 00:47:13,949
precisely the same pattern stores was
recognized

1004
00:47:13,949 --> 00:47:16,189
and all it was perceived as

1005
00:47:16,189 --> 00:47:17,449
home

1006
00:47:17,449 --> 00:47:18,819
a_d_r_

1007
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:20,310
part of a bull

1008
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:21,410
and a

1009
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,300
aboard mir

1010
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,439
and amanda

1011
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:26,789
and uh... we're in kind of hippopotamus

1012
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:28,270
doesn't look anything like that

1013
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:31,420
but that's how the ancient egyptians

1014
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,170
constructed eight percent

1015
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:36,169
from ambiguous stimulation in

1016
00:47:36,169 --> 00:47:38,659
the environment

1017
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:40,279
night sky

1018
00:47:40,279 --> 00:47:47,279
one more demonstrations as what's this

1019
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:53,709
it's a dalmatian dog ok here is the
dalmatian here's is four legs here's his

1020
00:47:53,709 --> 00:47:55,459
hind legs

1021
00:47:55,459 --> 00:48:00,109
drinking out of a puddle or something

1022
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:06,089
what's this

1023
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:08,589
train locomotive

1024
00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:10,839
steve all right

1025
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:17,839
steam engine wheels here

1026
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:22,959
what's best

1027
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:29,249
what could this possibly

1028
00:48:29,249 --> 00:48:33,199
what came over for donot see these
parallel lines here and there is a

1029
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:35,609
surface is going out to the back

1030
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:36,770
see what you're doing is

1031
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:41,480
you're trying to figure out walk could
this possibly be what do i know when the

1032
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,320
world that looks like this

1033
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,429
the stimulation itself is very ambiguous

1034
00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:48,689
but when you start thinking about it for
a while

1035
00:48:48,689 --> 00:48:52,769
you begin to perceive what the object is

1036
00:48:52,769 --> 00:48:55,470
perception that is intelligent activity

1037
00:48:55,470 --> 00:49:00,579
it's not just a matter of mechanically
extracting information from the stimulus

1038
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:02,369
out in the environment

1039
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:08,669
rather the perceive our has to actively
engage in problem solving activity

1040
00:49:08,669 --> 00:49:14,359
bringing his or her knowledge
expectations and beliefs to bear on the

1041
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:15,239
problem of

1042
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:16,769
figuring out

1043
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:19,629
what the objects on the world are

1044
00:49:19,629 --> 00:49:22,619
where they are what they're doing

1045
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:24,609
what we can do with them

1046
00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:27,340
that's the intelligence of perception

1047
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,270
and that is the general thrust

1048
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,349
on the constructivist view

1049
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:33,439
thank you very much

1050
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,379
you will be meeting with a genocides on
monday
