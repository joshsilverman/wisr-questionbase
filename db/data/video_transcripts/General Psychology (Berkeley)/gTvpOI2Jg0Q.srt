1
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:10,879
okay on

2
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:13,730
in the last several lecturers

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,119
we've been looking at fundamental
psychological processes involved in

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,510
learning

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,789
perceiving and remembering

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:26,140
and one of the things that we have
uncovered in these

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,899
discussions

8
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,210
is that

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,690
learning proceeding and remembering
require more

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,370
than merely forming associations between
stimuli and responses

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,030
more than the extracting information

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,350
from armed

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,470
of the stimulus objects

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,429
more than retrieving memory traces

15
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:46,130
encoded

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,960
are in the past

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,900
rather

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,189
and each of these prophecies

19
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:55,700
the person is actively trying to figure
out what's going on

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,889
in learning

21
00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:01,479
the organism is trying to predict in
control environmental events to learn

22
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,969
what follows what

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,000
and what's gonna happen next

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,270
in perception

25
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,050
the perceive urs apt

26
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,240
trying to figure out what objects are in
the environment

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,820
where they are and what they're doing

28
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,659
in memory the remember is actively
trying to figure out what

29
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,750
and in the past so he or she can use
that information

30
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,360
on you know in in the future

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,670
the point of this

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,000
is that yet is fundamental

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,619
cognitive processes these basic
functions of learning and perceiving and

34
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,299
remembering

35
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,439
dependent to medley

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,700
on the so called a higher mental
processes

37
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,909
involving the reasoning

38
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,130
judgment

39
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,780
inference and a problem solving

40
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,590
and what we want to do not go in that
this next series of lectures

41
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,409
is to focus on these aspects of thinking

42
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:55,070
to try to think about

43
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,130
hobby rezant about objects and events

44
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,820
in order to make a judgment

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,250
and decisions

46
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,990
concerning them

47
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,520
gary hankins then philosophy end in
psychology

48
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,540
of very popular model for this judgment
and reasoning process

49
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,439
that's known as the normative model all
of a judgment and reasoning

50
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,959
and what does normative model basically
says is that when people engage in

51
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,180
problem solving when people reason about
events

52
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,419
they follow the principles of logical
inference

53
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:34,519
principles of logical inference that
have been with us since roughly the time

54
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:37,029
of aristotle

55
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:38,029
furthermore

56
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:40,610
this enormous model argues

57
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,970
rather of sorts

58
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,250
that judgments and decisions and choices

59
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,520
are based on a principle of rational
self interest which is to say

60
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,150
that we make the choices we make because
we think that they're going to benefit

61
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,359
as in some way

62
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:57,590
this principle

63
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,660
of rational self-interest is intern

64
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,079
based on a principal of

65
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:05,230
optimality

66
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,160
which means that in making choices

67
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,009
making judgments

68
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,719
we want to maximize our gains

69
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:16,620
and minimize our losses that's the
principle of optimality

70
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,180
maximize games andrew and minimize
losses

71
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,819
but our judgments are also based on a
principle of utility

72
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:27,900
which is to say that we want to achieve
our goals

73
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,609
in the most you fish and matter possible

74
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:34,709
but i want to take forever to figure out
the all-new

75
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,579
the uh... oh god answered assault

76
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:40,450
we want to get to the correct to the
correct judgment

77
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,969
are just as easily as we can

78
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:46,250
this enormous model of judgment and
reasoning

79
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,869
isn shrine to in economics for those of
you of how to economics course

80
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:54,579
a set of principles known as rational
choice

81
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:58,449
and all uh... according to traditional
economic theory

82
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,970
alm assumes the existence of a kind of
creature

83
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,569
or they call it homo economic times

84
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:06,440
or economic man

85
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,259
all who basically

86
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,229
behaves

87
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:10,959
chooses reasons

88
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,360
makes judgments

89
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,199
based on

90
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,440
this idealize description

91
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,049
of how judgments and reza means are made

92
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,839
one

93
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,520
cleaner expression of this normative
model of judgment and reasoning is an

94
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,169
emphasis on the use of algorithms

95
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,140
in reasoning band

96
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,159
our judgment

97
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,219
and problem solving

98
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:39,369
we define algorithms as logical

99
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:40,849
systematic rules

100
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,150
for making trip

101
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,490
this and inferences

102
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,870
and the idea behind it

103
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,520
algorithms

104
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,610
is that

105
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,509
if you're confronted with a problem
that's soluble

106
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:55,270
problem that can be solved

107
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,960
application all of the appropriate
algorithm will inevitably lead too

108
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,610
the correct

109
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,289
okay if a problem a salary will
application of the appropriate algorithm

110
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:10,499
will inevitably lead to the correct
answer

111
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:17,009
therefore it follows that if people were
rational in their judgment all of the

112
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:21,740
judgments and decision making if they
were rational and their choices and the

113
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,680
way they went about solving problems
then they would always employ algorithms

114
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,080
whenever they were confronted

115
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,880
with any kind of problem

116
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,179
the emphasis on algorithms is part of
the parcel off

117
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:37,950
all rational on choice view

118
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,840
all-volunteer in judgment and decision
making

119
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,719
let's take a detailed below those

120
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:45,380
all about estimation

121
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,580
suppose you want to are

122
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,499
estimate how many people there are
living in united states

123
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:53,189
farm

124
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:57,639
bellcore's who could compromise suppose
and we do every ten years in this

125
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,199
instance

126
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,999
but that's a lot of work

127
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:00,759
okay

128
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,150
so what you really want to do with the
problem is

129
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,620
to come up with a reasonable estimate

130
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,960
of the number of people who are living
in united states

131
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,490
arm this is a problem dot or his
currently confronted by the federal

132
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,539
government for that matter state
governments

133
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:20,800
in the problem of the argument in the
problem of the census

134
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,120
united states constitution

135
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,879
mandates that ever intended

136
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,410
there be a cult

137
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,020
all of the number of people living in
the united states so as to correctly

138
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,180
apportion fitness like congressional or
rub representatives

139
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,489
but for a brother things as well

140
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:41,620
it's turning out to be too difficult to
do any headcount

141
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,550
of people

142
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,069
there's simply too many people united
states

143
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,979
living under too many different kinds of
conditions in too many places

144
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,959
alerted to even uh... that expect that
there be a reasonably accurate head

145
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,979
count

146
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,870
saw there from time to time

147
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,840
there are proposals

148
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,599
too

149
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,579
all-out use statistical criteria or
statistical process ease

150
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:07,429
to get our best estimate of what

151
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,010
this head counters

152
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,529
and in fact we know how to do that

153
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,430
there is an algorithm

154
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,360
statistical algorithms around for
estimation

155
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,109
and basically they say

156
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:23,689
first what you want to do is to draw a
representative sample of the population

157
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:25,750
or perhaps a random sample

158
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,220
or perhaps what's known as a stratified
sample so you didn't make sure you have

159
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,409
equal numbers of men and women in your
sample or

160
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:34,539
something like that

161
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:40,419
and then what you do is you count that
representative sample of the population

162
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:46,080
and then you extrapolate from the sample
too with a population at large in again

163
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,129
there are rules in statistics

164
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:50,570
for figuring out

165
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,740
her buchanan forever

166
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,409
population values from the values of
samples

167
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,239
following these kinds of rules

168
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:59,289
it's known

169
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:04,030
that we're very unlikely to make a
mistake estimating the population of the

170
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,349
united states statistically

171
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:09,239
armed doesn't under count the poor

172
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,399
it doesn't under count

173
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,029
minorities as far as

174
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:15,879
whereas because

175
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:16,699
people

176
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:21,249
and members of ethnic minority groups
often live

177
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:23,909
outside the mainstream all fall

178
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,350
dot of society

179
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,430
it's very difficult to get of proper
account of these individuals with an

180
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,210
actual headcount course a legal problem
is that the constitution mandates a head

181
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,460
count

182
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,880
as you've got account these people you
can't estimate them so there's a

183
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,890
difficult legal question here but the
point is we know how to do this

184
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,910
statisticians of known for a hundred
years

185
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,190
how did produce

186
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,870
very very good estimates of large
numbers

187
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,730
like the population all the united
states

188
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:00,570
and they don't by applying various kinds
of algorithms

189
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,670
approach to

190
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,340
the use of algorithms in

191
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,660
problem solving in making judgments

192
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,790
is itself

193
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,110
an example of a lot

194
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,880
attitude for problem solving

195
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,990
known as means and analysis

196
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,160
in the means and analysis all problem
solving

197
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,000
we take we've we began first

198
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,100
the elements

199
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,400
the features that are common to all
problems

200
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,560
all problems have a set of germans

201
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,200
assumptions

202
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,529
that you can make

203
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:35,520
about the state of the world

204
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,180
second

205
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,940
all problems have

206
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,710
specified in them some goal that want to
achieve

207
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,630
third

208
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,920
there are transformations that have to
take place

209
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,129
to get from

210
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:56,269
the original state of the problem to the
bell st of the problem and then finally

211
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:58,609
there are some obstacles

212
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:01,220
on the way to the colstate

213
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,010
these obstacles are kind of defining
features of problems you don't have a

214
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,200
problem and then some there's some

215
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,260
saluted some obstacle or two with so to
a solution

216
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,899
but the general idea

217
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,229
is that when you've got any problem to
solve

218
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:20,939
what you do is the first thing to do is
you forearm on mental representation of

219
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:23,870
your current state

220
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,380
then you form a mental representation of
your goal state

221
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,210
you calculate the difference between
your current state and your goal state

222
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:39,240
and then you take some steps that will
reduce that difference by some amount

223
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,360
and then what you do

224
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,010
is you recalculate

225
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,089
we represent

226
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,960
the goal state and your current state

227
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,099
recalculate the difference and then take
another step

228
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:49,960
that will reduce that still further

229
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,070
i walked over here from my office and
pullman hall this morning

230
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,260
and when i thought about it i thought
about that but it was raining action

231
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,880
without

232
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,940
how my going to get to pullman hall

233
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,000
on with the uh... with them with the
yield minimum likelihood that i'm gonna

234
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,959
get wet

235
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,069
so i try to calculate a shortcut

236
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:10,999
and so what i did was alright instead of
going down the steps nearest may all go

237
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:14,650
down some steps or the over here that'll
let me

238
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,610
walker undercover for a little bit
longer

239
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,580
i represented my current state

240
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,999
i represented the goals date

241
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:24,870
calculated the difference between them
and then took some steps

242
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,390
reduce that difference

243
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,050
all

244
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,140
applications of means and the problem
solving

245
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,510
involved this kind of process

246
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,730
it's something it's a process that

247
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,499
it's been studied into a problem very
fickle your problem in the psychological

248
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,480
literature

249
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,590
known as a tower of hanoi problem

250
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,380
which basically says unhone away there's
a temple

251
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,220
in with there's a tolerance thx t four
sacred goldman discs each trimmed with

252
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,070
diamonds

253
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,470
and these discs are stacked on top of
each other in such a way that the

254
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,960
largest

255
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,220
and the smallest is on the top

256
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,649
and a problem for the monks in the
temple

257
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:07,530
is to move the disks from one location
to another in such a way

258
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,210
that a larger discussed replaced on

259
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,960
top of a smaller desk

260
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,500
and that's fine you can figure out how
to do that radius

261
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,600
onto disks and

262
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,350
put them over there

263
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,460
but no there's an obstacle the first
obstacle is that you have to move the

264
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,380
discs one-at-a-time

265
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,709
the second obstacle is you'd have to dot
do it in such a way

266
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:32,810
that their arden never larger disk on
top of a smaller desk

267
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,279
and the third obstacle is

268
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,040
either as sacred desks

269
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,550
and there's only one other place in the
temple where they can be hollows okay so

270
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,560
how are you going to do the problem

271
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,649
here orthodox how we're going to do it

272
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:46,150
how long's are going to take

273
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,990
the legend is that before the monks
complete the task the world will end

274
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,410
i think that's the legend of the tower
of happily

275
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,790
here's a simple representation of it

276
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,800
we've got

277
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,660
a tolerant discs

278
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,440
small on top of larger on top of the
largest

279
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,820
we want to get them from this location

280
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,130
the dislocation and there's only one
other location where the discs

281
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:16,130
can be stored so how do we do this who
wants to do the powerful wipro

282
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,230
i see something you do it

283
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,710
flustered wonder

284
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,800
you know i don't

285
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,990
okay let's do it

286
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:29,990
how to solve this problem

287
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:42,050
for one of the melbourne

288
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,700
their eg that's exactly right that's
exactly how you get it

289
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,250
and notice how to get our life for you
and your couple of other people didn't

290
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,110
and doing this right yeah i calculate my
cardiac calculate what you want to go

291
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,360
against step-by-step reduce the
difference between where you are and

292
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,569
where you want to go

293
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:07,769
that's the means and algorithm for
problem solving and that there's a

294
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:13,129
problem that soluble the means and
analysis and guaranteed to produce dot

295
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:16,440
correct answer now of course i can take
a long time

296
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,300
it turns out r_k_ that by doing this at
all of this way if you were actually

297
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,320
sitting in the tower of hanoi

298
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,560
are moving sixty four just in this way
all at the rate of one per second would

299
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,330
take five billion years

300
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,720
that's it

301
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,250
pretty much the age of the earth

302
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,499
all right so

303
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:38,210
well it's a pretty good guess that the
monks are not going to finish this task

304
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,880
before your calms ought to an end

305
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,600
for your is absent exercise this week

306
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,970
you're going to do a version of this
problem on known as the harvard supports

307
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,620
problem actually zaps calls at the
missionaries in cannibals problem

308
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,950
but it has the same kind of all

309
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,449
although property to it

310
00:14:56,449 --> 00:15:00,220
on one side of the river there's free
hobbits and three works

311
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,510
orcs eve hobbits when they are a number
of them

312
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,780
the creatures have a boat that's cable
taking too

313
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,110
individuals at a time across the river

314
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,450
and the goal is to transport all six
creatures from one side of the river

315
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,829
ought to the other with the proviso that
at no time

316
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:20,359
in either location

317
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:23,550
can works out number hoffitz

318
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,300
now that's formally

319
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,800
pretty much the same as the power of
hanoi problem

320
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,060
and you solve it

321
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,970
using the of means and problem solving
analysis though some of those of you

322
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,089
who've already done that's number for
you know that there is

323
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:39,139
a kind of subtle obstacle

324
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,510
or here

325
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,810
and all the that to you

326
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,229
to figure out

327
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:46,600
exactly songs exactly what that is

328
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,740
again

329
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,119
means the end

330
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:51,230
approaches to problem solving

331
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,770
exemplified this algorithmic reasoning

332
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:59,760
the algorithm constitutes essentially a
recipe for solving a problem that

333
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,280
specifies all all the necessary
ingredients

334
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,020
and their amounts

335
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,690
and of the order in which they're going
to combine are and if you follow a

336
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,160
recipe if you've got all the ingredients
new fall the recipe carefully you're

337
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,820
gonna get i'd take

338
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,140
fried tofu or whatever it is that you're
eating right cooked properly

339
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,580
and something that's in of that so addl

340
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,000
all you have to do

341
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,080
is follow

342
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,030
the steps

343
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,320
this same kind of approach

344
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,020
tendon principal be used

345
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,480
to solve a fundamental cognitive problem

346
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,270
which is approx on the of categorization

347
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:43,949
categorization is an extremely important
aspect of all of cognition

348
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:47,779
where we sort the objects of the world
into categories

349
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:48,980
are based on

350
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,569
some kind of similarity

351
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:52,490
so all cars

352
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,210
you know buicks and

353
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,890
dodges end

354
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,599
homers and twenty orders

355
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,919
they all belong in the category of
automobiles because they have certain

356
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,410
features in common

357
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,209
although do you think about perception
cognitively

358
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:11,649
the endpoint of perception is not simply
to identify the distal stimulus the

359
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:15,090
treaty or the gorilla or the dinosaur or
whatever

360
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,210
but you also wants the categorized an
object

361
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,250
so that you know what to do with it
because they are yes i know what this is

362
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,230
it's like these other things or you
already know what to do along with

363
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,959
the great cognitive psychologist jerome
bruder

364
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,500
went so far as to argue that every act
perception

365
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,710
is an active categorization

366
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,100
because when you perceived an object

367
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,760
you perceive that as similar to

368
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,610
somethings you already know about

369
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,119
and different from

370
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,500
other things that you already know about

371
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,630
and the question is

372
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,590
how do we go about categorizing the
objects in our world

373
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,960
again there's a classical view of this
process accomplice

374
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,660
from aristotle

375
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,910
and basically says

376
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,559
don't too bold

377
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,559
logical way to think about categories

378
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,460
is in terms of property sets you
probably remember the term proper sets

379
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,480
from

380
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,000
eighth grade

381
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,990
mathematics maybe ninth-grade
mathematics

382
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,879
all in dog did in that the in separate
or proper set

383
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,340
is a set of objects

384
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,450
that have a set of defining features in
common

385
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,830
and a defining feature these defining
features are signalling necessary

386
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,610
to identify an object is a member of a
set

387
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,019
and

388
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:38,730
the package of features is jointly
sufficient to identify an object as

389
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,820
remember of the part of the set

390
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,280
give you some examples

391
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,330
so in cat in geometry

392
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,410
for example

393
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,669
we have a set of

394
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:50,010
are geometrical figure is known as
triangles

395
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,640
which are defined as two-dimensional
figures

396
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,330
with three sides and three angles

397
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,909
all triangles

398
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,930
or two-dimensional figures with three
sides and three angles

399
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,019
that div those features

400
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,930
define the category of triangles in
geometry

401
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,470
all up and that's different

402
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,919
from the definition in geometry o

403
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,070
quadrilateral sp

404
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,309
which are features into dimensions

405
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:16,980
that have four sides

406
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,760
and four angles

407
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,490
all quadrilateral our share

408
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,210
these three defining features on in
common two dimensions

409
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,080
four sides and for angles

410
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,849
similarly

411
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:32,420
in the domain of animals

412
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,090
we distinguish between categories of
birds

413
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,920
robbins sparrows eagles hawks

414
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,910
trout

415
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,169
bass

416
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:44,210
salmon grouper

417
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,720
earth will it ever

418
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,659
all all birds arbroath births with were
warm-blooded

419
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:51,269
and have further someone's

420
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:55,210
all birds or warm-blooded vertebrates
with feathers and wings

421
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,440
bos four features

422
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,380
or a single enough history

423
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,980
and jointly sufficient to define the
category of bird

424
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,619
whereas all fish

425
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,820
or cold-blooded vertebrates

426
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,880
with scales and fins

427
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,499
those four features

428
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,330
or a single investors there re

429
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,289
and jointly sufficient to define the
category of fish

430
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:18,210
every creature that's abort abort

431
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:18,679
cold-blooded

432
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:22,080
with scales and fins is a fish

433
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,969
just the way fisher defined

434
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,349
all by home

435
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,220
by zoologists

436
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,450
and sold that's generally that that's
the idea about defining features

437
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,490
now

438
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,510
another aspect all categorization bright
by proper sets

439
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,230
is that

440
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,630
you can

441
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,960
arrange categories vertically

442
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,549
into hierarchies

443
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,180
of super it sets

444
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,800
and subsets

445
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,260
and the general idea

446
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,929
is that in the proper said
categorization

447
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:53,179
subsets are perfectly nested

448
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:56,900
under super sets let me give you an
example of that

449
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,260
again we'll go back to geometric figures

450
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,850
there are

451
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,720
here's the whole

452
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,770
class of geometric figures out of up
here

453
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,200
and it turns out that there are

454
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,430
floor

455
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,920
types bob geometric figures

456
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,780
points

457
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:19,770
lines planes and solids what's the
definition of a point

458
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:23,230
religion electorate

459
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,590
okay

460
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,840
is a geological figuring no dimensions

461
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,230
k points don't have any dimensions right
what's the line

462
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,400
one dimension if you don't want to
mention your align

463
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,299
planes to dimensions solids three
dimensions

464
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,060
here we have geometric figures

465
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,970
arranged a december sets

466
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,950
according to the number of dimensions

467
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,360
and then we have

468
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,290
types of planes like triangles and
quadrilateral

469
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,500
all triangles

470
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,560
are two-dimensional figures all
quadrilateral czar two-dimensional

471
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,270
figures but what we've done is we've
added by defining feature

472
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,780
triangles our planes

473
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,500
with three fives

474
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,299
quadrilateral zz our planes

475
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,870
with forrest sawyer

476
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,820
and then we have subsets of triangles
okay

477
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,980
what some people lateral triangle

478
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,030
what's the definition

479
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,520
all sides article altered equal at all
triangles equal five equal angles i saw

480
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,410
sleaze triangles

481
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,970
two sides are equal

482
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,380
scaling triangles

483
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,460
no sides

484
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,680
are equal same thing with quadrilateral
created subsets based on

485
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,690
dark features had to do with your
quality of sides and angles

486
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:42,899
but notice that there is a perfect
nesting here

487
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:47,090
all equal lateral triangles are
triangles

488
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,970
all triangles our planes at all planes
are geometric figures

489
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:57,580
it's not the case of equal lateral
triangles are kinda quadrilateral

490
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,950
or that trapezoidal or a kind of solid
while there are tropical alaska let's

491
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,809
not get into

492
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:06,900
uh... was like a tinder that the point
here is

493
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,889
in

494
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:12,140
classification according to proper sets

495
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,630
sets can be

496
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,570
arrange the hierarchy of subsets and
super sets

497
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:21,690
by simply adding or subtracting defining
features we ad

498
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,880
defining features

499
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,330
triangles and quadrilateral

500
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,990
we add defining features

501
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,630
to get people lateral

502
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,800
and i sasa lease triangles

503
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,870
and so on

504
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,130
another feature of categories as proper
sets

505
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,700
has to do with the horizontal relations

506
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,200
between categories and it follows

507
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,150
from the motion of the proper sad

508
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,539
he said membership hasn't all along or
non quality to it

509
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,350
you're either indosat

510
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,360
or you're not in the set

511
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,039
if you're a geometric will figure you're
either a triangle

512
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,779
or a quadrilateral or something else

513
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:04,899
there are no geometrical figures that
are kind of

514
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:08,769
kind of triangles and kinda
quadrilateral as you've either scot-free

515
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:10,020
slides and three angles

516
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,660
or you don't have three sides in three
angles

517
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,950
you're either in the set or not

518
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,090
put another way

519
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,070
there are very sharp

520
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,859
boundaries

521
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:20,799
between adjacent categories

522
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:27,799
there's a sharp boundary between being a
triangle indiana quadrilateral yes

523
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,070
all okay

524
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,020
let's go back to our perfectly dusted
nesting here okay

525
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,750
squares are kinds of rectangles

526
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,350
so there's actually a subset here
depending on how all rectangles

527
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,420
have four equal angles

528
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,590
okay

529
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,740
the difference between a square in the
not us wareham in that category is what

530
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,770
you've got people sides

531
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,790
so all squares are rectangles

532
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,799
technically all rectangles are parallel
grams but here

533
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,670
i'm talking about there being just two
parallels uh... unparalleled sides aka

534
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,940
rectangles

535
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,900
here we have all the subsides parallel
here we've added another feature

536
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,139
albrecht of the simplified diagram do
you get the idea

537
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,850
the bite amin features

538
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,180
you create subsets

539
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,230
good question

540
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,700
let's go back here for a second again

541
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,570
if you're a geometrical figure your
peter all liner a plane or us or a solid

542
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,850
or something else

543
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:34,410
because you get a gun general dimensions
one dimension to or three p

544
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,659
if you're a plane

545
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:40,200
you're either a triangle or
quadrilateral there's no in between

546
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,559
if you're a triangle

547
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,710
you're either an equal lateral triangle
or and i saw sleaze triangle or scaling

548
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,399
tribal

549
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:49,060
again there's no in between

550
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,230
and terms of

551
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,590
horizontal relations among adjacent
categories

552
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,090
there's a sharp

553
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:56,810
division

554
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,320
between adjacent categories your reader
and one category

555
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,200
or your

556
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,899
another feature of categories as proper
sets

557
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:12,740
is that they have what we call
homogeneous internal structure

558
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,230
by which we mean

559
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,190
all instances alta category

560
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,410
or equally good instances of a category

561
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,880
unequal lateral triangle

562
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,150
is a perfectly good triangle

563
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,750
because it's got three sides in three
angles through dimensions

564
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,530
and then i saw sleaze triangle

565
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,860
is a perfectly good triangle because
it's got

566
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,729
three sides and three angles in two
dimensions

567
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:42,200
it's not that unequal lateral triangle
is in some sense of better triangle

568
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,850
okay

569
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:47,600
they're different but they are all have
the same defining features

570
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,580
because all members all of a proper set

571
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,990
share the same defining features in
common

572
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,870
week improper set theory

573
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,910
we consider all instances of a category

574
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,109
to be equally representative of that
category six all sugar

575
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:06,070
the same set

576
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,730
defining

577
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,500
features

578
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,250
so again

579
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,080
from the proper said view of
categorization

580
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,180
all logical view account of a recession
that goes back at least for the time of

581
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,960
aristotle

582
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,630
we can generate and algorithm

583
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:24,380
for determining category membership of
an object

584
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,610
if you want to define a category

585
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,919
all you have to do

586
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,130
is to determine

587
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:33,160
what the defining features are of deck

588
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,310
all you have to do is to determine

589
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,640
what features

590
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,630
all category members share in common

591
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,010
what features are singly necessary

592
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,339
and jointly sufficient

593
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:45,970
to define that category

594
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:46,990
more important

595
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,760
if you want to characterize an object

596
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,270
the proper said view of categorization

597
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,720
gives you an algorithm for doing that as
well

598
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,300
if i hold something awful and say

599
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,850
is this an envelope

600
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,980
then what you do is

601
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,750
first you analyze the features of the
object to use your perceptual apparatus

602
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,029
to figure out what the features or the
object

603
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:13,500
then

604
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,350
you retrieved from memory

605
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:21,270
your knowledge of the defining features
of that category and then you simply

606
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:26,820
match the features of the object the
perceived features of the object

607
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,700
defining features of the category
represented in memory and if there's a

608
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,870
match usse yes this is a member

609
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,800
okay

610
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,880
so if i show you an object i say is this
an automobile

611
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,500
you look for things like four wheels and
internal combustion engine and this and

612
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,270
that you say audience it has all the
features or mobile so i'm going to call

613
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,909
it an automobile

614
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:51,160
this isn't algorithm

615
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,710
the pro if the problem of categorization
of soluble if there's an answer to the

616
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,269
question

617
00:28:56,269 --> 00:29:02,879
is x a member of category wayy applying
this kind of algorithm where you simply

618
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:04,279
match the features up

619
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,779
all in terms of diff

620
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,500
in features

621
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,770
tell you

622
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,630
an object is a member of

623
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,820
the category or

624
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,809
are again

625
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:17,260
if you're

626
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,990
want to know whether or not ject is a
triangle

627
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,179
see if it's a plane

628
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,940
see that's got three sides see the sky
three angles of a dozen triangle that's

629
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,860
the end of it

630
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,080
and you will

631
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,980
so again

632
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,400
from this point of view

633
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,970
categorization is fundamental cognitive
problem

634
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,859
is something

635
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,409
that can be solved by the application

636
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:41,690
of a

637
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,390
single

638
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,060
are simple algorithm

639
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,529
and of course if that were true i
wouldn't have spent so much time

640
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:48,690
described in this

641
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,320
turns out

642
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,500
but there are some

643
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,200
serious problems

644
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,630
the classical view

645
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,790
of categories as proper sets

646
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,210
in the first place

647
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,900
there are some

648
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,940
categories

649
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,779
that have what part did better known as

650
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:06,390
disjunctive categories

651
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,120
peter because

652
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,600
objects in the categories

653
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,490
do not necessarily share features in
common

654
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,669
there's one very familiar example

655
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:17,049
and that's the strike

656
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,290
in baseball who's a baseball fan here

657
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:27,290
how do you define a strike in baseball

658
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:37,730
no but we're talking about the within
the game

659
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:42,870
pitch has to cross the plate

660
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:46,480
and it also has to be at a particular
hike that has to be roughly from the

661
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,460
needs of the batter to roughly though
armpits

662
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,200
all that ur okay

663
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,169
that's one definition of a strike what's
another definition the strike

664
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:55,409
in baseball

665
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:57,850
dot the only definition yes

666
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,730
a fireball okay

667
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,269
fobel's also a strike

668
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:02,900
what's another

669
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,460
definition of a strike

670
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,720
are swimming in a message does it matter
whether a crosses the plate if you swing

671
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,570
and miss

672
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,260
that's also a strike

673
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,110
i don't know what that is

674
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,360
what else are what else gets called a
strike

675
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,740
in baseball

676
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,970
it's a strike if the umpires says it's a
strike

677
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:30,389
project

678
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,890
so now we got for different things

679
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,450
they are all strikes in baseball than or
equal under the category of strike they

680
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,640
have no features in common

681
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,720
okay no features in common

682
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,320
so this is an example of a disjunctive
category

683
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,269
another example somewhat less familiar
to many people

684
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:52,440
is the category of jazz often call form
of music

685
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:59,440
what's the definition of jazz

686
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:11,020
yeah but what is jet what what what kind
of music and jazz music

687
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:25,490
lots of that's a theory about what jazz
means in creole that's right on to have

688
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,090
sex on we're not going to her okay

689
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,919
bargain jazz turns out to be very
difficult to define

690
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,440
we think about jazz is a form of music
that's based on improvisation

691
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,770
but church organist improvise when they
play bach so that's not

692
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,510
singly necessary

693
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:47,370
also we think about jazz has been based
in a musical form known as blues twelve

694
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:50,550
bar blues were calling response although
format

695
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,240
but there it for some forms of jazz like
swing

696
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,240
that are bluesy role

697
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,159
also there and get them we have a
disjunctive category here

698
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:00,330
there are

699
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,659
piece of the music that are classified
as jazz

700
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:05,050
that don't have any features in common

701
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,110
the fact

702
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,540
have a category like the strike in
baseball

703
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,450
but it's not

704
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,470
characterized in terms of singly
necessary in jointly support and

705
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,529
defining features

706
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,570
is a problem

707
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,289
with the classical view of categories as
proper sense

708
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:23,750
here's another problem

709
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,470
there are many

710
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,180
objects

711
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,280
where whose category membership is on
clear

712
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:37,280
for example if i ask you is or rocket an
article of furniture

713
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,940
who says rug is an article of furniture

714
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,200
who says it isn't

715
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,670
see there you go

716
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,310
you know what what is

717
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,980
everybody or not everybody can override
his

718
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,900
everybody here know what article for
nurturers

719
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,180
how com you can tell me

720
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,980
how come there's disagreement about
whether a broad is an article of

721
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,510
furniture

722
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:07,510
similarly is a pickle a vegetable

723
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:13,200
well yeah i think pickles a vegetable
but you don't really like serena pickles

724
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,230
the finished rolled right it's not like
broccoli or green beans at something

725
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,120
like that

726
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:22,049
in fact the reagan administration got
into a great deal of trouble

727
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:26,029
whenever brady should rules for school
lunches in which they classified pickle

728
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:29,549
relish as a vegetable

729
00:34:29,549 --> 00:34:32,839
augsburg for purposes of counting
whether kids were getting bashed ables

730
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:33,589
or not

731
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:34,790
so i can

732
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:39,990
one of the problems here is that there
are many familiar categories

733
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,919
and many familiar objects

734
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:45,429
whose category membership is on clear

735
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,770
this is actually

736
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,859
the source of an important of a very
interesting legal problem

737
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:53,320
bad weather a tomato is a fruit a
revenge triple

738
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,999
who says it's meals a fruit

739
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:58,809
who says a tomatoes a vegetable

740
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:01,720
asi there is another one

741
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,270
indeed terrorist activity american
tariff act of eighteen thirty three

742
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,950
all of the imposed a double duty import
duty on vegetables imported to this

743
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,559
country in their natural state

744
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,279
but there was no duty on fruits

745
00:35:16,279 --> 00:35:19,459
the customs collector for the port of
new york

746
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:23,609
declared tomatoes to be vegetables for
the purposes of collecting

747
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:26,199
all of this import duty

748
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:30,799
i swear this is true there was an
organizational as the international

749
00:35:30,799 --> 00:35:33,739
tomato cartel

750
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:37,260
which so would it be customs collector
for the port of new york

751
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,719
claiming the tomatoes were fruits and
therefore not subject

752
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,400
to this import duty

753
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,129
a case of went all the way to the
supreme court

754
00:35:46,129 --> 00:35:50,379
fair in a decision written by mister
just as great

755
00:35:50,379 --> 00:35:54,599
he concluded that but honestly speaking
tomatoes are the fruit of the ball

756
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,719
bovine

757
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,970
but in the common language of the people

758
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:03,560
these are all vegetable like potatoes
carrots and lettuce usually served at

759
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,559
dinner in the width or after

760
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,299
the small fisherman's

761
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:10,250
which constitute the principal part of
the repairs

762
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,950
and not as fruits

763
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:16,559
generally hasn't developed

764
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:18,229
when you look at it

765
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:20,220
what you see that

766
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:26,049
justice gray is not alkaline thought
proper set notion of categorization here

767
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:26,670
okay

768
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,479
he's the clarion

769
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:31,089
tomatoes to be vegetables

770
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:32,569
even though you know once

771
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:34,859
that vegetables or fruits

772
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,329
and why is he declaring tomatoes to be
vegetables

773
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:42,219
because we're treat them as vegetables
they seem to go with vegetables you put

774
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:49,219
tomatoes on your cell that you do output
tomatoes on your cornflakes

775
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,640
we concert tomatoes to be vegetables on
but that although on and and that's and

776
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,299
that's basically the way it is

777
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,619
what u

778
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:01,409
one other point one of the problems with
this

779
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:03,490
proper set view of categorization

780
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:07,099
is that it's sometimes very difficult to
specify

781
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,420
the defining features all of

782
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,409
categories that are familiar to us

783
00:37:12,409 --> 00:37:16,329
we use certain categories all the time
but if you put a gun you're head and

784
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:20,819
said tell me what the segue necessary in
jointly sufficient defining features are

785
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:23,319
you would have a lot of difficulty

786
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:26,679
the classic example is the concept of
game

787
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:31,529
of want something that the philosopher
victim stein worried about a lot if u

788
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:32,279
workup

789
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:34,870
detainment in the are dictionary

790
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,230
you find it defined as

791
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,920
competitive physical or mental activity
engaged in for amusement

792
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,049
okay

793
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:44,550
which is fine

794
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:48,089
except that there are lots of things
that we classify his games that don't

795
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:50,650
fit this at this uh... definition

796
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,150
likes solitaire

797
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,259
solitaire there's no competition

798
00:37:55,259 --> 00:38:02,069
you're not even competing with yourself
rated sensitivities

799
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:05,109
their children's game of women around
the rosy

800
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:06,200
has no winner

801
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,780
you can't win ring around the rosy right
now just it's not possible to bring it

802
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,379
uh... yet

803
00:38:12,379 --> 00:38:16,800
children play this game hours and hours
and hours on end

804
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,759
and then you can take something like
professional football

805
00:38:19,759 --> 00:38:20,670
which is not

806
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,939
a source of amusement

807
00:38:22,939 --> 00:38:25,970
its work it's hard work people get hurt

808
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,210
and so on

809
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,720
are there's nothing funny about
professional of nothing funny about

810
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,829
professional football

811
00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:37,199
so i can the prod the point here

812
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:39,690
sometimes very difficult to specify

813
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:44,609
just what it is that makes a game a gain

814
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:46,799
nevertheless this is a concept

815
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:48,849
that we use quite frequently

816
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:51,289
it's a concept with which were all

817
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:52,280
are familiar

818
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,829
here's a more recent example

819
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:55,969
the concept of planet

820
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:57,940
you looked that up in the dictionary

821
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,950
and you see planets defined as

822
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:06,150
a celestial body that revolves around a
star but does not revolve around another

823
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,279
celestial

824
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:12,939
that's a perfectly fine definition
planet except when you start considering

825
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:16,210
that there are lots of things that seem
to meet this definition

826
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,170
that we don't want to call planets

827
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,540
like need yours

828
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,919
okay which revolve around celestial body
okay

829
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:25,319
fine

830
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:29,539
but we're not going to admit media risk
into the category of planets

831
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:30,760
comets too

832
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,450
okay

833
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,290
and then they are objects in our solar
system like series which is as big a

834
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,319
hunger rock out there between jupiter
and saturn

835
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:43,789
all and this anew a planet dot sometimes
known as veto

836
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:50,789
all that all of the orbit so i won't be
on the orbit all vocal pluto

837
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:53,010
discovery of series ends in a row

838
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:57,199
created a definitional crisis for
restaurant owners

839
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,489
because they will realize that the
concept of planet that they've been

840
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:05,690
working with since the time for the
astrologers just didn't work any longer

841
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:06,819
okay

842
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:07,530
although

843
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:13,300
and especially have this problem of or
pluto pluto just doesn't look like any

844
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,219
of the other planets okay

845
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:17,279
it's real small

846
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:19,950
it's very far-out in the solar system

847
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:25,100
it has is very wierd orbit but doesn't
look like any of the other orbits uh...

848
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,959
in nam

849
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:28,299
uh... of the home of the planets

850
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:30,029
so we have these objects

851
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:33,469
that fit the definition of a plan of a
planet but we don't want to call them

852
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:34,890
plucked

853
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,839
and then we have this object that we
call a planet

854
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,669
that doesn't really fit the definition
of

855
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:42,089
the category

856
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:44,799
so what happened couple years ago

857
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:46,030
actually last year

858
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:50,800
all the concept of planet god redefine
they were actually fist fights at the

859
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,880
international astronomical union

860
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,159
about how to define planet

861
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,760
also we now have

862
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,990
plan is defined as

863
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,809
an object that orbits the sun

864
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:05,409
with enough gravity to compress its
fears with that gets rid of series which

865
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:07,170
is not spherical

866
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:11,059
and enough gravity to clear it's orval
neighborhood that gets reduced our

867
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:13,799
series but it also go through pluto

868
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:14,630
okay

869
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,150
also the pluto is no longer a planet

870
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,070
because it doesn't have enough gravity

871
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,880
to clear it so

872
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,049
it's horrible on the neighborhood

873
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:27,550
this is a problem that is still being
confronted by astronomers okay

874
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:31,599
the next meeting of the international
astronomical union two thousand nine

875
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,019
is going to take up the definition of a
planet again

876
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:41,079
now astronomers have been doing their
business for or really long time

877
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:45,259
and they still can't figure out what a
planet is

878
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:48,049
this is not a criticism of astronomers

879
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:53,819
this is just a really good example of
how sometimes it's very difficult to

880
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:54,399
specify

881
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:56,969
the defining features

882
00:41:56,969 --> 00:41:58,339
categories

883
00:41:58,339 --> 00:41:59,680
yet another problem

884
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,880
with these traditional definition of
categories categorization

885
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,450
is a phenomenon known as in perfect
nesting

886
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,139
think about are nicely nested

887
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:15,930
categorization of animals and a fish and
birds and birds into

888
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,380
examples of birds

889
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,539
subtypes likes peril and chicken

890
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,219
according too

891
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:26,420
proper said fuel categorization

892
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,719
it should be

893
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:32,809
it's easiest to identify an object as an
instance of a

894
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:34,330
closely adjacent category

895
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,459
so it turns out to be easier to identify
this peril as a bird

896
00:42:38,459 --> 00:42:41,649
that it is to identify a sparrow as an
animal

897
00:42:41,649 --> 00:42:46,969
subjects will take less time to identify
a sparrow as a bird than they will

898
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:48,180
identify espero

899
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,349
as an animal

900
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:51,979
because these categories or further away

901
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:56,989
but quite the opposite happens when u_s_
people dot chickens

902
00:42:56,989 --> 00:42:59,970
people have a lot of difficulty they
take a long time

903
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,469
to identify a chicken

904
00:43:01,469 --> 00:43:02,470
as a bird

905
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,550
but they take a look at least short time

906
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:08,089
to identify of chicken as an animal

907
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:09,570
part of the other way

908
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,829
chechans

909
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:16,329
are represented mentally as animals but
not as birds even doctrines are birds

910
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:17,869
the concept of chicken

911
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:20,339
is in perfectly nested

912
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,940
the category

913
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,609
and then finally related to this

914
00:43:26,609 --> 00:43:30,659
we have variations in what's known as
typical ality

915
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:33,529
uh... in the home elegant inn
categorization

916
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:36,479
i've already alluded to one of these
variations

917
00:43:36,479 --> 00:43:42,659
pluto just doesn't seem to be like the
other planets ok it's not a typical

918
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:43,659
planet

919
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:47,119
mars and venus and jupiter their typical
planets

920
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:47,880
similarly

921
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,239
if u_s_ people what up to two name
typical birds

922
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:53,530
build name

923
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,699
words like sparrows and robbins and
evils

924
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:58,800
but they will not name

925
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,040
words like

926
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,509
chickens

927
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:01,890
and aust riches

928
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,399
and penguins

929
00:44:04,399 --> 00:44:07,430
even though they're all warm blue
blooded vertebrates

930
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:10,539
with feathers and wings

931
00:44:10,539 --> 00:44:13,119
valuation untypical ality

932
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,019
among the members all the category

933
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:17,920
creates problems for them

934
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,259
proper said view of categorization

935
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:21,180
because

936
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:25,069
from not point of view of the proper
said fuel categorization

937
00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:26,710
categories are homogeneous

938
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:29,900
all instances of a category are equally
glued

939
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,680
members of what category

940
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,089
but that's evidently not true everybody
agrees

941
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,770
that a sparrow is a better example of
the category bird

942
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,389
than it should do this

943
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:42,140
okay everybody agrees about that

944
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:46,379
a sparrow is simply a more a birdie bird

945
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:47,739
then triggered this

946
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:51,299
here is some data collected by the
barclays own eleanor rauscher was a

947
00:44:51,299 --> 00:44:52,960
pioneer

948
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,169
involved would lead us to change our
understanding of categories

949
00:44:56,169 --> 00:44:58,489
here are some typical

950
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:03,839
categories furniture vegetable bird and
fruit she presented her subjects with

951
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,340
instances of these categories

952
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,349
and simply as subjects to rape

953
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:09,440
howard an example

954
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,619
each of these instances

955
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:13,330
so that people think chair

956
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:15,709
is a really good example of our of

957
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:16,950
of furniture

958
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,429
but ashtray he is not

959
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:23,410
abroad gets a very

960
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:27,589
pete and corn there are very good
examples a vegetable

961
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:29,300
tomato is a pretty good example

962
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:33,219
all vegetable remember tomatoes not
vegetable

963
00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:33,999
okay

964
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:38,439
but we think tomato was a much better
example vegetables in a pickle is

965
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:40,960
for example all and fruit

966
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,700
okay we actually think a pickle has a
better example of fruit

967
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,940
then a tomato is

968
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:52,179
on here bird sparrow was a much better
example rate a much better example of

969
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:53,630
then chicken is

970
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:57,249
now you can say okay what he's a weird
categories

971
00:45:57,249 --> 00:46:02,829
here it is work cargo right your own
textbooks author andrea lilac live and

972
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:05,019
work in the decline of our graduate
student

973
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:06,699
where we take examples

974
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:10,539
of categories that are clearly proper
sets

975
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:13,440
and again present subjects with examples
of them

976
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,249
and ask them to raise how puttin example
they are

977
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:18,099
subjects think

978
00:46:18,099 --> 00:46:23,930
that the number four is a better example
of the category even number

979
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:24,640
then the number-two

980
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,869
annul sixes

981
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:30,040
they think that the number three is a
better example

982
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,009
of the category pod number

983
00:46:32,009 --> 00:46:35,299
than the number four hundred and forty
seven is

984
00:46:35,299 --> 00:46:39,769
they think the squares and rectangles
are better examples of plane geometry

985
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:40,319
figures

986
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,069
denny ellipses are

987
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:44,239
and i think that mothers and housewives

988
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,580
are better examples of the category
female then princesses

989
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,019
or police women are

990
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:53,359
all of these instances

991
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:54,379
jerry incumbent

992
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:59,919
the singling necessary and jointly
sufficient defining features of category

993
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:00,829
membership

994
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:03,400
and everybody recognizes that

995
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,220
everybody recognizes that these are that
these are

996
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,949
classic instances a proper sense

997
00:47:08,949 --> 00:47:10,909
nevertheless

998
00:47:10,909 --> 00:47:12,259
people

999
00:47:12,259 --> 00:47:13,859
perceive

1000
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:15,549
differences into the calorie

1001
00:47:15,549 --> 00:47:19,110
within these categories that she would
not occur

1002
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:22,880
if we think about categories and proper
sense

1003
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,469
why does this happen

1004
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:28,849
the factors of here's another good
example this or ed smith and his

1005
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:29,450
colleagues

1006
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:32,150
as subjects to classify

1007
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:37,839
highly typical medium for the kelly a
low typical objects

1008
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,950
arctic sibal lot less time

1009
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,160
took tickled to categorize a highly
typical

1010
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,160
instance of a allah category

1011
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,259
as opposed to an atypical instance of
the category

1012
00:47:49,259 --> 00:47:51,260
typically affects in calories they
should

1013
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,329
are any real problem

1014
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,029
it turns out

1015
00:47:55,029 --> 00:47:57,369
none of these problems what occurred

1016
00:47:57,369 --> 00:48:00,020
if we actually used

1017
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:03,489
algorithms in the process of
categorization

1018
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:06,559
none of those problems would occur we
wouldn't have any it difficult to know

1019
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,809
whether or raw does nordica love
furniture

1020
00:48:08,809 --> 00:48:11,699
or whether it tomato was approved or a
vegetable

1021
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:15,160
the fact that these problems do occur

1022
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:15,690
suggests

1023
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:16,859
that way

1024
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:18,039
actually

1025
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:18,969
categorize objects

1026
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:21,060
in a way that's quite different

1027
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,269
from the logical

1028
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:24,729
rational

1029
00:48:24,729 --> 00:48:27,360
algorithm implied by the proper set

1030
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,490
view of categories

1031
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,059
apparently

1032
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:36,459
or mental concepts are not structured
like proper sets after all

1033
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:37,600
and on wednesday

1034
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,419
i'll tell you how they are structured

1035
00:48:40,419 --> 00:48:41,569
thank you very much

1036
00:48:41,569 --> 00:48:42,369
i'll see you on wednesday
