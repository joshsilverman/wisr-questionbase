1
00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:10,489
okay

2
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:14,779
last time we focused our

3
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,510
discussion of and thanking

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,279
on

5
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,710
deed normative rational choice model
forward judgment and decision making

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,679
and the psalm exceptions to the

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,089
rational choice model

8
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:32,780
that type of form of these various
judgement she respects

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,790
let's review the bidding for a second
and just remind you

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,050
that according to the normative model
altered went and decision making this

11
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,630
couple down to us

12
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,850
through about twenty five hundred years
the fa la sutti

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,380
human beings

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,440
rational human beings make judgments
based on logic

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,520
and based on the laws of probability

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,620
decisions rational decisions are always
decisions made in the self-interest of

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,860
the decision maker that is

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,730
you do it you just make decisions that
are good for you

19
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:11,300
regardless of whether they're good for
somebody else that's rationality define

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,360
self-interest is defined in terms of a
principle of optimality the basically

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,160
says

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,610
it's in the

23
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,310
rational self-interest of the decision
maker

24
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,840
to maximize his or her games

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,439
and minimize his or her losses

26
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,229
and rational self-interest is also

27
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:30,420
all

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,610
on displayed in a principle of utility

29
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,909
that basically says

30
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,389
you want to maximize games and minimize
losses

31
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:42,440
in the most efficient way possible

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,229
these

33
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,200
ideas these principles

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,110
give us

35
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,720
what me think of in economics

36
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,710
as the doctrine of rational choice okay

37
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,440
and here's another view of

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,579
rational choice

39
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,500
comes through from read hasty and robin
doors to

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,090
written uh... wonderful book on this
topic

41
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,710
is his first off

42
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,870
rational choice is what is one of the
based on

43
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,300
the decision makers current assets

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,079
but things that he or she hasn't and
right now

45
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:17,340
not what you might have in the future
will come to that the second

46
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,159
and not what you had in the past but
what you have

47
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,420
the second point

48
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,840
is a rational choices are based on

49
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,150
possible consequences of a choice ok you
don't know rational choices are made

50
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,360
all in terms of

51
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,359
good choices are bad choices in the
abstract but rather

52
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:43,239
rational choices are defined in solely
in terms of their consequences

53
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,279
and when the consequences are uncertain

54
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:50,269
but sometimes the consequences of a
choice or really clear if i'm going to

55
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:51,359
kick

56
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:56,049
this podium i'm going to hurt my toe
okay we know that that's the case

57
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:57,920
all but sometimes

58
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,170
consequences are uncertain

59
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,379
and then inr

60
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:05,199
or rational decision maker will evaluate
these consequences based on a

61
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,609
probability theory

62
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:08,090
and then basically

63
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,780
all of and any rational choice

64
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,619
is by definition adaptive

65
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:17,229
also along with its constrained by the
probabilities

66
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:21,790
that are available okay so long as is
constrained by the actual probabilities

67
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,439
all of these outcomes

68
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,210
and the values associated with each of

69
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,369
these aliquot okay so that's what a
rational choice is all about

70
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:35,379
and as i say it's up to sun normative
description if you will to maybe a

71
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:36,240
prescription

72
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,770
of how people all up to make choices if
they're going to be havea rationally in

73
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,969
the world

74
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:43,639
it turns out however

75
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,260
that there are a number of ways in which
we violate

76
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,879
wonder another of these precepts of
rational choice

77
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,819
some of them

78
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,540
could just think of kind kind of come up
with on da on introspection

79
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,029
sometimes we make choices out of habit

80
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:03,369
when i go to my closet and i pick out
the shirt dot i'm going to wear on a

81
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:08,379
particular day all i'm they say it all
you know i wore the shirt last week are

82
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:11,519
all i have a moral issue of the wild
issued story or whatever

83
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,559
at a rational way of thinking about your
but if i suppose there are really what

84
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,549
blue shirts

85
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,609
alm dot is just making a choice i would
have had

86
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:27,599
or to choose on the basis of conformity
to make choices just because of other

87
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,620
people are making that choice

88
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,770
or just because alm

89
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,520
that is the most frequent choice the
people make

90
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,800
is not irrational way of making a choice
because it's based on what other people

91
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,740
do

92
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,229
not on what you are rational
self-interest is

93
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:45,630
and then finally

94
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,080
making choices on the basis of what of
parties say you shouldn't do

95
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,000
also

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,860
not is also a departure from rationality
again because one of parties say you

97
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,770
should do

98
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,680
might or might not be in your
self-interest

99
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,610
rational choices

100
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,260
are always justices

101
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,629
that maximize

102
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:05,270
that users games

103
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,709
and minimize the troopers losses

104
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:12,669
so if you simply make the choices that
say or religious authorities are

105
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,420
cultural ortiz make you do

106
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,129
that may be a religious act

107
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:20,039
that may be a culturally bulb
appropriate act

108
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:21,419
but it's not rational

109
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,060
within the of within the definition

110
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,319
of rational choice theory

111
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,740
finally last time

112
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,789
i described for you a number of judgment
heuristics

113
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:34,700
rules of twelve

114
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,719
shortcut

115
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,249
decisionmaking routines

116
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:40,660
that we on for you know why i brought it
circumstances

117
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:46,870
to categorize objects made judgments of
similarity make estimates make all

118
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,639
predictions about probability and
causality

119
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,069
all about

120
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,490
judgments and frequency

121
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,669
all of that we used commonly

122
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:55,349
all which

123
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:58,009
in one way or another also

124
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:00,219
violate the principles of rational
choice

125
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:02,029
and these are

126
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,250
departures from rational choice

127
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,250
all are not obvious

128
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,540
okay it's not obvious that the way that

129
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,650
making choices a lot of habit is
irrational

130
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,159
colleges are is obvious

131
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:16,149
but there are departures that are all

132
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:17,490
on discovered for us

133
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,330
by psychological research

134
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,560
but a person who's been more in this
last lecture on judgment and decision

135
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,100
making on thinking but before i do

136
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,060
i want to see if there are any questions
left over from last time

137
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,809
about these four

138
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:37,340
comic judgment teristics represented a
mess we're judgments are based on

139
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,919
degree resemblance to a degree of
similarity

140
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:41,509
availability

141
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,180
we're judgments are made

142
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,969
based on the ease of retrieving
instances from memory

143
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:48,740
simulation

144
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,210
where judgments are

145
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,750
made based on the ease in which you
could imagine something happening

146
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,099
and anchoring an adjustment where
judgments are made based on

147
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:00,400
early date of return

148
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,690
okay basically as well

149
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,819
but that's what what

150
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,840
any questions about these

151
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:11,840
judgment teristics

152
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:21,889
okay what's the difference between
represented in this and availability

153
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:23,780
on in representative as

154
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,870
you're always basing the making
judgments based on the appearance of

155
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,800
things

156
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,549
what things look like

157
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:32,430
whether they resemble

158
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,610
something else

159
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,269
so for example in the birth problem

160
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:40,939
want to ask you which was the most
likely sequence of boys and girls and a

161
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:42,740
six child family

162
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,599
all there's a tendency to choose

163
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,499
girl boy girl boy boy girl

164
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,699
park that was the example if it was

165
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:50,569
all because

166
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,849
that's the one that looks random

167
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,389
it's the one that looks right it's going
to need a mix of boys and girls that are

168
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,740
kind of old interspersed together

169
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,370
where raza sequence of three girls
followed by three boys is just as likely

170
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,319
given probability theory

171
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,249
and for that matter a sequence of six
points

172
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:10,500
just as likely

173
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,929
what probability theory is like but
still

174
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:15,240
is represented as we make

175
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,869
decisions based on how things look

176
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:20,930
that's quite different from on undaunted

177
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,789
the availability to respect

178
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:27,439
where the operating principle is not so
much of what resembles watcher or or the

179
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,129
appearance of things

180
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:32,740
how fast things come to mind

181
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,340
alm

182
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,950
i'll give you an example for almost

183
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,919
self-rule part of the public welfare

184
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,060
all people who were on employed

185
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,980
think the unemployment rate is a lot
harder

186
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,260
than people who

187
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,380
unemployed

188
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,370
and the reason that people the the
reason that happens the people who are

189
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,190
unemployed

190
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,150
know a lot of other unemployed people

191
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,050
they meet them in the appointed office
they meet them on what they had come to

192
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,949
the mo when they go to apply for jobs
they got me

193
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:01,949
and talk to them when they're called
registering for welfare benefits and

194
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:02,829
things like that

195
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:05,680
so it's easy for them to bring to mind

196
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,670
all mots of instances of people who are
unemployed

197
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,920
but it that none of these judgment based
on the resemblance between

198
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,900
someone employed person and some other
unemployed person is just a matter row

199
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,570
how resilient could bring instances wine
so it's really

200
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,510
more like retrievals speed

201
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,370
what you retrieve

202
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:34,370
anything else about these teristics yes

203
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,960
does availability views of the
availability heuristic also depend on

204
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,889
how recent the instances

205
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:47,379
well yes in the following away

206
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,470
because something that happened recently

207
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,180
is going to be fresher in memory

208
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,990
than something that happened sometime
ago probably

209
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,100
okay

210
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,160
and so

211
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,920
on pure relying on their you're on the
uh... work with on the availability to

212
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,310
respect

213
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,269
your judgments are most likely are are
likely to be biased by the most recent

214
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:09,660
thing that happened with the most recent
i mean fought about

215
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,370
sov about something like that

216
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,490
so again

217
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,350
yet you've got something that's just
recently happened it's fresh in memory

218
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,749
all of that's going to be easily
retrieve from memory just by virtue of

219
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:21,250
being fresh

220
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,560
all and that thing is going to bias

221
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,930
uh... by richard road

222
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,149
exactly exactly right

223
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:31,829
that's because the availability to
respect is based on rick and ease of

224
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,210
retrieval from memory

225
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,920
and anything

226
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,080
any factor

227
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,210
affects

228
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,760
ease of retrieval for memory

229
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,700
is going to affect their judgment

230
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:49,700
anything else about these tourist

231
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,650
it does the anc readjustment heuristic
depend solely on dated evidence

232
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,690
yes

233
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,390
but data is defined really broadly

234
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,810
remembering my first example of the off
of the united nations problem i said

235
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,230
ask you what so what's the percentage of
u_n_ members from the comet of africa as

236
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,950
some people say ten percent what do you
say that was data

237
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,980
that some people say ten percent

238
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,550
but in the more radical version of the
question

239
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,630
where i generate that number by the spin
of a roulette wheel

240
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,429
well it's not very cryptic

241
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:27,540
but it's still dated still information

242
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,100
that you've been provided with

243
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,509
by the way they are very good example

244
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:34,550
rb anchoring an adjustment to respective
social cognition

245
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,480
is the privacy of first impressions

246
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,720
it's very difficult to overcome
somebody's first impression of you

247
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,900
it's very difficult for you to overcome
your first impression of somebody else

248
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,279
if your roomate sets you up with a blind
date

249
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,850
and said all we are she's wonderful
she's good luck eighteen inches really

250
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,610
smart and she's very witty and stuff
like that

251
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,440
and then you made a rigid just turns up
like bmp axe murderer or something like

252
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,040
that

253
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,360
your impression of the end of the
biggest she's a very nice axe murderer

254
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,190
i'd stat that's hard to get away from
the initial anchor

255
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,070
by the same token if you need to be
reintroduced to somebody in your during

256
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,780
that period of shoe impression of them
was that there are awful person

257
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,950
weeks and weeks and months and months of
the points is not going to completely

258
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,809
overcome

259
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:23,890
that first impression so there you have
a really good

260
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,210
real-world example

261
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,079
all be anchoring an adjustment your
respect at work

262
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,850
anything else about these

263
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:38,020
let's move on now to talk about another
liability and all in knowledge and uh...

264
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,700
judgment and decision making

265
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,080
that is illustrated

266
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,280
by all of the public phenomenal framing

267
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,029
that it which is the for put on a
framing

268
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,459
illustrated by the disease problem on
another

269
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:53,020
all problem all studied by versity in
common

270
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,110
and it goes like this

271
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,309
you want one general magic that you're a
public health official

272
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:02,410
and you're facing the impending opelika
some deadly disease sorrows

273
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,100
bird flu

274
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,910
something

275
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,380
and based on past experience

276
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,879
on the disease is expected to kill six
hundred people

277
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,970
okay so those are the assumptions going
into the problem

278
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,790
there's this deadly disease

279
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,670
coming soon

280
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,530
and it's expected to kill six hundred
people

281
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,150
so now as a public health officer

282
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,860
you'll have to choose

283
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,580
between

284
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,820
true or alternative programs

285
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,270
that are available to you programming
eight and program be

286
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,340
if program and is adopted

287
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,930
it is a certainty that two hundred
people will be saved

288
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,750
guarantee

289
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,070
that two hundred people will be saved

290
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,680
if program be is adopted

291
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,230
there's a one-in-three chance that all
six hundred will be saved

292
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,880
and attorney one of three chance

293
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,910
that no one

294
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,030
of those individuals will be saved

295
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,730
so those that's the problem

296
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,949
and now the question is

297
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:02,960
which program do you choose

298
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,899
when continents versity

299
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:07,139
posed this problem two subjects

300
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,689
they found that subject

301
00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:11,880
overwhelmingly

302
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,750
preferred

303
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,670
program today

304
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,660
where there was a certainty

305
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,820
that two hundred people will be saved
all of our program be where there was a

306
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,860
one-in-three likelihood

307
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,550
their was that all will be saved and had
to work on the free chance

308
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,310
that dude project is on the three

309
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,720
that no one would be safe

310
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,860
in other words

311
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,809
people overwhelmingly by you

312
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:34,600
what lee

313
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,430
june three two one ratio preserved

314
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:43,089
certain games that although that two
hundred people would be saved to risky

315
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,069
gains that there was some chance

316
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:45,880
that nobody

317
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,090
would be sick

318
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,110
what's interesting about this is

319
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,480
that from the point of view of rational
choice theory

320
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,540
those two choices are precisely
equivalent

321
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,990
because in rational choice theory the
way you are supposed to our value a

322
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,869
choice is is to take a value on the
outcome

323
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:10,410
and multiplied the delicate bianco by
the probability of tax cut that outcome

324
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,140
rational

325
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,720
decision making

326
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,610
you've got a dog they'd be expected
value

327
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,110
obituaries

328
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,920
and multiply it

329
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,570
calculate that by multiplying the value
of the outcome by the probability solar

330
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,719
program and eight

331
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:26,309
if you're certain that two hundred
people will be saved

332
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:29,050
value of the outcome is one

333
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,960
probability of one times two hundred

334
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,050
two hundred

335
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,000
but if you look at program bay

336
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,070
where there's a chance that all will be
saved

337
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,770
value in touch to that is given by

338
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,589
all of them the you know

339
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:45,500
the outcome that six hundred people be
saved

340
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,310
multiplied by the probability of that
outcome

341
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,770
one-third which gives you of value of
two hundred

342
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:57,660
sobil rationally the outcomes of these
two choices are identical

343
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,290
in both

344
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,580
chicago drug cases

345
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,760
your does the your best guess

346
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,410
is the two hundred people are going to
be saved

347
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,689
there's no rational bases

348
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:08,690
for choosing

349
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,710
between the two

350
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,300
so one

351
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,439
conclusion about human judgment that
flows from an experiment like this

352
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:21,980
is that people tend to be risk overs

353
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,490
that in general people pretty far

354
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,780
over they sure thing

355
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,320
to and outcome that has the nearest risk
attached to it

356
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,070
if you say program a it so sure thing
the two hundred lives are going to be

357
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,720
saved

358
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,590
i want that program

359
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,530
on as opposed to one where i say while
there's a one third chance of all be

360
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,589
saved but there's a two-thirds chance

361
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:48,180
that non will be saved

362
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,309
well there's a general idea here

363
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,029
that people tend to be a risk averse

364
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,449
in their decision making

365
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:56,120
they tend to be risk averse

366
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,840
but it turns out said people are not
necessarily risk averse

367
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,630
they will except

368
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,110
some kind of risky outcome

369
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,500
but it all depends on the circumstances
let's continue with the condominium

370
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,440
firstly example here

371
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,519
once you go back in your role as a
public health officer

372
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,600
you're facing the same impending
outbreak of the same disease

373
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,840
that has the same expectation of killing
six hundred people

374
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,160
but now to go to some other subjects

375
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,480
and you say you have to alternative
programs available

376
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,540
offers

377
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,410
program c

378
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,279
if you would drop this program

379
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:38,650
it is a certainty there four hundred
people will die

380
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,010
if you adopt

381
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,120
program d

382
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,030
there is a one-in-three chance

383
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,100
that-and on will die

384
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,260
and that there is a to a lot of three
chances

385
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,390
all bulldog

386
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,350
so here you have certainty program c

387
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:59,670
here you have risky prospects with
program d and which program you choose

388
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,150
it turns out that under this uh... in
this version

389
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,169
of the disease problem

390
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:07,650
people overwhelmingly preferred prefer

391
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,179
the program that has some risk

392
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:11,059
attached to it

393
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:13,559
only about twenty five percent of people

394
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,660
of corporate choose

395
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,080
these certain program where four hundred
people will die

396
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,220
whereas

397
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,019
something like

398
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:24,110
seventy five percent of the all of those
subjects

399
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,150
will prefer the rescue program

400
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,590
where there is anyone in third chance

401
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,130
that or that lol all will die in the to
interject

402
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,360
the chance of not more

403
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,240
so again

404
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,980
if you would if you are value wait these
of outcomes

405
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,899
who are from the perspective of rational
choice theory

406
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:46,010
you'll see that these two outcomes are
also

407
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,920
precisely identical

408
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,860
from the point of view of rational
choice theory and program c

409
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,960
you're certain of four hundred people
will die

410
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,520
the outcome is four hundred deaths

411
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,240
the probability is perfect one point no
so the value was four hundred

412
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,110
for program d where there is some chance

413
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,660
that all will die

414
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,070
the are outcome is six hundred s

415
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,799
the probability of taxes and outcome is
two-thirds

416
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,269
you multiply them out

417
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:16,300
and you get four hundred

418
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,940
again view and rationally

419
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,420
the outcomes of these two choices

420
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:27,039
are precisely identical there's no
reason to shoes one or over the other

421
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,429
yet people do

422
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:29,629
people do

423
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:31,130
prefer in this case

424
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,600
to take a chance

425
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,540
they prefer

426
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,520
the risky

427
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,670
our choice just to put it

428
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,200
more graphically here

429
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,100
if you were in the problem in terms of

430
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,970
how many wives will be saved

431
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,520
people overwhelmingly or risk averse

432
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,300
they preferred a shorter thing

433
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,040
to the rescue prospect

434
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,590
but if you frame

435
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,500
our problem

436
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,080
in terms of how many people are going to
die

437
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,150
the subjects

438
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,669
by almost the same amount

439
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:02,570
overwhelmingly perfer risky

440
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:08,860
a prospect and again just to make it
clear the expected values of these four

441
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,340
programs are all precisely identical

442
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,690
in programming

443
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,809
there's a certainty

444
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:15,529
that two hundred will be saved

445
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:18,330
so there's a certainty that four hundred
will be lost

446
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,620
in program be the or expected outcome is
the two hundred people be

447
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:23,960
calm

448
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,460
i saved four hundred lost

449
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,240
program c there's a certain period of
four hundred will be lost that means two

450
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,750
hundred will be saved and program the
there's a two-thirds chance that all

451
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,840
will be lost

452
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,489
that means that for be expected value

453
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:43,299
is four hundred people wars and to two
hundred people policy

454
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:45,400
before problems art

455
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,690
exactly identical

456
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,739
from the point of view of rational
choice theory ok and so the question now

457
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:52,130
is

458
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,919
not the people risk averse

459
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,459
on that that they want certainty under
some circumstances

460
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,989
we'll take a risk under other
circumstances what's going on here

461
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:06,500
question

462
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,600
hardly ever hardly ever do people br
noticeably that these are exactly the

463
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,450
same

464
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,860
now of course

465
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:19,090
most people have not taken an elementary
economics course either

466
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:19,460
object

467
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,679
this is not something you're talkin'
like the second week ovid elementary

468
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,580
economics course to do these kinds of
calculations

469
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,650
but the general idea behind all of the
rational choice theory is that even

470
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,350
though we haven't had formal training in
economics

471
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,690
you still do something like this

472
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,110
you calculate

473
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,450
the of the probabilities associated with
various outcomes to get the values of

474
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:41,970
them

475
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,870
and apparently people are not doing this

476
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,810
comments first he made themselves quite
famous

477
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,880
alm of and sometimes they would collect
data like this in airport waiting

478
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,560
lounges okay with just ordinary people

479
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,450
but every once in awhile are common

480
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,970
communism important mathematical
psychologists a list first people when

481
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,100
he was a lot of they were going to
meetings of all the american economic

482
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,300
system technician

483
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,630
or the american statistical association
impassable questionnaires worldwide maj

484
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,169
imager public-health officer

485
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:15,980
and people will still do this

486
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,710
train the p_h_d_ level statisticians

487
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,440
and trained p_h_d_ level alban economist

488
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,830
making roughly the same kinds of choices
that you and i would make wendy

489
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,910
uh... begin

490
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,970
okay so what's going on here

491
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,479
armed the under the first thing to
notice

492
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:39,159
is that there's a good there's among
poor indifference in the wording of the

493
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:39,810
problems

494
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,860
their choice between unprogrammed a_t_m_
program be

495
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:49,140
is a choice between two nd programs both
of which focus on

496
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,540
gain

497
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,690
attached to the choice

498
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,120
how many law it will be say

499
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,070
programs see andy

500
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,590
focus on what some

501
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,289
how many lawyers will you lost

502
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:02,549
and it turns out

503
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,309
died when the problem

504
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:06,270
focuses on gain

505
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,960
people tend to prefer assured gain

506
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,470
and they are risk

507
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,310
overs

508
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:15,480
but when the focus of the problem is on
losses

509
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,179
people arrive birth to a certain losses

510
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:19,820
and they prefer to take

511
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,630
or risk

512
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,770
that is just

513
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:29,130
of empirical fact about people's
judgment uh... all uh... behavior

514
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,400
people are not police risk averse

515
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,510
people or risk averse in the context of
games

516
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,649
but they are

517
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:37,110
risk

518
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,639
prone if you will

519
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:40,730
in the context

520
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,790
losses

521
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,970
here's another example something very
similar to the coldest some cost problem

522
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,919
kind of interesting made this one famous
too

523
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:51,980
electoral magic to people attend the
concert

524
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,840
all person a by the regular ticket for
twenty five dollars

525
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,279
person be buys a ticket outside the
concert of hall all from the scalp or

526
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,800
for a hundred dollars

527
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,759
both tickets are nonrefundable

528
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,610
thought the concert when you get in
there the concert turns out to be

529
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,280
terrible

530
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,420
britney isn't even lip sync he well

531
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,710
late-night or something like that

532
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,550
all up and the question is

533
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:21,070
which concert goer is more likely to
leave

534
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,310
egg is more likely to leave

535
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,340
day is going to say

536
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,820
i paid off hundred dollars for this
ticket i'm sticking it out

537
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,420
portrayed

538
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,240
but the problem is you've already spent
that money

539
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,390
the money is

540
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:35,899
gun

541
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:39,909
if you make a rational choice based on
what's in hand once again this is

542
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:42,159
terrible concert

543
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,929
and you should just get out of there

544
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:46,440
it only turns out

545
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,979
that it depends on

546
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:49,430
how you've got in

547
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,690
to this

548
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,140
situation sunk cost

549
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,570
alton the reasoning

550
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,820
is something that you see a lot of
economic decision making it's a kind of

551
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,610
thing that you see also

552
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,570
in political

553
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,380
uh... decision making

554
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,000
when an investor

555
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,100
on invests in a stock

556
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,529
and then the bottom falls out of the
stock and the investor said on the

557
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:15,320
refuses to sell the stock because had
might go up

558
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,920
that's the part that some cause behavior

559
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,480
when a military leader was is a battle

560
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,759
and sends more soldiers into the battle
okay because

561
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:29,350
well just lost a lot of sold but also in
some more soldiers in that some cost

562
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,669
kind of behavior

563
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:33,950
instead of making choices based on at
synechron

564
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,750
you make choices based on that history
of how u

565
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,080
got into it

566
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,350
disease problem

567
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,210
and the some cost problem

568
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:49,350
are both examples of a broad phenomenon
known as framing affects

569
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,729
and

570
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:54,130
the importance of framing affects is
that they shall s

571
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:59,030
judgments are not invariant over a
different descriptions of a problem

572
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,720
in a rational choice theory

573
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,140
judgments are simply are not a rugby
algebra

574
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,630
outcall multiplied by probability

575
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,109
it doesn't matter

576
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,080
how the problem is worded

577
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,139
outcome multiplied by probability is all
you should do

578
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:18,410
it's exclaims white equals z and you
compare

579
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:18,840
disease

580
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,290
and it doesn't matter hollow the problem
is described

581
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,630
all rational choice

582
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,789
is a abstract

583
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:28,070
principle

584
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,480
decision making

585
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,620
so again

586
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,800
the fact that

587
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,669
there are at least framing affects in
judgment and decision making

588
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:37,370
violates normative rationality

589
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,809
because of the principle of rational
choice

590
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,309
that rational choices ardent order are
determined

591
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,860
by end abstract representation of the
problem they're supposed to be

592
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,679
determined

593
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,160
by the algebra

594
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,679
and they shouldn't be they shouldn't
depend

595
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,970
on how problems word

596
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,530
but we know that's the case

597
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,039
we know that from the disease problem
and we also know that

598
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,940
from things like

599
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,740
the song we are some calls

600
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,529
but trying to explain these

601
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:07,250
alm

602
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,060
kinds of affects

603
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,730
condominiums for ski

604
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,000
advanced an alternative to of or the
restaurant choice theory

605
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,090
which they called prospect theory

606
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,450
and more than anything else it's this
theory that one forget economy

607
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,840
the home nobel prize in in economics

608
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,980
first we couldn't get it because he was
deceased in nobel doesn't go to

609
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,280
all deceased people

610
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,890
and prospects theory

611
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,709
is a psychological approach

612
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:38,650
not on that matter kal approach

613
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,549
it's a psychological approach

614
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:43,040
the human judgment and decision making

615
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,559
that attends the capture

616
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,850
how people actually make judgments

617
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,759
rather than

618
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,770
hollow they might make judgments

619
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,539
in some kind of abstract world and the
first thing

620
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:59,160
is that people base their judgments on
the subject of utilities

621
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,080
not on objective values

622
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,279
so for example

623
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,770
if you give me anti-choice between

624
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,260
forming ten dollars

625
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,780
and eight ten percent chance to win a
hundred dollars

626
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,919
their equivalent

627
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:19,120
mathematically certainty of ten dollars

628
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,330
versus of one in ten chance of winning a
hundred dollars

629
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,059
valuable those choices ten dollars but
that's all i want is a sandwich for

630
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,780
lunch

631
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,930
all take the certain ten dollars got
back at smith a sandwich

632
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:35,240
if i'd but if i lose a hundred dollars

633
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,060
i go under it

634
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:40,750
so it's the subjective utility that
matters here

635
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,020
not the objective of value of the choice

636
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,330
the second is

637
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,549
we don't multiply

638
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:48,650
all balanced

639
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,910
by object of probabilities

640
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:56,370
rather we multiply utilities by

641
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,309
subjective

642
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:01,110
probabilities and by which all of the by
which kind of interested means

643
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,070
that we tend to all overweight

644
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,039
very high and very well risks

645
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,419
very lol risks

646
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:09,840
looking better

647
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,710
then they were really are

648
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,630
okay

649
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,559
very high risks tend to appear

650
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:16,269
worse

651
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:17,540
then they really are

652
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,010
we overweight

653
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,980
very high

654
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,600
and very

655
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,830
or very very well risks

656
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,000
all

657
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,179
of so that

658
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:29,460
again it's not what the that's not what
the mathematical probability is that

659
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,460
it's attached to it

660
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,870
if or did you

661
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,529
of the probability is another

662
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:36,490
uh... example of framing

663
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,889
and then finally

664
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:40,539
we don't have a value weight utilities

665
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:42,899
in some kind of absolute sense

666
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,049
remember rational choice theory says

667
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,979
that decision should be made by you

668
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:47,950
on the basis of

669
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,299
what is ian and right

670
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:52,029
instead

671
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:53,200
we tend to

672
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,000
of value wait our utilities against

673
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,610
psalm reference point

674
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,360
okay

675
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,010
although

676
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,340
i paid ten dollars for the stick a
personal appeal hundred dollars for this

677
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,460
ticket

678
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,320
or or or whatever

679
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,620
for any effects

680
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,140
off that these

681
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,570
valle of the these reference points

682
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,299
so if i you know the disease problem

683
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:18,660
framed in terms of lights to be saved
that will change the reference point

684
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,929
if i give you the same problem

685
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:23,100
framed in terms of whites to be lost

686
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,549
that will also

687
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:25,820
alter the reference point

688
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,789
so again

689
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:33,420
what happens here is that framing org
frame it affects will make prospects

690
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,539
or worse

691
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:35,929
then they really are

692
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:39,620
if i say it's a sure thing the two
hundred lives are going to be saved

693
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,120
that looks better than it really is

694
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,980
if i say it's a sure thing

695
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,860
that four hundred wives are going to be
lost

696
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:51,240
that's bad naf it looks worse that it
really is

697
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,300
hull d

698
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,590
or the other companies represented
mentally

699
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,909
not how the outcome

700
00:30:56,909 --> 00:30:58,480
is calculated

701
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,440
mathematically that really makes radio
really makes a difference here

702
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,950
so let's stop for a second and take any
questions you might have

703
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:13,950
about the disease problem and framing
effects

704
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:35,130
doesn't the fact that you're only making
the decision ones

705
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,470
alter open situation well no apparently
not

706
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,260
because that's how the that's how the
problems framed and if you think about

707
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,830
albeit a public health officer

708
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,320
in all-stars only comes around once

709
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,120
you know maybe if you're lucky

710
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,990
uh...

711
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,289
so when stars starts coming around here

712
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:55,530
you have bob the background on what we
know from

713
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,020
your some other place vietnam urself
tried or wherever we're we're worth

714
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,809
resources already added no break is that
what

715
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:05,799
we can predict that we're going to lose
six hundred people here there are two

716
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,930
different things you can do

717
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,360
so you don't repeat these things over
and over and over again

718
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,960
all again

719
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,509
from the point of view all rational
choice

720
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:20,600
you only make decisions based on what is
in hand

721
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,690
and what's in hand right now with

722
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,360
there's a disease coming

723
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,230
it's expected the kill six hundred
people and you have these two programs

724
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:29,850
available

725
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,280
one which has

726
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,440
certain prospects

727
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,010
and one which has risky prosper

728
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,460
doesn't seem to matter

729
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,340
there are lots of variance on the
disease problem

730
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,510
lots and lots of errands on the disease
problem

731
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,570
and the outcome is almost always

732
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,100
something like this

733
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,690
how you've framed choices

734
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,850
is going to determine

735
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:54,130
what choices made and that shouldn't
happen

736
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,980
according to russia which we theory

737
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,080
because according to rational choices

738
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,150
our choices are always determined by and
abstract description of the problem

739
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,520
explains why

740
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:12,520
question doctor

741
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,060
well they work well

742
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,470
quality

743
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,070
it's not me

744
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,470
by disease buffet breakfast

745
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,539
but the choices are exactly the same

746
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:34,160
from the point of view of rational
choice theory

747
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,289
because rational choice theory says

748
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:40,330
or rational decision maker will take the
value of the outcome

749
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:44,630
and multiply it by the probable take the
outcome and multiplied by the

750
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:48,530
probability of tax that outcome to
calculate the value

751
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:52,960
what rational choice theory says people
want to do

752
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,740
again

753
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,460
if they re

754
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,050
if the two choices don't seem like
they're the same

755
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,190
your right

756
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,460
they don't

757
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,250
seem like they're the same

758
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,510
but from the point of view of rational
choice theory

759
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,560
they or precisely

760
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,509
mathematically identical

761
00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:12,510
the fact that yeah you are

762
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,209
but they don't look that way

763
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:16,659
i was just something interesting

764
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:21,069
our judgments are based on how things
luck

765
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:21,980
not by

766
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,969
he's kinds of calculations okay

767
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,270
if the departure

768
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,810
from normative rationality

769
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:28,649
but in fact

770
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:33,539
the to joyce is are precisely the same
mathematically just

771
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:40,539
just in the old river

772
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,899
when you do the expected value per se
the op-ed hog

773
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,329
the probability is one

774
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:51,950
because of the program c

775
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,719
it is certain that four hundred people
will die

776
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,719
so with one times four hundred

777
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:00,049
okay people's four hundred

778
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:00,699
and then

779
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:05,529
in program d there's a two-thirds chance
that all will die so it's two thirds

780
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:08,769
time six hundred equals four hundred

781
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:15,769
one more question i'm going to finish

782
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:20,760
aren't there a waiter frame the problem
that would lead people to make

783
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,639
overall rover actual choice

784
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,809
uh...

785
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:30,099
it would be interesting i don't know
whether anybody's done this but

786
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:31,929
what you are what you might do

787
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,869
is to

788
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:38,249
present people with all four of those
choices at once

789
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:42,129
if your present and people with all four
of those choices of once they might be

790
00:35:42,129 --> 00:35:47,169
big mike think about the program word
does about the choices were deeply

791
00:35:47,169 --> 00:35:47,619
vendor

792
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:50,039
than they do

793
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:50,530
hong

794
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:55,180
but again

795
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,329
one of the

796
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,880
points of this whole analysis of
judgment tourist x

797
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,959
is it simply

798
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:05,369
about some of the liabilities of human
judgment will help people be call more

799
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:07,469
rational decision makers

800
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:10,369
so that knowing something about the the
yacht

801
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:13,950
the framing effects in the disease
problem the next time you're actually

802
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,769
faced with a problem like this

803
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:16,859
you'll say

804
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:21,459
well you know these really there's
really not a very good choice

805
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:22,819
and then you might go

806
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:25,020
you might make your choice based on

807
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,289
all other values

808
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:31,569
for example you might say

809
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:34,559
by third if there is program and there's
a

810
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,689
there's a certain do the two hundred
lives will be saved

811
00:36:37,689 --> 00:36:39,589
that looks like a better

812
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:40,880
game to me

813
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,229
then the risky one

814
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:43,829
it's not

815
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:44,609
mathematically

816
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:48,210
but if you are a public health official
for example

817
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:50,309
responsible to the voters you might say

818
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,739
i made the choice

819
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:54,779
gave me a guaranteed uncle

820
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,519
that you'd like

821
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,210
and that's what the principle thing

822
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,329
but that's not all rational choice

823
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:03,739
that such a record not and barb russian
choice in the case in the in the

824
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:08,229
framework of rational choice theory that
may be a correct choice

825
00:37:08,229 --> 00:37:11,489
i trusted you could defend to the voters

826
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:14,749
the fact of the matter is that the
choice between two

827
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:17,859
programs that are mathematically
equivalent

828
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:18,750
let's finish this up

829
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:24,199
a little bit because prospect areas in
the end of of the story okay

830
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:28,460
the first is just to review the bidding

831
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,979
when we think

832
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:31,219
about

833
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:32,570
judgment and decision making

834
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:38,109
we usually make all this the assumption
that decision makers are rational

835
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:39,760
in that they want out

836
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,379
optimize values or optimize of
optimizing tool

837
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:47,650
even if they haven't taken a nap
econnect an economic scores

838
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,470
even if they haven't taken a course in
probability and statistics yet that

839
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:56,820
somehow decisionmakers intuitively
understand alm believed that the

840
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,149
principles of statistic

841
00:37:58,149 --> 00:38:01,469
and the intuitively understand that the
principles of logic

842
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:04,099
and apply them as best they can

843
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:06,890
the kinds of facts that i've talked
about today

844
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,050
at last time

845
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:11,459
show us that these are some shins are
not

846
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:12,399
valid

847
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:13,739
so now the question is

848
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:15,799
what do we make of this

849
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:17,830
some psychologists have concluded

850
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,999
that people are j-list

851
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:22,079
irrational

852
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,170
on

853
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,650
who called this the people are stupid

854
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,050
school of psychology and there are
psychologists around to really do

855
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:33,689
believe the people are fundamentally
stupid

856
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:34,949
are dead people

857
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:38,099
don't know anything about probabilities
they don't know what's in their best

858
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:41,539
interest i don't know how they don't
distinguish between gains losses

859
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:43,459
they just do all these things on

860
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:46,039
if you read in the psychological
literature

861
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:48,020
on you'll see that

862
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,150
directors fund

863
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,940
talk about

864
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,329
will emphasize that people don't think
logically

865
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:56,839
or frankly that people don't think too
hard about everything

866
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:01,879
that people mostly or wander around
behaving automatically barbie hated on

867
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:03,289
automatic pilot

868
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:06,219
on you go down the you go down the
street

869
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,229
friend comes up and says

870
00:39:07,229 --> 00:39:09,470
hi john what are you doing what you're
saying

871
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,929
are doing fine thanks you could be dying

872
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:15,999
danielle still say i'm doing fine thanks

873
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:20,829
because that's carlos habitual thing to
do it all think about it too much

874
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:22,020
and also

875
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,410
that or one apart of human irrationality
comes for the fact

876
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:30,020
that we let our emotions on our motives
are feelings on our desires yet in the

877
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,809
way of our thinking okay

878
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:35,789
freud's idea about human irrationality

879
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:39,739
that call it wasn't so much the people
were stupid and i can say that i can

880
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:40,959
sense

881
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:47,009
of onboard our cognitions were dominated
by your feelings and our desires

882
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,879
so there is this general

883
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:50,460
conclusion

884
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,849
that sounds like religious all mukul
what want to draw

885
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:58,680
from evidence all of the sort that i
just presented onto you

886
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,939
that people are fundamentally irrational

887
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:04,229
they don't care if they don't think too
hard about anything and when they do

888
00:40:04,229 --> 00:40:06,919
think you are they don't think we write

889
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:07,849
all along

890
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:11,409
that people are mostly behaving out of
habit

891
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:16,139
and that people really don't aren't too
aware alvo of what they're doing all it

892
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:17,149
neither

893
00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:21,319
on that is a trend that you can see you
know

894
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,719
but in some quarters of psychology

895
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:27,199
there is another approach however

896
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,939
and this is a approach that was
pioneered by herbert simon who is one of

897
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:36,219
the first psychologist to win the nobel
prize operetta nomic finance

898
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:41,359
of sometime ago a long time ago and that
is an approach that's total beds bounded

899
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,279
rationality

900
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:47,729
signed then argued that despite the
evidence for judgment for judgment

901
00:40:47,729 --> 00:40:48,749
interest x

902
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:53,509
despite the fact that we don't have a
grice based on proper set principles

903
00:40:53,509 --> 00:40:56,929
despite the fact that we show framing
affects it and and in judgment and

904
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:59,210
decision making still

905
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,200
people arbor

906
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,609
fundamentally irrational

907
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:06,009
and it's a big book

908
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:08,020
rationality is constrained

909
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,619
by to different kinds of boundaries

910
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:14,059
first is

911
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:16,150
in the real world

912
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:21,339
most problems offer although presented
to us in the real world are ill-defined

913
00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:22,579
problems

914
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:23,759
that is

915
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:25,389
most decisions

916
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:26,270
occur

917
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,650
under conditions of uncertainty

918
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,449
where problems are not well defined

919
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:35,979
the information we need to solve
problems what all is off

920
00:41:35,979 --> 00:41:39,420
may be available but it's not economical
to get at it

921
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,280
all or the arc

922
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,829
beyond judgment procedure that we need
to apply

923
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:46,900
may be available but it's on economical
to get to it

924
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,680
one way or another

925
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,710
these are the kinds of circumstances

926
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,269
they create judgment under uncertainty

927
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:58,429
and when judgment is made under
conditions of uncertainty

928
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:01,080
that's abound that sorry are constrained

929
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,019
on human rationality but the other point

930
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:09,259
that signing made doesn't have to do
with the description of the world

931
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:11,109
outside the individual

932
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:12,640
world of uncertainty

933
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,359
but rather

934
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,799
a description of what goes on inside the
head of the individual

935
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:20,639
and simon simply pointed out

936
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:25,499
the human capacity for information
processing is limited

937
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:27,589
in daud george miller's terms

938
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:32,450
the magical number seven plus or minus
two there's a reason telephone numbers

939
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,209
are limited to seven digits

940
00:42:34,209 --> 00:42:38,149
that have never mind area codes our
country codes reason that they are

941
00:42:38,149 --> 00:42:40,579
called telephone codes are limited to
seven digit

942
00:42:40,579 --> 00:42:44,099
is that that's just about all they could
hold at our heads of whatever one

943
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:48,389
particular time seven items of
information

944
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:52,559
even of all the information that was
needed for to make a judgment were

945
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:53,810
available to the

946
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,549
on to the decision maker

947
00:42:55,549 --> 00:42:58,380
we don't have the processing capacity

948
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,119
to be able to

949
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,630
to pay attention

950
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,650
to all that information

951
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,319
moreover

952
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,349
we don't necessarily have

953
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:10,910
human information processing capacity to
perform

954
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,340
what might be very

955
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:17,760
are complicated computations
calculations on those kinds of uh...

956
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,979
things

957
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:20,029
all

958
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:21,130
so i would argue

959
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,579
that human beings were irrational

960
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:25,249
within limits

961
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:26,530
limits that are set

962
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,100
both by the nature although uncertainty
in the world

963
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,160
and also by

964
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,830
limitations on information from a
processing plant has to be

965
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,510
the in the in the human mind

966
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,709
instead of

967
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:42,050
maximizing outcomes therefore

968
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,820
simon argued in fact

969
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,190
button people make

970
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:46,699
decisions

971
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:49,159
either people or organizations

972
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:53,370
they do so not on the basis of
optimizing outcomes

973
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,330
but rather

974
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,549
what he called satisfy sing

975
00:43:57,549 --> 00:43:59,940
remember rational choice theory says

976
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:05,739
that a rational decision maker or try to
maximize games and minimize losses

977
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:10,769
and simon says if you look at what
people do either individually or in

978
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:12,469
organizations they don't do this

979
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:13,630
rather what they do

980
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:17,549
is to engage in what he called satisfy
sick

981
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:18,599
uh...

982
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:20,989
and within satisfy seem what you do

983
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:27,989
it is you identified all the outcomes of
a choice that are satisfactory

984
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,199
or identified the outcomes that are
satisfactory

985
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:34,389
and then you choose between them

986
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:37,659
you could choose between the randomly if
you will

987
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:39,500
org you can choose between them

988
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,869
based on some of their own

989
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:46,669
and some other although the principal
all barry schwartz who is a psychologist

990
00:44:46,669 --> 00:44:49,640
who studies judgment decision making
says

991
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,019
or what is called broke radical
reformation of the college admissions

992
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:55,269
process is that

993
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:59,049
rather than trying to make really
fine-grained

994
00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:03,969
necessarily fallible distinctions among
all the highly qualified applicants

995
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:06,499
for a propeller blade to a particular
school

996
00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:08,209
what admissions officer should do

997
00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:13,449
is simply identify of pool of applicants
who would be okay

998
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:16,189
and then choose randomly

999
00:45:16,189 --> 00:45:18,739
you make everybody's

1000
00:45:18,739 --> 00:45:22,860
a lot nusier then rather think all
here's a story with

1001
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:28,090
six eighty jr s_a_t_s and out of three
point five g_p_a_

1002
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:31,399
and here's another person with a six
hundred eighty two

1003
00:45:31,399 --> 00:45:31,949
s_a_t_

1004
00:45:31,949 --> 00:45:35,799
and a three point forty p avoid just
don't know how much wars and wanted to

1005
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:36,589
let go

1006
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:37,969
in st

1007
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,529
bulb on the same pool

1008
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:41,319
pick one

1009
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:46,649
the other one gets to go to u_c_l_a_ or
something like that

1010
00:45:46,649 --> 00:45:51,179
double bs perfectly satisfactory outcome
either way you get up dot bunch of well

1011
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:53,279
qualified students

1012
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:58,319
the public health example the disease
problem public-health officer might say

1013
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,559
program a m program be their precisely
equivalent

1014
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:02,430
okay

1015
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:06,069
but program as the one that the voters
are going to like

1016
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:09,729
they'll kill me they won't reelect me if
i'd choose program be an everybody's

1017
00:46:09,729 --> 00:46:11,689
laws

1018
00:46:11,689 --> 00:46:12,880
perfectly rational way

1019
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,890
to make a decision

1020
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:15,769
alm

1021
00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:16,789
and nam

1022
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:18,290
on in affirmative action

1023
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:21,509
to take another example of
organizational decision making

1024
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:22,920
you might have

1025
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,880
all majority applicant and a minority
catholic and

1026
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,239
who are both

1027
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:28,049
perfectly

1028
00:46:28,049 --> 00:46:34,099
equally qualified for the job you could
only hire one of those you might say

1029
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:37,959
our organization values diver sity so
we're going to be in this instance we're

1030
00:46:37,959 --> 00:46:42,180
going to choose the minority applicant
over the over the majority applicant

1031
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,249
because we want to have a more diverse
workforce the two are

1032
00:46:46,249 --> 00:46:48,619
equal in their croat in their i'd

1033
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:53,329
the book either one would be
satisfactory employees

1034
00:46:53,329 --> 00:46:55,649
choose among the satisfactory outcomes

1035
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:57,949
based on another principles

1036
00:46:57,949 --> 00:46:59,680
so there are lots of ways

1037
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,410
to satisfies

1038
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,739
and started slicing simon points out

1039
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,729
perfectly rational way

1040
00:47:06,729 --> 00:47:08,000
to operate

1041
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,259
under conditions of

1042
00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:13,000
judgment under uncertainty

1043
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,300
and

1044
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:17,109
a limited information processing
capacity

1045
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:18,880
so in fact

1046
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,150
bounded rationality is

1047
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,539
are rational approach

1048
00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:25,390
although due to problem solving

1049
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:29,390
on grid giga rennes r_ a british opened
sorry german although psychologist has

1050
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:30,420
made this point

1051
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,689
if that's what

1052
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:33,569
judgment he respects mei

1053
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:35,720
in principle violate

1054
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,150
or rational

1055
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,590
all of norms for a logic

1056
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,480
but if you think about it for a second

1057
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,820
judgment heuristics are often the best
approach toward two-way radio tual

1058
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,219
problem either because the problem is
home

1059
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:51,779
uh... you'll defined as opposed to be
well-defined

1060
00:47:51,779 --> 00:47:52,889
or because

1061
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:56,319
the algorithm that you'd used to do is
to solve the problem

1062
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,340
is somehow on economical

1063
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,869
ought to apply

1064
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:02,269
yet around serb points out

1065
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:04,909
yes it's rational to optimize

1066
00:48:04,909 --> 00:48:07,390
but it's also a rational to would jack
dot org

1067
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,679
through due to a dejected khatami's

1068
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,130
into human decision making

1069
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:15,689
as long as you're willing to pay the
price for ever

1070
00:48:15,689 --> 00:48:18,349
okay

1071
00:48:18,349 --> 00:48:19,130
heuristics

1072
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,729
inject great economies in the human
decision making

1073
00:48:21,729 --> 00:48:24,900
if you are not willing to pay the price
for an error

1074
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,289
then you better

1075
00:48:26,289 --> 00:48:27,480
find an algorithm

1076
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,920
someplace but most of time

1077
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,759
mistakes don't cost us that much

1078
00:48:32,759 --> 00:48:35,660
most of the time when we use these broad
kinds of decision

1079
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,880
doesn't cost us that much

1080
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,660
if i say to you what's the percentage of
countries all of them u_n_ members were

1081
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:45,900
perfect dog content developer cut some
people say ten percent what do you say

1082
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:52,009
and you say twenty five percent on the
proper answer is forty five percent

1083
00:48:52,009 --> 00:48:54,390
terrors

1084
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,519
did make that

1085
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:57,929
allowed on the day that you could make
that the risk

1086
00:48:57,929 --> 00:48:59,990
so what you can do however

1087
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,489
is you can reduce

1088
00:49:01,489 --> 00:49:02,879
the likelihood

1089
00:49:02,879 --> 00:49:07,439
that reliance on judgment teristics will
lead to wearers by giving by allowing

1090
00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:09,759
people to appreciate eight

1091
00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:13,399
how they actually makes decisions

1092
00:49:13,399 --> 00:49:15,499
using principles like these

1093
00:49:15,499 --> 00:49:16,430
and b

1094
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:22,420
what some of the liabilities or attached
to those modes of decision making are

1095
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:27,310
rational decision maker is not somebody
is not just somebody who applies the

1096
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,919
principles of aristide gilliam logic

1097
00:49:29,919 --> 00:49:35,509
are rational decision maker is this it
is a decision maker who will gets

1098
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:40,399
satisfactory outcomes unit economical
way who wonders stands how he or she

1099
00:49:40,399 --> 00:49:45,059
makes decisions and understands what the
costs and benefits or

1100
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:48,729
and that's what you now or

1101
00:49:48,729 --> 00:49:52,660
next time will begin our discussion of
personality and social psychology
