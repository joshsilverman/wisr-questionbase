87
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,549
slots left

90
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,129
waitlisted in order for you to move into
the course okay

91
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,870
all got usually happens

92
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,529
we added three new sections of there are
those of the course just last week

93
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:17,109
those are pretty vacant

94
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:21,449
if you can move into sections one twenty
seven one twenty five one twenty six two

95
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,940
one twenty seven

96
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,930
which meet monday or tuesday

97
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,979
all your chances of getting into the
class are very very very qualified

98
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,590
all priorities demand a freshman
sophomores

99
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,240
the reason for that is this is all this
course is a prerequisite for the

100
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,379
psychology major

101
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:40,370
by the time the finished yourself or
your euphoria declared a major in

102
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,250
something unless you don't need this
particular version of psych one all so

103
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,240
much

104
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,619
but to all

105
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:52,449
will move people automatically off the
waitlist or into the chorus as seats

106
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:53,740
open up

107
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,000
art in accordance with their ranking on
the waitlist for discussion section

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,489
what matters is where your waitlisted

109
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:03,659
for the discussion section up for the
course a whole

110
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,669
with priority given to freshman
sophomores

111
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:10,880
so what you should do beginning next
week is attend the discussion section

112
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,159
for which your waitlisted

113
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:13,919
okay

114
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,649
if you don't attend the discussion
section for witcher waitlisted

115
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:21,159
there is some risk that we will think
you're just not interested in the course

116
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:22,229
and will drop you

117
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,430
to make room for somebody who is so
beginning next week

118
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,440
go to the discussion section that your
enrolled in

119
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,430
where your waitlisted for we'll see what
we can do for you

120
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,349
if for some reason you can't attend
discussion section next week

121
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:40,829
get in talked at in contact with your g
s_r_i_ will post those names to the

122
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:41,750
website

123
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,250
or probably waiter of later today

124
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,669
okay so that should be

125
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:47,569
fairly clear

126
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:52,129
i mentioned before there is a
note-taking service here are at the

127
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:54,139
r_u_c_ of the berkeley

128
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,849
all-black lightning lecture notes this
is the only authorized note-taking

129
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,430
service on campus

130
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,879
or this course dean one of the larger
courses on campus has a black lightning

131
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,990
note taker

132
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,540
all of these notes are not a substitute
for your own notes

133
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,940
educationally speaking in terms of how
people learn

134
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,040
there is absolutely no substitute for
having your own notes to put your own

135
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,840
spin

136
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,189
your own organization on things

137
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,229
however if you have to miss a lecture

138
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:24,030
or you want another perspective on what
went on to lecture

139
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,069
the black-white name lecture notes are
can be very all valuable

140
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:31,069
i think they cost thirty nine box for
the semester

141
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:32,739
which is a pretty good deal

142
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:35,430
all and you can get more information
about those

143
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,229
are at that

144
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:39,220
the that don't you worry at all

145
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:45,259
all of the l allen at secure so it's
uh... dot com

146
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:49,319
what a what about examinations we've got
three exams and of course two midterms

147
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,629
and a final

148
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:53,939
the two midterms are going to be
administered in classes one early

149
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:56,979
october there's one in mid november

150
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,279
and then there's a final examination

151
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,580
the midterm exams are non cumulative
exams

152
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,510
first midterm covers everything
beginning today going right up to the

153
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,570
first midterm second midterm covers
everything since the first midterm right

154
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,770
up to the second midterm and then the
final exam

155
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,460
well cat will have undocumented portion

156
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,240
that covers everything since the second
midterm

157
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,139
and then if you want a portion of covers
the entire class

158
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,240
educationally one test is not

159
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,860
a good idea who want to give you a
chance to go back over the entire

160
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,539
material

161
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:31,560
ought to take a test on from the second
time

162
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,449
it turns out

163
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,069
that you learned things better

164
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:39,099
the final exam is scheduled for on on
december thirteenth

165
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:42,259
eight oh eight to eleven o'clock a
morning we don't know where yet

166
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,359
but it'll probably be some jimmy and
some gymnasium

167
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:51,009
all the exams and of course are multiple
choice computer scored exams

168
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:55,270
that's to make sure that the scores but
that is the exams are scored reliably

169
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,829
and fairly of for everyone

170
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:02,459
despite being mortal traits computer
score they emphasize basic concepts and

171
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:03,539
principles

172
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,340
they don't as fuel for of god

173
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,269
datagrid about names and dates

174
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:12,539
while we're not told particularly
interested in that

175
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,349
and the exams cover

176
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:19,080
the readings and the lectures with
roughly equal emphasis i could not be in

177
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,949
the short time that's available to
ordered to leave basically thirty

178
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:23,729
lectures

179
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:26,129
cover all the material it's in a text
book

180
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:30,029
who do your textbook is the best
introductory psychology textbook written

181
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:34,119
over a hundred years it doesn't
wonderful job all-volunteer

182
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:36,409
of covering all of the territory

183
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,870
and we hope you'll do well but they will
hold you responsible for the material

184
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,680
it's in that class it in that book as
well

185
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,320
uh... important policy

186
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,300
there were no make-up exams and of
course

187
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,310
okay so we expect you to take the exams
when they're being administered

188
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,620
if there's some kind of family emergency
you're kind of stock in my lawyer

189
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,399
something that your grandmother's
funeral

190
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,860
will deal with that

191
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,390
but outside of that

192
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,220
you we expect you to be here

193
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,999
four all for the exams

194
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:08,920
their arch hello there aren't any
make-ups

195
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,870
yes

196
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,180
wells we want to

197
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,090
or another component to all of the
course is what's known as the research

198
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,780
participation program

199
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,089
over going to talk a little bit more
about this on wednesday

200
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,470
but for now

201
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,759
all by virtue of the parvin policy

202
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,929
the introductory in mid level survey
courses inordinate psychology department

203
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,230
all have associated with them

204
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,880
and research participation of all the
requirement

205
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,280
the reason for that is pretty simple

206
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,149
on psychology as a science

207
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,920
so laboratory science

208
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,750
if you were taking a course in physics
or chemistry or biology there would be a

209
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,089
laboratory section attached to that
course

210
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:50,140
that would give you a chance to roll
bulls down incline

211
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,120
blow something up by mixing chemicals

212
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,660
walls dissect of salamander or something
like that

213
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,050
we can't do that

214
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,600
here we can't give ear a little pigeon
or white rat to play with we can't have

215
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,110
your running around

216
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,380
administering

217
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,410
questionnaires to all your own hold all
your role of the door mates

218
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,899
so they've research participation
program

219
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,590
is designed to allow you to see

220
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,360
how psychological sciences darden

221
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,220
how data is collected how experiments
are conducted in all of that

222
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,760
at the same time

223
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,360
alba by participating in our ongoing
research projects

224
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,030
uh... in though

225
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,989
or the debtor while being conducted by

226
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:31,700
faculty and graduate students in the
department

227
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,790
in this course all the requirement is
five hours of research purchase of

228
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,260
haitian

229
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:42,650
or spread out over the course of the
semester it's not a very onerous our

230
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,850
requirement most of the experiments

231
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,070
all of that dot

232
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,060
all that door

233
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,290
part of the research purchase vision
program are

234
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,339
pretty interesting kinds of things to do

235
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:56,149
some of them are as straightforward as
completing some survey questionnaires

236
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:59,899
orders involve you talk to the ditch
were involved in doing

237
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,300
or actual experiments with

238
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,620
computers with other other and other
kinds of machines in uh... in the

239
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,090
laboratory

240
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,589
and that was

241
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:08,660
do you

242
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,500
do this

243
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,360
is by signing up

244
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,190
on you get your credits through the

useful

293
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,029
it has little quizzes little exercises
fill-in the blank kinds of things

the study guide is recommended but it is
very highly recommended itself very very

299
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,119
very good

all resource

301
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,320
although you first thing we want you to
get ignored all were called snaps

302
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,690
the norton psychology labs

303
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,869
this is basically a password

304
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:02,750
to an online long ordered a set of
laboratory exercises

305
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,269
you will do a eight of these in the
course of the or

306
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:07,100
of the so

307
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,389
uh... course this semester

308
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:12,489
alone there more to they're more details
about that

309
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:14,420
in the home

310
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,479
in the syllabus

311
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,990
but basically or when you buy this thing

312
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,980
you get the or password

313
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,739
that allows you to register

314

for the door and psychology labs

315
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,440
where they called the snaps

316
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,520
well these labs word actually developed
by a group of dutch researchers

317
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,970
anzac sues the doctor abbreviation for

318
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,440
psychology ones

319
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,420
don't ask me i'm not dodge right but
that's basically what it means

320
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,850
well but in any event

321
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,850
are all three of these items the

all previous exams in this class

455
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,780
to get some sense of the kinds of
questions layouts

456
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,350
with answers

457
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:20,900
mostly

458
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,830
the right answers

459
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,679
while sometimes you know there's a slip
and i just didn't catch it

460
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,360
all but i think the mostly the you know
the correct answers

461
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,050
on here's a link to the court's webcast

462
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:36,490
here's a link to the or p_p_ program
website there is a link to the zaps

463
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,130
website

464
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,790
here's a link to the point and
overbooked

465
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,710
on here's a link for section info within
a day or so

466
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,929
dawn the section info will be complete

467
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:51,120
and we'll have information about or
which geo saris or working with which

468
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,000
uh...

469
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,780
uh... which sections

470
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,780
okay how we calculate grades

471
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,280
there are three hundred and forty points
available all for this course

472
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,809
the midterms are worth fifty points each
so there is a hundred points right there

473
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:05,880
final exam is worth a hundred points

474
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,669
all of section

475
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:11,520
our discussion sections worth a hundred
points discussion sections are a scarce

476
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,369
resource

477
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:14,760
so they're valuable

478
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,370
on

479
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,610
both hundred points are going to be
determined

480
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:23,360
but in large part by attendance and
participation on that sixty points for

481
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:23,919
section

482
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,110
and then completion of the zaps
exercises is going toward give you

483
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:32,220
another forty points that's aids affects
your sizes in the forty points five

484
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,970
points for zaps exercise and then forty
more points

485
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,320
for your five or research of purchase of
haitian

486
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,670
or credits

487
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,710
here are the grading standards for the
class

488
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,400
traditional industry standard

489
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,779
if you accumulate at least ninety
percent of available points

490
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:51,740
you're guaranteed sometime today

491
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,450
accumulate at least eighty percent
guaranteed some kind of the

492
00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:00,400
fifty one percent or more guarantees you
some kind of c

493
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,649
if you're breathing

494
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:07,630
you can accumulate fifty one percent or
more of these points

495
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,450
pretty much you've got to breathe
regularly project

496
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,340
i do that deliberately i don't want
there to be any pressure on people are

497
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,260
ordained by going to get a deal we're
going to get enough

498
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,000
almost certainly not you really have to
screw up with me

499
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,790
to get but the wrath

500
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,930
okay

501
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,540
bought you know if you get in the
psychology to find out was boring

502
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,850
origins as too complicated or whatever

503
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,390
okay

504
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,330
the worse it's going to happen to you
with some kind of c

505
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:36,940
alm

506
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,110
but to all of these already as i say
industry standard grading standards

507
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:45,250
what i do want to go to set the final
distribution of grades

508
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,279
i'd check my distribution of grades

509
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,519
i guess distribution of grades in all
other introductory courses in the

510
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,369
biological and social sciences and i
make sure that my distribution matches

511
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,140
that

512
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,610
so we all do a look

513
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,059
the class will do as well in this class

514
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:02,539
as classes do

515
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:07,030
in general on average by green standards
are writer more liberal

516
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,229
nor more strict

517
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:09,059
then they are

518
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,779
at the rest of uh... address the campus

519
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:15,450
okay

520
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,580
anne we're going to talk a little bit
about what psychology is all about the

521
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:25,580
for now any questions about the
organization and format of the course

522
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,309
disaster exercises are graded on
completion

523
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:36,529
i get up i gather notified by saps when
you've completed your zaps

524
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:37,220
okay

525
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,570
there are deadlines

526
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,129
for each of these okay

527
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:41,059
that it takes

528
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:44,710
a couple of days for the feedback to get
the new take takes me a couple of days

529
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,029
to get buffing up on the grade book

530
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:50,420
but basically it's although it
automatically

531
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,669
and it's on

532
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:52,470
or not

533
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,200
you completed

534
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,420
if you completed you get flight bookings
if you don't

535
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,580
yeah i don't

536
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,550
well that is the curve ok we'd you're
just accumulating points

537
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,940
so there's fifty points for every
midterm for each of the midterms hundred

538
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,310
points for the fault them for the for
the final

539
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,909
we don't set the curb until the very end

540
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:17,960
okay

541
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,309
all but as i say

542
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:23,330
if you accumulate ninety ninety percent
point you are guaranteed some kind of a

543
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,909
no matter what the curve is

544
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:27,769
loosen the curve

545
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:30,120
but i will never tight-knit

546
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,650
ninety percent guarantees sometime today

547
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,210
eighty-percent guarantee some kind of
the

548
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:41,150
question back here

549
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:45,250
but if there's little reason for you not
to be a discussion section talk to your

550
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,679
geoscience where you can work it out

551
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,400
now that but there's no make up for
labor day pick

552
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,620
there's no discussion section on labor
day

553
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,110
yell and you'll notice that the very end
the last day classes on monday

554
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,810
okay so that's not an issue

555
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,990
gotten like thanksgiving

556
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,930
going home for thanksgiving if your
discussion sections on thursday or

557
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,710
friday

558
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:16,450
because that's where your geoscience yes

559
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,880
does that sex is sizes are for this
class okay

560
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,610
they are not experiments in the sense
that you're not creating data for

561
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,059
science these are

562
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:28,560
laboratory demonstrations

563
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,050
and that's what just what should have a
lot of exposure to various kinds of

564
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,289
things in the class

565
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:35,470
the or p_p_ is one way to do it

566
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,980
zaps is another way to do it

567
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,190
but they are

568
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,480
independent of each other

569
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,480
one more question ya

570
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:56,400
i'll be using the seventh edition of the
leibman until there's an a tradition

571
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,530
arm extremely loyal

572
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,690
to why will professor

573
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:06,920
the passwords will be good for ever as
far as i can tell

574
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,040
anything else yes

575
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,220
my office hours they were on the first
flight monday and wednesday eleven to

576
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,050
twelve

577
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,480
but not today

578
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,030
okay i've got a stud i thought that i
have to do at eleven o'clock alone today

579
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,160
also referral forbidden by appointment

580
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,440
furthermore i try to get here at least
ten minutes before class

581
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,030
i try to stay

582
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,730
until the last of u leaves after class

583
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,630
so if you have any difficulties doll
making office hours

584
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:36,590
nobody shows up for office hours because

585
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,100
there never convenient

586
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,440
for most people

587
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,350
just send me an email we can make an
appointment we could probably do

588
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,340
whatever we need to be

589
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,340
whatever transact whatever business we
need to transact

590
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,429
over email

591
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:55,140
anything else about the organization for
men of the course yes

592
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,990
the alternative test if you're not a
good all the pens

593
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,880
if you turn eighteen

594
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,460
by the end of september you got plenty
of time to do our p p

595
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,480
if you turn eighteen on october first or
after

596
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,410
probably not

597
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:14,440
also on there's an author of a cited
involves doing some in some additional

598
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,920
zaps exercises

599
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,050
so if you're under eighteen

600
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,180
don't worry about it

601
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:27,180
we've got you covered

602
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,549
no there's no mechanism for that

603
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:35,000
that they'll all be peace dot bill to do
that it's is itself zero-based budget

604
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,100
uh... if you will

605
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:44,100
or anything else about the organization
for men of the course

606
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,480
mole know they're just kill your back

607
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,040
so now you have to bring the textbook to
class i don't like to read to you from a

608
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,310
textbook or anything like that

609
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,230
professor do that once

610
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,920
but the

611
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,289
that so much for a soul

612
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,170
i would just leave them in your

613
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,300
we got stuff in your rome

614
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,710
in your room once in awhile

615
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,639
you're

616
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:08,690
all

617
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:12,710
g_s_ all you might ask you to bring the
text of discussion section but

618
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,200
not very often

619
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:21,200
something back here

620
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:26,600
that these guys webs whenever right
update something to be space website i'd

621
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,160
try to remember to send an email
announcement to everybody

622
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,159
but the discussion board

623
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:36,390
that's not something that you get a
naturally in email announcement of that

624
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,990
something you just gotta get my habit of
checking

625
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:39,690
okay

626
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,590
if you post a questionnaire well check
for the response

627
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,169
alm

628
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:47,320
but think when you start poking around
on the these days website you're going

629
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,620
to find it's a pretty damn good website

630
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,960
it's got a lot of resources on it i
spent a lot of time on it

631
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,720
also i think there is feedback

632
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,600
giving feedback

633
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,900
mostly positive

634
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,070
anything else

635
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,710
yes

636
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:11,710
rests right here in the

637
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,799
work within two if you have a discussion
and you want to switch discussion times

638
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:24,620
we could almost certainly do that
informally

639
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,820
okay so deal with your geoscience out
that you might be able to move into one

640
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,510
of his or her other discussion sections
that the that's the easiest thing to do

641
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,820
or swap with somebody else we can
arrange that too

642
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,470
whatever you do

643
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,350
unless you're going to that are sections
one twenty five one twenty six two one

644
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,450
twenty seven

645
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,280
do not to walk

646
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,620
your discussion section because what
will happen is telebrands will kick out

647
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,020
of the class and put in the bottom of
the wedding list

648
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,169
so we'll do all of that informally

649
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:54,700
beginning next week

650
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,830
anything else

651
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,120
haven't left anything out

652
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,520
where or

653
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,419
no no extra credit opportunities

654
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:05,990
alm

655
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,840
and the reason for that is it's just not
fair

656
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,250
some of you have a lot of time on your
hands

657
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,970
or others of you have fav

658
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,590
five-person families in your holding
down three jobs at extra credits just

659
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,280
not fair

660
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,880
no starbucks for me

661
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,540
i don't drink coffee actually

662
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:33,540
although you'll find that i dressed like
a blockbuster clerk i don't recall

663
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:41,320
anything else

664
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,170
all right so what are we going to be
doing this course

665
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,760
william james who wrote the best
psychology textbook

666
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,390
besides glickman

667
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,639
all

668
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:56,120
great american philosopher a pioneering
american our psychologist

669
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,870
define psychology as the science of
mental life

670
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,240
the whole point of psychology

671
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,330
is to describe the nature and function

672
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,830
of mental structures and processes the
mental structures and prophecies

673
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,240
that all underlying

674
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,649
human experience

675
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:14,940
thought and action psychology

676
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,500
it's a science of mental life who tries
to understand

677
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,460
hollow the mind works

678
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,010
what we mean barry mental life

679
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,260
no better description of what the mind
does

680
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,940
exists i think than the one who offered
by

681
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,480
german philosopher immanuel kant more
than

682
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,830
two hundred years ago

683
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,350
so there are three things that the mine
does

684
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:39,670
it knows things it feels things

685
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,570
and it does there is things

686
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:46,049
there are three absolutely irreducible
faculties of mine

687
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:46,809
knowledge

688
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:49,840
feeling and desire

689
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,679
great twentieth-century psychologist
ernest hogar jack hillberg

690
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,070
put another way you talk about when he
called the trilogy of mine

691
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,650
art of cognition

692
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,769
having to do with

693
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:03,870
knowing things and believing things

694
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,010
the motion

695
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,180
had to do with feelings affects

696
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,290
moods

697
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,779
and meditation

698
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:12,609
having to do with

699
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:13,640
needs and goals

700
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,850
roles and purposes

701
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:19,430
drives desires all of that kind of stuff

702
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,100
so what

703
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,780
psychology tries to understand is

704
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,830
how we engage in these kinds of mental
activities

705
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,990
highwaymen things

706
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,639
where feelings come from what's the
nature of notification

707
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:33,880
and on and so on

708
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,520
sol the scope of psychology is very
broad

709
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,150
and so is the scope of the scores

710
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,220
we will focus mostly on basic mental
processes

711
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,840
trying to figure out how the mind works

712
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,950
and in this course

713
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,700
because we don't have a lot

714
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,360
a limited amount of time

715
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,160
we're going to focus mostly on basic
cognitive processes

716
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,190
how we

717
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:59,940
gat knowledge and acquire knowledge andy
use knowledge

718
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,140
in addition the psychology of the
dissident things like

719
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,920
widow mine comes from

720
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,990
so we're going to be talking about the
bella dental psychology for a little

721
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,700
while

722
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:14,429
how mind all rose through biological
evolution howell mind changes

723
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:18,679
the development of the individual

724
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,290
for all one of the courts will be
talking about mind in general

725
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:27,469
how perception memory and thinking and
reasoning work

726
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,069
integral

727
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:33,659
but psychology is also interested in
individual differences in how each

728
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:34,299
individual

729
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:40,149
is unique with respect to or the
organization of his or her mental life

730
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:42,109
we're all a somewhat different police

731
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:42,960
somewhat different

732
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,120
in someone different desire somewhat
different reactions to what goes on

733
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,430
around is these individual differences
in mental life

734
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:54,789
are very important aspect of what
psychology is all about

735
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:56,399
towards the end of the semester

736
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,919
we'll talk about

737
00:34:57,919 --> 00:35:01,560
pathology of mental life so-called
psychopathology

738
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:07,379
what the various disorders of mental of
mine look like schizophrenic ah...

739
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:11,849
don't depression and anxiety disorders
whatever of those various mental

740
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:13,119
illnesses are

741
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,380
and then finally

742
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,840
in addition to being a basic science

743
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,890
psychology is an applied science

744
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,889
we're not just interested in how the
mind works in the abstract

745
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:27,940
psychologists are interested in taking
what we know about how the mind works

746
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,829
and applying this knowledge

747
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:32,749
in various domains to education

748
00:35:32,749 --> 00:35:34,390
to help the

749
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,079
process of teaching and learning

750
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,720
be as good as it can be

751
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,140
in psychotherapy

752
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,170
for the prevention and treatment

753
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,449
on various forms of mental illness

754
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:44,649
in the workplace

755
00:35:44,649 --> 00:35:50,140
to help managers be more effective to
help workers before productive

756
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,369
psychology as the science of mental life

757
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:54,349
is both basic science

758
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:55,860
the tries to understand

759
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,799
how the mind works

760
00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:00,410
and applied science that seeks to

761
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,640
make that knowledge useful

762
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,679
in kal in various in various ways

763
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:11,119
so they try to fight club what kind of
sciences psychology

764
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,250
psychology is first and foremost

765
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,450
what we call a behavioral science

766
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:19,520
there were a number of these behavioral
sciences like anthropology of economics

767
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,329
and political science and sociology

768
00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:23,780
on each of which

769
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,810
has a

770
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,130
somewhat different approach

771
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,369
to understanding the behavior of the in
the park

772
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:31,449
the individual organism

773
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:35,110
whether that's a human organism or an
animal organism

774
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,780
acid as some of the individual interacts
with or other individuals

775
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,440
and with

776
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,339
the altman and with the surrounding

777
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:44,429
environment

778
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:47,579
all the behavioral sciences are
interested in that

779
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,720
they each of these behavioral sciences

780
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,010
takes a somewhat different approach

781
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,339
to understanding behavior

782
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:57,929
and in psychology what work particularly
interested in is

783
00:36:57,929 --> 00:37:03,380
the mental process these that our dept
lead people to behave the way

784
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,469
they do

785
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:07,459
the basic

786
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:09,680
rationale for psychology is a science

787
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,449
is to be found in of philosophical
doctrines known as mental ism

788
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:17,430
or sometimes known as a mental causation

789
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,520
which stated formally

790
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,299
basically says that mental states are to
action as cause to affect

791
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:26,320
that is

792
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,519
member of the individuals mental states

793
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,259
cause him or her

794
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:33,599
do the things that he or she does

795
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,910
the cause ok d you behave the way you do

796
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,559
because you think

797
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,969
or feel or designer

798
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,820
the of the things uh... that though

799
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,740
that you do

800
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,559
so for example

801
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:48,950
consider all

802
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,990
fairly dramatic example behavior

803
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,589
a person commits suicide

804
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:56,779
questions why did somebody do that

805
00:37:56,779 --> 00:38:00,740
why did he or she behave in that
particular way

806
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,370
psychological explanation

807
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:07,719
always explains behavior in terms all of
the individuals mental states

808
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,849
so for example

809
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:12,160
we could get over any kind of
explanation for this behavior

810
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,289
in terms of what the individual norms

811
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:21,119
new or what the individual believes so
perhaps this person committed suicide

812
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,589
because he believed

813
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:25,609
he was all of no value

814
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:29,090
or we could give unemotional explanation

815
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,950
or that individuals' behavior

816
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,070
in terms of his or her

817
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,370
emotions

818
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:39,470
affects moods or feelings so perhaps a
person committed suicide

819
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,769
because he or she

820
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:43,119
depressed

821
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,900
feelings not knowing not believing of
feeling explaining behavior

822
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,180
or might give in motivational

823
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:51,559
explanation

824
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,360
for that individuals' behavior

825
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,309
in terms of his or her

826
00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:56,219
drives

827
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:56,799
needs

828
00:38:56,799 --> 00:38:59,749
goals for so long so that

829
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:04,179
the person committed sold suicide
because they no longer had the desire to

830
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:05,879
live

831
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:11,059
psychological explanations of behavior
are always in terms of knowledge

832
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:13,359
feeling or desire

833
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,560
always in terms

834
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,599
the individuals cognitive

835
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,390
emotional

836
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,399
motivational

837
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,749
states

838
00:39:21,749 --> 00:39:25,639
so when with try to think about

839
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:27,510
kind of science psychology is

840
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,989
you find out pretty quickly

841
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:32,130
that psychology is a social science

842
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:33,920
and the reason for that is

843
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,240
all behavioral sort of sciences try to
understand the behavior of the

844
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,939
individual

845
00:39:38,939 --> 00:39:40,839
but the individual

846
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:47,290
lives in a social environment we are
social beings we live in a world of

847
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:52,530
other people or with whom we interact we
cooperate we compete with these

848
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,090
individuals

849
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,059
so psychology as a social science

850
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:57,430
tries to understand

851
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,739
the relation between the individual

852
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:03,380
and these social world in which

853
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,930
he or she lives so you'll find
psychologist

854
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,780
looking at

855
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,729
various aspects of social interaction

856
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:13,609
how we interact with each other for
cooperation and competition

857
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:17,959
how we understandable other people or
how

858
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:22,609
groups and organizations influence the
behavior of the individual

859
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:27,079
personality and individual differences
also usually thought of as part of

860
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:29,459
psychology as his social science

861
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:32,210
for psychology of the social science

862
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,399
and it's also

863
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:36,159
okay biological science

864
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,150
just as psychology of the social science
because the individual

865
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,519
because humans or social

866
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,289
creatures

867
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:46,230
psychology is a biological science

868
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:51,549
because we understand that the brain
that is the physical bases of mine

869
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,469
and so

870
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:54,690
who want to stand out of mind works

871
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,560
probably auto understand a little bit

872
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,550
about how the brain works so are in this
course will do a little bit of neuro

873
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:05,880
anatomy little neurophysiology we'll
talk a little bit about how the nervous

874
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,170
system relates to all other bodily
systems like the endocrine system and

875
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,839
the uh... and the immune system

876
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:13,829
or

877
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:18,259
molecular and cellular biology as you'll
see is also relevant of all it's a

878
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:18,850
psychology

879
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,279
too bad acts

880
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:24,200
armed evolutionary biology also relevant
to psychology

881
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,410
but finally

882
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:30,050
or ecology which looks at the relation
between organisms in the environment

883
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,910
is also something that psychologist have
interest in

884
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:34,279
especially

885
00:41:34,279 --> 00:41:36,720
the relationship between the individual

886
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,310
and social

887
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:38,789
environment

888
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:41,299
so psychology of the social science

889
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,110
social biological science

890
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,910
in some sense it's also a physical
science

891
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,939
because the brain

892
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:51,839
is a physical chemical system it
operates on a core team to are basically

893
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,999
electrochemical

894
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:57,740
principles and one of the most important
new tools

895
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,140
for psychology

896
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,819
or a set of devices

897
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,670
devices that allow us to

898
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,170
wall

899
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,829
and various ways

900
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:08,230
damage the brain take pictures of the
brain

901
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,239
while people or engaged in

902
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,499
mental activities

903
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:15,660
so because though a brain is the
physical basis of mine

904
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,679
and the brains of electrochemical system

905
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:19,960
psychology also cones

906
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,359
to some extent has a

907
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:23,719
physical science

908
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:28,709
the fact that psychology can be thought
of as a biological maybe a physical

909
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:30,380
science in some respects

910
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,319
raises the question of reduction is a

911
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:36,160
or it's one of my favorite quotes by
from

912
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,499
ernest rutherford

913
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:40,519
of typical attitude on the part of
people like him

914
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:42,250
there's only one finance

915
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,579
that physics

916
00:42:43,579 --> 00:42:46,009
all the rest is stamp collecting

917
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:47,329
oh

918
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:51,089
never mind that brought the prince of
won the nobel prize in chemistry

919
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:52,780
he seems to have had some

920
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,520
self-paced

921
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,499
of there

922
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:59,259
there is a tendency among some
scientists to think that

923
00:42:59,259 --> 00:43:03,599
what if that if you really got a science
you want to be able to reduce the

924
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,910
principles of psychology two principles
of biology

925
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:11,760
and principles of biology intern two
principles of of physics

926
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,049
and one of the

927
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:16,899
underlying questions in psychology one
that you might grapple with in your

928
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:17,940
discussion sections

929
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,999
is wider or that can actually happen
loan or not

930
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,150
to what extent

931
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:27,239
can we reduce the principles of
psychology to the principles of

932
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:29,029
uh...

933
00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:32,630
particles operating in fields all twelve
forests

934
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,930
my own view is that that's

935
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:37,999
not the right way to do psychology

936
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:40,960
rather i'd prefer that you think of
their bane

937
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,609
different levels at which we can explain

938
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:47,059
various aspects of behavior

939
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:52,649
there is the psychological level of
explanation in terms of the individual

940
00:43:52,649 --> 00:43:58,189
underlying mental states cognitive
emotional and motivational states

941
00:43:58,189 --> 00:43:58,979
however

942
00:43:58,979 --> 00:44:04,200
you can also give a sociocultural
explanation of the havier

943
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,469
of the kind of favored by economists and
sociologists anthropologists

944
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:11,959
that explains behavior of the individual

945
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:16,259
in terms of socio cultural structures
and practices what's going on in the

946
00:44:16,259 --> 00:44:17,249
society

947
00:44:17,249 --> 00:44:20,689
that the persons a member of what's
going on in the culture that the person

948
00:44:20,689 --> 00:44:22,119
to member of

949
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:22,579
or

950
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:24,849
you can give an explanation

951
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:29,440
on biophysical terms in terms of things
like neuro transmitters

952
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,080
jeans and hormones these are all related
to each other in some ways

953
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,740
but what i want you to think of the view
i want you to think about in this class

954
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,109
is that you should these levels is a
legitimate explanation of behavior in

955
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:46,509
its own right

956
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:49,479
physical explanation or a biological
explanation behavior

957
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:50,939
is no better

958
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:53,400
that a psychological explanation of
behavior

959
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,380
it's just a different kind of
explanation psychologists explain

960
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:58,849
behavior

961
00:44:58,849 --> 00:44:59,849
in terms of

962
00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:02,069
the individuals

963
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:02,759
states

964
00:45:02,759 --> 00:45:06,470
all of that as i say you know others
sort of other sciences

965
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,809
might do it differently

966
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:11,299
so for example we could explain behavior
psychologically

967
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:14,269
in terms of the individuals not

968
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:16,999
feelings and desires

969
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:20,229
we could give of that explanation that
same behavior

970
00:45:20,229 --> 00:45:22,690
in terms of something socio-cultural

971
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:25,769
that he was in a group and as leader
told them to do it

972
00:45:25,769 --> 00:45:29,619
whether you're a japanese kinda qazi
pilot in world war two

973
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:33,380
or a member of the jonestown colt in
guyana

974
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:38,450
altered just though about just about
twenty years ago the explanation of both

975
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:38,849
suicides

976
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:43,100
is to be found in the cultural surround
of the individual

977
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,819
or you could give a biophysical
explanation

978
00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:49,809
bike so i think he well maybe there's
some genetic predisposition to suicide

979
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:52,669
and that accounts for why somebody dot

980
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:55,959
these different levels of exploitation

981
00:45:55,959 --> 00:45:56,750
all

982
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,090
of equal status

983
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:02,719
in psychology we favor the psychological
level of explanation

984
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,170
in terms of knowledge

985
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:07,390
desire

986
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:11,779
so think about psychology standing in
the center of things

987
00:46:11,779 --> 00:46:12,680
okay

988
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,579
connecting down to the biophysical level
explanation because the brain as the

989
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:19,369
physical basis of mind

990
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:20,699
and connecting off

991
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:23,510
to the socio cultural level of
explanation

992
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:24,999
because the individual

993
00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:26,099
is imbedded

994
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:28,139
in any wider

995
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:30,150
our context

996
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,769
in the end psychology connects up

997
00:46:32,769 --> 00:46:36,099
with lots of different fields of inquiry

998
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:39,689
psychology on share is with palm

999
00:46:39,689 --> 00:46:44,429
dot the philosophy empty of theology and
literature and art fundamental questions

1000
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:47,000
about the nature of human existence

1001
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,979
and hull the individual's experience

1002
00:46:49,979 --> 00:46:52,599
is shared with others

1003
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:54,630
psychology share it with economics

1004
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,220
and sociology

1005
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,309
and history

1006
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:58,599
and after apology

1007
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:03,009
a concern with the relations of
individuals

1008
00:47:03,009 --> 00:47:04,170
society

1009
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:09,369
it shares with biology and physiology
and physical anthropology

1010
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:11,730
the relation between the individual

1011
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,989
and other creatures

1012
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:16,140
and it shares with

1013
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,709
of physics and chemistry and cosmology
uninterested in

1014
00:47:20,709 --> 00:47:25,279
the place of the individual in the
universe as a whole

1015
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:30,389
these are their fields of inquiry
physics chemistry biology sociology

1016
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,729
anthropology

1017
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:34,619
study the world outside the individual

1018
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,410
whether it's the physical world

1019
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:42,470
or the social world psychology studies
what working hard once called

1020
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,650
universe within

1021
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:44,809
the individual

1022
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:45,809
the universe

1023
00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:46,689
that exists

1024
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:47,389
within

1025
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:49,410
the individual mind

1026
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:53,750
will be good talking about all of these
things and more on wednesday

1027
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:58,779
when we begin to look at the brain as
the physical bases on line

1028
00:47:58,779 --> 00:47:59,249
thank you very much
