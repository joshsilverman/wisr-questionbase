1
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:12,229
okay when we begin

2
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:17,039
and before i get to leave first lecture on
psychological development

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,839
well just review the bidding on the exam that
you took last week

4
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,720
uh... thanks to the quick work of the g_s_a_
lies we got that scored very fast

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,529
there was just one bad item number ten

6
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,909
the uh... item analysis psalm uh... revealed

7
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:34,069
and so we we scored that one correct

8
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:36,550
for all responses

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,010
and when we did that

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,810
because distribution of scores of books like
this

11
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,960
means gore about thirty-nine

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,330
median score reporting very very good performance
on the exam

13
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,620
and again you can see

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,080
characteristic

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:59,900
on curve not exactly a verbal distribution
but not bad

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,259
that's the yellow buoy the exam came out

17
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:04,470
as i say it was very very pleased

18
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,800
often a couple of you have frog

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,770
query me about

20
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,110
data input there isn't a great book

21
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,560
i made a couple

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,850
i didn't make couple of others all but the
deadline for requested their hand we scored

23
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,860
your spent runs is wednesday

24
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,300
afternoon so we want to get all the stuff
taken care of

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,470
before the final exam

26
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,490
is is upon us

27
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,590
i posted

28
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,829
complete feedback on the exam to the court's
website united analysis little commentary

29
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,370
on the to the items

30
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,380
on i haven't heard anything all

31
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,250
were close to the forum

32
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,850
about that

33
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:51,259
okay we're gonna talk about thingy development
of mind and especially a personality getting

34
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,510
today

35
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,000
and all in order to do that but i want to
do first is simply too

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,259
all point out

37
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,020
that in the previous lectures

38
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,560
we've taken pretty much taken mind and personality
as a given

39
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,909
we've looked at how

40
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:11,159
normal intact sometimes brain-damaged adults

41
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,750
engage in perception and memory and thinking

42
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,929
we've looked at

43
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:19,079
personality and how we have interacts with

44
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:23,369
the social environment to produce various
aspects of social behavior

45
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:28,139
and what we want to do now is the figure is
to try to understand how we get that way

46
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:33,199
how do we come to proceeded remembering thank
the way we do

47
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,679
how do we get the personalities that we have
that internet shape the environments in which

48
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:41,349
we our work

49
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:46,660
in asking this question of where my obtained
and a personality come from

50
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,029
we can identify reader for weight

51
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:50,810
of answering that question

52
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,089
an aunt or genetic view of development

53
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,409
a file a genetic view of development

54
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:59,319
and any cultural view of development

55
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,579
v

56
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:01,510
why would you know that

57
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,149
view which will take first

58
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,249
all really is concerned with

59
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:07,959
the evolution

60
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,930
mental and behavioral characteristics

61
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,619
evolution doesn't just shape

62
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:16,439
morphology of the body

63
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:21,249
it turns out evolution also shade certain
aspects of how the mind works

64
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:24,139
and certain aspects of behavior

65
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:26,249
and then older time again

66
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:27,719
on psychology

67
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,930
this file a genetic view of development that
is a development

68
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,599
of mind you don't cross species

69
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,559
all was all expressed by uh... the sump you'll
notice comparative psychology

70
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:41,799
which would try to compare

71
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,730
different species of animals

72
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,449
humans chimpanzees rats dogs cats

73
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:50,699
octopus

74
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,250
hauled all fins

75
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,060
whatever

76
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,189
on various mental tasks

77
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:56,900
all specially learning tasks

78
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,909
to see a follow up their various species stacked
up against each other

79
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,760
more recently however this file or genetic
new development

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,760
has been expressed in a relatively new subfield
on psychology known as evolutionary psychology

81
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,819
related for those who've taken as solar sociology
course related ballfield and sociology known

82
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:20,620
as socio biology

83
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,010
and basically what evolutionary psychology
tries to do

84
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,030
is to understand how our mental characteristics

85
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,639
evolved over the course of hominid evolution

86
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,330
on the jet the general idea is that

87
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,080
the way we think about

88
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,240
is something that evolved in this environment
of early adaptation basically the east african

89
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,240
savannah

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,979
somewhere at some time in a place to see there
are a couple

91
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,689
hundred thousand years ago

92
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:50,349
and that that's where our mental characteristics
came from

93
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:54,499
and one of the ideas that the evolutionary
psychologists have

94
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:58,520
is that the players kinds of the errors that
we've sometimes make unreasoning

95
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,410
or due to the fact that are resilient apparatus

96
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,830
our brains evolved in that this environment

97
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,389
are trying to use

98
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,420
although i don't know about the

99
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,169
referendums

100
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:12,020
involved in an earlier environment

101
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,469
to halt

102
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:19,090
think about baker and environment and that's
what leads us to make certain kinds of mistakes

103
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,439
i did not sure

104
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:25,580
haul for you what i think that but that is
a very new trend and uh... the psychology

105
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,780
today

106
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,710
the cultural view of development

107
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,659
has its origins in nineteenth century psychological
anthropology

108
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:38,149
as european countries spain

109
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:39,710
portugal

110
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,440
england

111
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,789
friends

112
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:48,789
germany awg branched out and began to develop
colonies in africa age uh... and south america

113
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,120
early anthropologist began to be interested
in doing mental comparisons all between

114
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,650
believe that if you will the conquerors

115
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,110
and the concord there is an emphasis on earlier
for political psychology on mental characteristics

116
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,910
between so-called advanced societies

117
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,799
uh... and so-called primitive societies

118
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,379
we don't think about

119
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,709
alguna development

120
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,840
onto cultural development quite this way anymore

121
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,470
uh... but still there are certain characteristics
ald

122
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,550
cultures

123
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,959
which may shape

124
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,520
how the people who belong who live in those
cultures

125
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,699
of

126
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:28,889
you know that fake

127
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,470
especially of interest this w of development

128
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,819
is the advent of literacy

129
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:37,549
does being able to read and write

130
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:39,949
make a difference the how people think

131
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,389
we know that being able to read and write

132
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:47,209
eases the demands on human memory between
have lecture notes

133
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,930
for example is that it had to do it

134
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,780
figure out

135
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,659
retain at all using the method of low side
or something like that

136
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,270
and that may very well change

137
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,889
how we remember

138
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,340
all similarly

139
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,280
forms of economic development

140
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,060
reforms a political development

141
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,190
it's been argued

142
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,440
all of the shape

143
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,419
how the individuals who live under those various
kinds of regimes of work

144
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,770
again this idea that

145
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,339
cultural development

146
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:17,110
affects how people in that culture think

147
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,680
on is a pop

148
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,409
identified with a field psychology known as
cultural psychology

149
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,670
which basically

150
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,660
begins with the assumption that there is a
diverse city of mind

151
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:36,660
as well as diverse city all of gender all
raise sold off socioeconomic status whatever

152
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,590
that not all people think the same way

153
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,440
that people of different cultures

154
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,810
may think differently in certain respects

155
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,420
and those differences in

156
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,079
modes of thought

157
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,230
differences and habits of thought

158
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,970
will although that will all affect

159
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,809
the relations between all of those cultures

160
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:01,089
the file a genetic to development cultural
view of the relevant both very important but

161
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,930
they're not going to be the focus all of these
lectures

162
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,740
and are not really the focus of your textbook
material either

163
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,199
off the lectures and the tax focus on the
third view of development

164
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,359
which is known as the aren't road genetic
view of development

165
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,599
which has to do

166
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,810
with the development of of mind and behavior

167
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:25,079
overload mobile life course onto individual
species members

168
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,180
from birth

169
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:33,180
through infancy the childhood adolescence
adulthood middle-age old age seven cents

170
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,100
hollow do with the various modes of thought
change

171
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,950
how does personality how do well

172
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,399
forms of social interaction change

173
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,430
as the all person the individual person moves
through this particular life-cycle

174
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,690
this is a traditional focus of what's known
as

175
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,439
developmental psychology

176
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:56,680
very big subfield uh... in psychology

177
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,830
and again we can break down

178
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,139
the uh... be you know interest of development
psychology

179
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:04,340
into true broad categories

180
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,770
cognitive development

181
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,960
how thinking develops as the individual develops

182
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,760
and the social and personality development

183
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:19,310
how person how we get our personalities and
how those personalities change over time

184
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,870
your textbook depaz adolph lot of attention
the to both these aspects of development

185
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,970
especially good i think is glickman's chapter
on cognitive development

186
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,120
i'm not going to have too much to say about
cognitive development in these lectures

187
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,979
what i want to do instead

188
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:38,459
is to focus on social personality development

189
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:39,820
and ask the question

190
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,900
of basically

191
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,440
how do we get the way we are

192
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,730
each of us has some level of

193
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,260
extra version and eroticism in agreeable this
and conscientious those

194
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,709
that of facts are

195
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:54,459
although our intercourse with other people

196
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:57,700
and a question as how we get that way

197
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,880
the way we usually think about this

198
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,089
is that we get the way we are

199
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:04,450
through what combination of forces

200
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,549
that are generally doggone thing

201
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:08,570
subsumed under the rubric of

202
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,459
nature

203
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:12,180
and nurture this is a dichotomy

204
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,490
that was off

205
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,690
originally proposed

206
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:20,170
uh... by two hundred fifty years ago by surprises
colton darwin's on cousin

207
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,440
and in spot erred by uh... passage from shakespeare

208
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,660
on in the tempest where of prospero says no
taliban

209
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,440
the taliban with the devil

210
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,550
well boring devil on whose nature nurture
can never stick that is taliban's boorda double

211
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,690
and nothing but you do to him is going to
change him and anyway

212
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,650
simply argued that

213
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,669
shakespearian dichotomy of nature and nurture

214
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:48,110
was a convenient way to separating

215
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,239
two different kinds of developmental inference
that all of them influences

216
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:55,509
the two different fault uh... elements

217
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:58,170
of which personality is composed

218
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,399
and golden

219
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,380
went on to define

220
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,189
palm

221
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:02,960
his terms

222
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,930
naturist although the man although the person

223
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,620
brings in tune with the world with him

224
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,310
nowadays we think about in terms of the individuals
genetic and almonds

225
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,290
what genes he or she is carrying with jeans
here she's been given but i

226
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,620
the repair roads

227
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,610
or moral endowment

228
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,309
although

229
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:27,689
various aspects of constitution whether the
person on has any physical infirmities ans

230
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:31,860
bored with any physical and for all of the
uh... differences or whatever

231
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,170
or for that matter individual differences
in uh... in temperament

232
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,100
all by the convoy contrast

233
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,179
nurturer

234
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,040
on gold find as

235
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,950
every influence that affects the person

236
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,220
from birth

237
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,190
onward

238
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,140
and that includes both the physical environment

239
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,740
physical circumstances under which in individuals
raise

240
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,320
but especially the social environment

241
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,309
the are going to be matrix of other people

242
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:00,540
into which the person is boring

243
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,139
and nurture generally covers things like

244
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,829
the individuals history of social learning

245
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:09,459
or socialization regimes are imposed on the
individual

246
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:10,500
but basically

247
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,790
everything that happens to the individual

248
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,480
over it his or her life courts

249
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,440
now it just to all make a point in passing

250
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,670
you've seen this dichotomy of nature and nurture
before you thought of the perception chapter

251
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:30,440
where we talked about are philosophical nativism
versus philosophical empiricism

252
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,500
the database

253
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,699
believe that

254
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:34,760
all

255
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,870
individuals were born with certain kinds of
innate knowledge

256
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,729
whereas the empiricism

257
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:42,040
believe that

258
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,670
the individual was born the aid blank slate
with pablo rostock in latin

259
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,670
on which

260
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,090
all of the individual was written buying experience

261
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,829
the nature and nurture dichotomy

262
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:56,170
as some of the same characteristics

263
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,340
when we discover that somebody is high on
extra version or high under rod a schism or

264
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,530
something like that

265
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,939
we could do you think

266
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:05,990
that he or she dot that way

267
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:10,810
it is just naturally that weight because they
were genes for these things for example

268
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,959
or we can think

269
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,740
that the person somehow learned see that way

270
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,779
through a history uh...

271
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:19,330
social

272
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,440
expertise

273
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,320
and in fact if you look in the literature

274
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,290
at the traditional literature on nature and
nurture

275
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,390
you'll see

276
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,960
uh... in in some ways

277
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,180
the hall

278
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,870
deal

279
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,150
conflict between nature and nurture in development

280
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,509
recapitulate in some ways

281
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:43,250
dot khan that conflict between the person
and the environment

282
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,650
that we talked about in the last of for lectures

283
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,539
for example it very common

284
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:49,640
to c

285
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,500
nature and nurture

286
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,320
genes and environment

287
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,920
opposed to each other

288
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,800
one

289
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,930
was important

290
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,179
and the odd on wasn't important at all

291
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,690
a kind of oppositional

292
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,820
stands between

293
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,330
nature and nurture

294
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:10,400
or are somewhat more altman co comfortable
stands for people that they are all well it's

295
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,450
both

296
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,510
on somebody's high-end extra virgin

297
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:18,519
they've got jeans for your extra virgin and
they've also been brought up to be actor burt

298
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,209
that nature and nurture

299
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,000
are both important personality development

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,499
but that they are somehow

301
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:25,500
independent

302
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,700
of each other

303
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,340
ceo word like independence

304
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,399
special intercourse run by me

305
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,090
he wonders and that's not the final answer

306
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,210
that in fact

307
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,329
what bergen or whatever

308
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:38,360
his house nature and nurture interact

309
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,570
to produce our mental characteristics

310
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,559
to give us

311
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,650
the personalities

312
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,780
that we have

313
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,640
if in fact there is a kind of

314
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,430
what i like to think of as a developmental
corollary

315
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,400
to the doctrine of interaction ism that we
talked about last time

316
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,380
remember that the doctrine of interaction
is absurd

317
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,630
that person's on

318
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,550
fireman's are not separate from each other

319
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:07,550
they interact in a very real sense a person
bizarre part of his or her own environment

320
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,150
in the same way when it comes to development

321
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,930
we're going to see that development

322
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:16,340
isn't just something that happens to the individual

323
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,360
okay

324
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,699
not something that you're coming to dubai
virtual forces

325
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,839
completely outside your control

326
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,680
but just as the person as a part of his or
her open environment

327
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,350
so it's going to turn out

328
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,670
that the child ism agent

329
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,460
of his

330
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,940
worker

331
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,090
development

332
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,059
we see this

333
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,630
all very clearly

334
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,630
all when we try that we're going to look at
something like the development of gender identity

335
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,150
and gender roles

336
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,170
what happens

337
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,319
when a little boy or a little girl

338
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:49,929
grows up to be a more or less masculine man

339
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:51,490
on more or less

340
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,260
feminine all-female

341
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,949
well it turns out the blood turns out that
that developmental process can be viewed

342
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:05,949
through the lens all be person-to-person situation
fraction and we can see n p psychological

343
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,009
development of all

344
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,310
or the of gender

345
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,250
evocation selection

346
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,090
behavioral manipulation and cognitive transformation

347
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,260
all drew this very briefly

348
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,979
we've already talked about how

349
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:25,760
that child's gender structures the fireman's
in which that child is going to be raise

350
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,930
that physical appearance all of the newborn
infant

351
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,839
whether it looks like a boy

352
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,529
or whether it looks like a girl

353
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:33,720
is going to determine

354
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,410
whether it's bedroom is painted blue or pink

355
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,060
whether against twenty trucks or dull carriages
to play with

356
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,910
weather gets footballs or dolls what it meant
that when it when an adult straight

357
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,710
all of that

358
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:52,970
the is taught environmental change that is
evoked by the physical appearance of the trial

359
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,399
little bit later on

360
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,909
children begin to notice their own gender
may begin to

361
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:00,530
think of themselves as boys or girls

362
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,760
and data begin that they've been recognize
themselves as boys and girls

363
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,540
and they begin to actively model their behavior

364
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,690
on or other people who look like now

365
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,330
so little be little girls

366
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,600
start emulating

367
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,660
the older girls and the women and their environment

368
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:23,010
little boys star daniel eighteen the older
boys and the older girls and their environment

369
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,419
they are selecting an environment for themselves
and what they say

370
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:30,020
i want to be with those people that look like
me

371
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,799
on a whatever those people who have a look
like me

372
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,059
that is the trial selecting

373
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,530
his or her or environment

374
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,830
similarly

375
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,370
there are examples engender development

376
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,580
all behavioral manipulation

377
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,950
it's just a matter of fact

378
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,150
nevermind what

379
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,330
reasons are

380
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,720
but it's just a matter of fact that the average
little boy

381
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,559
has somewhat higher activity levels than the
average little girl does it's got something

382
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,390
to do with testosterone uh... we don't have
to go into the details there

383
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,840
but it dog a bottle of little boy in an environment

384
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,270
is going to make that it

385
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,150
different

386
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,419
if there was a little girl in that environment

387
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:12,520
all color in his or her place

388
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,490
so gender activities and

389
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,960
on the gender differences in activity level

390
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,270
our behaviors lead to give rise to be haters

391
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,779
that change the environment

392
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:22,950
for the child

393
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,309
and then finally

394
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:29,750
uh... as the arms of the child gets to be
age four five six begins to have a

395
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,200
begins to getty

396
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,090
all more or less fixed identity for itself
as a little boy you're a little girl

397
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,299
then what happens

398
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:39,779
is that the child on begins to

399
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,299
or actively

400
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:42,200
embrace

401
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,080
various gender appropriate behaviors

402
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,450
as they are defined by the situation

403
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,580
all allied

404
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,540
all that that is that their department of
child's all the culture

405
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,570
so it's not just that the tribe the kid says
i want to be with those people will look like

406
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,850
me

407
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,759
the child says

408
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,919
i'm a little boy

409
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,870
i wanted to avoid things

410
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,840
i'm a little girl

411
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,669
i want to do

412
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,500
girl things whatever they are

413
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,970
all in new york ny barb

414
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,290
okay so again

415
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,070
just a small example

416
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:15,370
of how various modes of persons situation
interaction

417
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:20,430
play themselves out in activity in the development
of the individual

418
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,549
sold at in each of these ways

419
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:23,710
the child

420
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,369
exit active role in its development

421
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:28,100
of becomes an agent

422
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,309
of his or

423
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,400
old development

424
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,860
traditionally however

425
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,240
the nature under juror

426
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,309
dichotomy

427
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,909
has been viewed in terms of one that counter
poses

428
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:42,040
jeans and environment

429
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,520
and that's going to be the theme for the rest
of the lecture on today

430
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,560
here is where we begin

431
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,530
this is a deal

432
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,900
by you know that's near albany when genome
all twenty three

433
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,510
pairs of chromosomes

434
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,299
there's an extra was so

435
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:01,960
there was a white chromosome into of so-called
sex chromosomes

436
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,460
this is what they look like

437
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,970
that's what they're what what looked like
about nineteen seventy two when this particular

438
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,690
illustration or was off was published

439
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,970
this is what the human genome

440
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,640
looks like

441
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,669
just a couple weeks ago on craig banter who
is one of the awful pioneers all board of

442
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,669
of genetic analysis has produced published

443
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:26,350
the first genetic autobiography

444
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,999
is publishing autobiography

445
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:34,700
that is on where the individual chapters are
dictated by if you if you will by his jeans

446
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,559
here's his

447
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:40,540
this is that there is a poem gene shamir are
taken from all of the new york times

448
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,490
twenty-two

449
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,470
uh... peers chromosomes and an external body

450
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,639
and what bob enters don

451
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,120
is going to identify on chromosome one

452
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,770
i've done gene that's linked to heart attacks

453
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,479
on

454
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,830
chromosomes seven

455
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,460
another gene that's mine

456
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,660
for heart attacks

457
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,160
here on chromosome all grow chromosome twelve

458
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,560
budget investment will be city an insulin
resistance

459
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,799
here on chromosome twenty one

460
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,389
it gene that is linked

461
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:11,520
to of ordered them to alcoholism

462
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,759
the advance since nineteen seventy two war
in nineteen fifty four

463
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,940
on thundered through wanted to die

464
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:24,600
is that we'd be going to identify individual
genes that dispose people to have certain

465
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,370
kinds of pomp

466
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,139
physical

467
00:21:27,139 --> 00:21:28,490
and behavioral

468
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,380
and mental characteristics

469
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,410
there are

470
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,909
in the kind of short had

471
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:34,480
jeans four

472
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,970
things i've got a gene for alcoholism i got
a gene for breast cancer i've got a gene for

473
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,610
possible conviction or whatever

474
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,750
behind this idea that there are genes

475
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,070
four things

476
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,880
is a particular version on genetic determination

477
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,830
the idea that somehow genes are decisive

478
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,240
in this process

479
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,240
center doesn't believe this is a more sophisticated

480
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,380
all view of all of genetic

481
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,719
uh...

482
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:02,590
heritage

483
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,559
that most people but the when you read about
this stuff in the newspapers

484
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,380
you begin to see this cut this idea that there
are genes four things

485
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,429
presumably

486
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:15,400
on creating these things out of whole cloth

487
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,730
all quite a bit

488
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,970
but in fact

489
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,540
as we now know

490
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,690
genes expressed themselves through the environment

491
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,470
there's no genetic influences in the absence
of environmental influence

492
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,790
g king's and environments interact in various
kinds of ways

493
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,590
so when we think about

494
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,980
how nature and nurture genes and environment
a direct

495
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,700
we want to distinguish first

496
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,889
between and individuals genotype and his or
her

497
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:47,149
phenotype

498
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:51,419
the genotype you can think of because of biological
potential

499
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,300
what you bring into the world with you

500
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,420
as part of your genetic endowment

501
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,690
craig venter brings with him into the world

502
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,410
although certain genes

503
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,100
that palm bay

504
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,120
to some extent

505
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,890
predispose them to be haven particular all
kinds of ways

506
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,210
but the individuals phenotype

507
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,690
the way adventure or anybody else actually
turns out

508
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,429
is what happens when the genotype

509
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:19,530
inderpal

510
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,380
pollen counters a particular environment

511
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,070
so that you could actually have

512
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,850
people with different genotypes

513
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,299
but have the same phenotype different genotypes
but the same law

514
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:35,830
risk of heart failure or restore or behold
level of extra virgin you could have

515
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:41,140
or people with the same genotype but different
phenotypes for reasons that will talk about

516
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,360
here and admit

517
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,519
this happens

518
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,830
because

519
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,030
jeans interact with environments and we can
identify

520
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:54,010
three different kinds of environments that
all of that interact with the end of the fiji

521
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,710
the individuals dena type

522
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,490
to produce the individuals eventid

523
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,310
the prenatal environment

524
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,200
the environment all of the uterus

525
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,580
the womb in which the fetus

526
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,240
develops more the first

527
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,230
for the first nine months to nine months before
birth

528
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,029
depending on what goes on in

529
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:16,490
the uterus

530
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,450
the abid individuals with the same genotype

531
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,680
baby born

532
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,360
quite different from each other

533
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,560
one reason why women who are pregnant

534
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,270
are encouraged not to smoke

535
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,440
encouraged not to drink alcohol

536
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,640
because that stuff goes right to the fetus

537
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,300
on thoughts carry wrote that carried to the
bloodstream

538
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,720
and can affect

539
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,950
the of peter's

540
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,539
through the prenatal environment

541
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,810
that we have the perinatal environment

542
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:46,300
perry the greek word for around arrive on
the time of birth

543
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,730
various kinds of things can happen

544
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,570
his aides are very difficult labor for example
beckon have consequences for the kid

545
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:59,640
if the obstetrician drops the kid on the floor
that could have consequences all four o_ printed

546
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,559
alternate phone somebody go against too much
or too little oxygen to the infant

547
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,980
that could have consequences as well

548
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,330
and then finally

549
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,440
the postnatal environment everyday basically
from the time of birth on

550
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,870
can have an effect

551
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,860
on the individual

552
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,710
on of the individual as well

553
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,780
halloween began to understand

554
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,890
how we begin to ask the mate

555
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,570
but various contributions fog jeans and environment

556
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,630
separately and in interaction to paul

557
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,340
to various aspects of personality

558
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:41,690
the technical way to do this the easiest way
to do this the most popular way to do this

559
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,320
is by virtue of

560
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,440
twin studies

561
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,169
where all of the method in behavior genetics

562
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:49,740
where we basically right too

563
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,860
identified the genetic and environmental

564
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,929
contributions

565
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:54,880
too hard

566
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,270
to individuality

567
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,919
by looking by comparing

568
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,860
identical and fraternal twins

569
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,520
models i got a twins

570
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,460
so-called identical twins

571
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,500
are the product of a single fertilized egg
that divides

572
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,600
early in

573
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
gestation

574
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,440
so models i got it wins

575
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,790
have one hundred percent of their genes in
common they are genetically identical

576
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,410
for all intents and purposes

577
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,800
genetically identical

578
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,980
by contrast

579
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:28,470
dies i gotta twins so-called fraternal twins
which of the product out to different

580
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,809
fertilized eggs

581
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:33,470
they have only a fifty percent of their genes
in common

582
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,940
on average

583
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,700
of models i got a twins are identical dies
and other twins

584
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,720
are no more like genetically that any two
siblings

585
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,920
or

586
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,640
also you can imagine now

587
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,870
if a particular

588
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,629
trait

589
00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:51,399
like extra version norton around a schism

590
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:53,029
is inherited

591
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:54,310
true the extent

592
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,480
that a particular personality trait is inherited

593
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,320
we will expect a fine

594
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,090
that models i got it twins are more alike

595
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,590
on that tree

596
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,289
dies i gotta twins that is the essential logic

597
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:10,070
of behavior genetics

598
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,060
if it ever trade is inherited

599
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:18,110
to the extent to trade is inherited identical
twins should be more alike on that trait

600
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,480
offer turtle wins

601
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,520
on should be

602
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,330
on gets more interesting uh... you know the
in a moment

603
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,690
lol but here's the method again

604
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,090
what we would do

605
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,240
we're interested in

606
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:35,290
genetic and environmental contributions to
a trait like extra version bergeron a schism

607
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,730
we did minister a personality questionnaire

608
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,250
assess individual differences and traits

609
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,820
and then we would look at the similarity between

610
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:49,380
as measured by that statistic known as the
correlation coefficient

611
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,620
remember that the correlation coefficient
as a statistic

612
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,860
that expresses

613
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,240
the strength

614
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,450
and direction of the relationship between
two variables

615
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,610
if a correlation is positive

616
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,130
high scores on one

617
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:05,620
are accompanied by high scores on the other

618
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:12,620
effect on correlation is negative high scores
on one or accompanied by low scores on another

619
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,350
the higher the correlation

620
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:19,000
bus stronger the relationship somewhat but
the greater dissimilarity

621
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,700
so we'll be doing is we look at the correlations
between twins

622
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,519
on various trade measures

623
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:26,440
as a measure albee

624
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,720
on degree awm

625
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,399
similarity the degree of resemblance between
them

626
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:34,750
infiltrate is completely at inherited

627
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:39,409
if it comes with a particular trade is completely
determined by the jeans

628
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:44,270
we would expect models i got it wins to be
precisely identical

629
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:48,100
with respect

630
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,110
or

631
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:54,309
offered sprit something dichotomous we'd expect
a hundred percent uh... allied concordance

632
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:55,720
if want we had a tree

633
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,130
would expect the other point

634
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,840
to have the tree think about

635
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,250
for a second identical twins

636
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,799
or of the same gender

637
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,149
one hundred percent of the time

638
00:29:05,149 --> 00:29:07,310
ones mail

639
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,549
is going to email

640
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:12,539
but fraternal twins that's not the case if
one kittens mail

641
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,670
the other twins could email only fifty percent
of the time

642
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,700
so if they don't trade is wholly inherited

643
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,340
we'd expect the correlation among ball between
fraternal twins

644
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,580
to be about

645
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,670
point five all ocracoke words written of about

646
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,980
fifty percent

647
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,580
if a trade is wholly inherited

648
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,309
we'd expect the correlation between to individuals
to work

649
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:36,220
on related genetically

650
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,070
no blood of the relationship

651
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,039
there would be essentially in random

652
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,560
association

653
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,890
here is an example

654
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,510
imagine the we've got

655
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:52,620
a scale of extra version that goes from zero
to sixty begin this questionnaire to a set

656
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,680
of twins

657
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,740
here are ten pairs of twins

658
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,630
here are

659
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,710
their scores

660
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,039
on the scale of extra version

661
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:05,130
on for twenty rate one twins course pointing
the other twins scores eighteen

662
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,620
for twin pair ten

663
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,730
one twins scores fifty-eight

664
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,630
one twin scores fifty-seven just by i've always
yet

665
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,929
you can see that

666
00:30:13,929 --> 00:30:17,789
these twins are very similar to each other
in terms of extra version

667
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:19,360
if you actually calculate

668
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,620
the correlation

669
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,870
you'd thought of you get a correlation of
point nine nine

670
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,509
are almost uh... of almost perfect

671
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:27,740
or the correlation

672
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,370
all children that these twins

673
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,610
are highly

674
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,539
all of highly similar to each other

675
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,740
in personnel

676
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,470
now this is made up data

677
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,279
here's what the real data looks like

678
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:43,809
this is research by job lol unpublished dose
of years ago numbers haven't changed at all

679
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,320
on since then

680
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,010
lol live administered questionnaire measures
of the big five personality traits

681
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:54,800
neuroticism extra version agreeable this conscientious
nissen openness

682
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,260
two sets of models i got a good dot i dot
gotta twins

683
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,649
calculator the correlations between them

684
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:04,549
and this is what he got a pattern of correlations
that looks like this

685
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:08,309
the average correlation for each of these
personality traits

686
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:11,740
four bottles i got it identical twins

687
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,200
about point five oh little bit less

688
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,049
the average correlation

689
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:18,960
four died psychotic

690
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,169
fraternal twins

691
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,539
was about half that

692
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:25,970
roughly about point to five point two six
on on average

693
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,779
the fact that model as i got it twins

694
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:30,429
or more alike

695
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:34,770
on these trades that are diver gotta twins

696
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:39,590
prima fascia evidence that is on first glance
on the face of it

697
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:43,509
of evidence for a genetic contribution of
personnel

698
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:45,720
a if there's a genetic contribution of

699
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,779
personality

700
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,299
we would expect

701
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:53,549
identical twins who were genetically identical
to be more like on that trait then fraternal

702
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:56,690
twins who are not genetically identical

703
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,980
and that's exactly the pattern bc

704
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,830
these are far from perfect correlations

705
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,820
okay that's more that's more the story to
calm

706
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,179
but the fact that these correlations

707
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:09,080
routinely

708
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,679
higher than these correlations

709
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,290
and z correlations routinely higher than the
z correlation

710
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:19,149
tells us genes have something to do with it

711
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:22,440
that's not all their is because obviously

712
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,080
models i gotta twins

713
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,590
do more then we share

714
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,500
jeans

715
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,909
they also share

716
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:30,059
environments

717
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:34,809
unless they're separated at birth which happens
but doesn't happen very often there raised

718
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:39,050
by the same parents the race in the same hosts
of the house to go to the same schools they

719
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,880
have some of the same teachers

720
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,250
and uh... and so on

721
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,709
models i got it twins

722
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:46,270
have environments

723
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:51,029
that are more alike then dies i gotta twins
born on when siblings

724
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:52,929
after all they're the same sex

725
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,260
they look like each other

726
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:58,910
people got a mistake them for each other are
the good beechwood to be treated more alike

727
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,020
that dies i gotta twins are

728
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,730
so the question is

729
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,010
just because

730
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,259
models i gotta twins resemble each other

731
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:13,900
doesn't necessarily mean that that's because
a trait is result caused by jeans

732
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,570
how can we tease apart

733
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:19,519
these genetic and environmental contributions
to personality

734
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,200
here's how we do it

735
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,390
first we want to distinguish between through
different aspects of the environment

736
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,960
what's known as the share environment

737
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,660
and band on sheraton bar

738
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,270
the share of environment

739
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,370
refers to all the aspects of the environment

740
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:39,049
that children would be in the same family

741
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:40,860
have in common

742
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,870
on

743
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,740
two identical twins will have

744
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,220
the same parents

745
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,380
at the same brothers and sisters their raised
in the same arms legalistic church there in

746
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,799
the same neighborhood

747
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,320
or all that stuff

748
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,380
on but that's referred to as the sheraton
barman

749
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,129
witcher shared in common

750
00:33:58,129 --> 00:33:59,169
by siblings

751
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:00,950
in the family

752
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,700
but then that there is also

753
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,880
then on we share in bar

754
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,139
sometimes referred to as within the family
barriers

755
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,799
because this refers to

756
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:11,929
although things

757
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:14,199
children in the same family

758
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,749
that are not uncommon

759
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:20,989
all the things that all of the refer to their
order you need to experiences

760
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:23,109
so for example yen

761
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:24,240
uh... in families

762
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,249
some siblings are older

763
00:34:27,249 --> 00:34:31,429
others are younger the older siblings take
care of the younger ones

764
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:34,320
the younger ones are taken care of by the
older ones

765
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,700
that is eight

766
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,379
difference

767
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:37,500
in thong

768
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,429
that's it but that's about it than aspect
of the non shared environment

769
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,720
even twins

770
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,629
uh... bulls say oh i'm older

771
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:48,270
hear all about thirty seconds of your older
by two minutes or whatever

772
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:52,429
but still twins will distinguish between themselves
in terms of

773
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,109
and who was on younger

774
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:55,979
gender

775
00:34:55,979 --> 00:35:01,280
boys in a family art than a different environment
somewhat than the girls on in a family

776
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,560
on and so on all one kid joins the boy scouts
one boyd joins the boy scouts

777
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,270
one boyd joins all the local all uh... football
team

778
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,720
there have different

779
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,259
environments outside the family

780
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:17,400
one kid reads tolstoy

781
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,569
the other kid reads nije

782
00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:20,359
they have

783
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:25,349
very different environments is well uh...
outside our outside the family

784
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:29,160
so we want to distinguish not just between
genes and environment

785
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,810
we want to distinguish between two different
aspects of the environment the environment

786
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:37,660
that children of family have in common and
the environments

787
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,890
then our unique for each child

788
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,149
in the family

789
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:42,549
and it turns out

790
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:44,749
that this twins study method

791
00:35:44,749 --> 00:35:50,849
which can which allows us to as to make the
contributions of genetic factors to all

792
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,559
floated to personality

793
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,640
also will allow us to estimate

794
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,400
the contribution of the shared

795
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,899
and and i'm sure on environment and here's
how it goes

796
00:36:00,899 --> 00:36:03,049
total variance

797
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:07,700
represented by the bell curve here's the distribution
of extra virgin some people low

798
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:13,369
some people high lots of people fall in the
middle where does that variance come from

799
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:16,790
sum it up douglas on the net variances genetic
variants

800
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,289
is due to individual differences in gena types

801
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:23,260
all other variances due to environmental barron's

802
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,989
individual differences in environment

803
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:29,399
both shared and i'm not sure environment

804
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:33,189
we begin by saying that poll burials armstrong
treat

805
00:36:33,189 --> 00:36:34,390
is the psalm

806
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,980
of the genetic variants

807
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,899
and the environmental variance

808
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:41,250
we breakdown the environmental variance into

809
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:44,540
that aspect of the environment that shared
among family members

810
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,540
and that aspect of the environment

811
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,790
that is not share

812
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,089
along family members

813
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:53,730
and we can use the twin study method to estimate
the contributions

814
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,149
of each of these

815
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:56,780
doctors

816
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,489
and here's what we do it

817
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:00,959
total variance

818
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:04,879
is a sum of genetic parents and environmental
very

819
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:06,910
we can estimate the genetic

820
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,279
contribution

821
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:11,039
to a variance by simple formula

822
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:17,639
of doubling the difference between the model
saigonnet twins and the ties i gotta twins

823
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,999
arm

824
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:22,109
the mathematics for that little

825
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:24,709
if you think about it for a second

826
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:28,209
i'm g if a trade is wholly inherited

827
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:33,029
models i got a twins will be hundred-percent
alike they'll handle correlate one point out

828
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:35,789
if that same traders holy inherited

829
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:37,220
so i thought about it wins

830
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,830
will correlate with each other

831
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,079
point five oh

832
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:43,219
double the difference

833
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:48,159
perfect get one hundred-percent of the variances
genetic there

834
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,339
the environment is made up of the shared environment
and the not shared environment

835
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:54,869
we estimate the non shared environment

836
00:37:54,869 --> 00:38:00,329
by whatever leftover when you know what the
models like da dik resemblances

837
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:01,200
remember

838
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,699
if a trait is wholly determined by genes

839
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,619
we expect

840
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,820
identical twins

841
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,899
to be completely alike

842
00:38:09,899 --> 00:38:15,509
any differences between

843
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:16,999
identical twins

844
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:19,089
can't be due to genetic differences

845
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:19,770
because

846
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,959
there weren't any genetic differences

847
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:24,369
any differences between identical twins

848
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,989
can't be due to the shared environment

849
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:31,599
because they share the environment their race
in the same house by the same parents

850
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,040
all any differences between on pedicle twins

851
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,569
must be attributable two nine nine sheridan
bar

852
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:40,979
to the twins unique experiences

853
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:42,349
once we've estimated

854
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:44,099
the genetic variants

855
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,349
the variance due to the non charred environment

856
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:52,059
we can get the of variance due to the shared
environment basically

857
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:53,289
subtraction

858
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,400
here's how it works

859
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,319
on magic we've got

860
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:03,809
models i gotta clean correlation perfect one
point o_ dies i got a twin correlation appoint

861
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:04,829
final

862
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:07,210
plug these values into the formulas

863
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,999
double the difference between models i got
a good guys i got a twins

864
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:13,079
two times point five oh

865
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,439
all the variance is genetic

866
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:17,920
for the not answered environment

867
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,870
one minus ends the envy is one so there is
no

868
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:25,569
variance due to the nine short environment

869
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:29,449
variance through the shared environment is
what's left over and there's nothing left

870
00:39:29,449 --> 00:39:30,579
over

871
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:32,569
if you see a pattern like this

872
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:33,680
you've got a trait

873
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,760
that is entirely determined by the jeans

874
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,439
in which the environment plays no role whatsoever

875
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:45,399
but now let's take another example tomatoes
i got a correlation is

876
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:46,819
point five oh

877
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,569
advise i got a correlation

878
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:50,239
is point for road

879
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:55,679
double the difference between mc twins and
easy twins to get an estimate of genetic variance

880
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,169
twenty percent of the variances do the jeans

881
00:39:59,169 --> 00:40:01,649
for the nine charter environment

882
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,710
you take the m z correlation subtracted from
one

883
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,539
half of the variance is due to the non shared
environment

884
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,710
further shared environment subtract what you've
already got

885
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,550
there's thirty percent leftover

886
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,829
thirty percent of the variance is due

887
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:17,510
here

888
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,039
environment

889
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:20,890
here's another example

890
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,990
higher and z correlation

891
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,449
pointed out

892
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:27,880
but also a hired easy correlation point seven
oh

893
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,379
double the difference

894
00:40:29,379 --> 00:40:30,960
two times point one oh

895
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,509
twenty percent of the various attributable
to jeans

896
00:40:34,509 --> 00:40:37,479
one minus eighty one by this point eighty

897
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:40,229
twenty percent of the parents do not share
the barman

898
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,010
subtract those from one

899
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,759
sixty percent of the variance in this case

900
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:46,729
is built for the sheraton barb

901
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:50,390
even though d_m_z_ correlation is as high
as it is

902
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,059
it's still the case in this example

903
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:56,200
sixty percent of the variance most of the
various is due

904
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,549
to this year

905
00:40:58,549 --> 00:40:59,489
one more

906
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:03,800
because this is the where we're going this
is the visa correlations that you thought

907
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,169
in the table before

908
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:07,569
emes e_ correlation of point five oh

909
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:11,729
easy correlation of point to fly double the
difference between them

910
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:14,909
fifty percent of the variance attributable
to jeans

911
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:16,429
one minus fifty

912
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:20,389
fifty percent of the variance attributable
to the non shared environment

913
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:23,119
what's left over in this case is nothing

914
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,659
attributable

915
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:26,419
the share environment

916
00:41:26,419 --> 00:41:29,479
these are abstract examples

917
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:33,429
now let's go back to lowlands data

918
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:37,250
where we found the actual correlations for
the big five trades

919
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,520
frenzy twins

920
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,759
roughly point four eight

921
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:43,399
pretty easy twins roughly

922
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:44,400
point to six

923
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,019
on average

924
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:48,039
plug these values into the figures

925
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,149
here's the one for actor version

926
00:41:50,149 --> 00:41:54,640
correlation applied for a frenzy twins correlation
a point to a four-fold

927
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,980
easy twins

928
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,289
double the difference

929
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:59,900
forty percent of the variance attributable
to

930
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,459
genetic factors

931
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:03,879
one minus the mc correlation

932
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:07,879
fifty two percent of the various attributable
to the bond shared environment

933
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:11,119
what's left over is nothing

934
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,649
attributable

935
00:42:12,649 --> 00:42:13,560
the shared

936
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,579
environment

937
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:19,079
when you run these calculations for all five
of the big five traits

938
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,059
you see three things

939
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:23,919
really really clearly

940
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:27,699
for each army has been five personality traits

941
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:34,239
there is a substantial amount of variance
that is determined

942
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:36,250
somewhere between thirty five

943
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:40,919
and forty five percent of the variance on
each of these trades

944
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:44,259
attributable to genetic factors

945
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:46,220
very little

946
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,040
variance

947
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,799
is attributable to the sheraton environment

948
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:51,430
that is to the environment

949
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:55,890
that children that these children have by
virtue of being in this members of the same

950
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,420
family raised in the same household

951
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,299
by the same parents

952
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:01,270
however

953
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,939
a great deal of the variance

954
00:43:03,939 --> 00:43:06,980
is attributable about fifty percent on average

955
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,399
isn't ridable to their non shared environment

956
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:11,349
despite

957
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:16,619
by genetic contribution to each of these fob
igf-i personality traits

958
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:18,359
there is still

959
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:19,569
very large

960
00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:21,849
environmental contribution

961
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,030
most of that contribution

962
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:24,829
comes from that

963
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:27,229
not on sheraton virb

964
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,289
not the sheraton bar

965
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:30,349
it's not what

966
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:33,009
children the same family

967
00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:38,929
by virtue of even the same that way that makes
extroverted erotic or whatever it is these

968
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:40,550
unique experiences

969
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,859
and then finally

970
00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:43,859
if anything

971
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:45,679
benign shared environment

972
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:47,339
is more powerful

973
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:48,479
than the jeans

974
00:43:48,479 --> 00:43:52,829
nine showed environment is certainly more
powerful than the shared environment

975
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:57,180
and i'm sure the barman is well probably more
powerful than the genes as well

976
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,459
this up pattern with the over and over again

977
00:44:00,459 --> 00:44:04,479
here is a pattern tears out to be delivered
genetic study published just a couple of months

978
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,219
ago

979
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:09,259
on what they call age of sexual debut

980
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:11,579
age at your for sexual intercourse

981
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:13,139
they did it work and study

982
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:18,359
farthest and they found that there was a significant
genetic factor

983
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:20,319
very little contribution

984
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,230
from the from the shared environment

985
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,519
they are able to interview should

986
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:25,989
factors operating

987
00:44:25,989 --> 00:44:27,319
within the family

988
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:29,969
a huge contribution

989
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:31,639
benign shared environment

990
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:32,580
so again

991
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,359
something like something as simple as ager
first intercourse

992
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,139
there is a genetic component

993
00:44:38,139 --> 00:44:40,929
there's a big environmental component

994
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:45,559
uh... are not shared environment

995
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:47,040
greater than the share

996
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,749
environment in terms of determining when that's
gonna happen

997
00:44:50,749 --> 00:44:53,550
here is another off guard this study

998
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:58,539
of the study off from the university of virginia
twin study of political attitudes

999
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:02,589
where on twins were asked to fill out a questionnaire
which they were asked about

1000
00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:05,590
various liberal and conservative along

1001
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:08,129
attitudes

1002
00:45:08,129 --> 00:45:11,170
here we have the correlations for

1003
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:15,229
measure of liberalism political liberalism
versus conservativism

1004
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:16,770
models i gotta twins

1005
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,789

1006
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:21,159
size i gotta twins correlated point

1007
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:22,459
all four three

1008
00:45:22,459 --> 00:45:26,579
political party affiliation

1009
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:28,949
take those figures

1010
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:29,869
plug them in

1011
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:31,549
to home

1012
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:34,719
applaud him into before it was

1013
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:36,799
some genetic contribution

1014
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:42,679
to variance there's something genetic about
whether you're liberal or conservative

1015
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:48,859
but again but not a shared environment is
more powerful then they shared environment

1016
00:45:48,859 --> 00:45:50,300
and at work that way

1017
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,979
all the way down with the exception of education

1018
00:45:52,979 --> 00:45:54,869
shared environments really important

1019
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:58,769
thought god determinant of of education

1020
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:00,369
parents usually say

1021
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:04,769
you're going to college and you are going
to college too

1022
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:06,639
uh... that's the sheraton bar

1023
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,040
parents hardly ever say

1024
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:13,109
ball you go to college and go to hell or whatever
it is

1025
00:46:13,109 --> 00:46:15,869
not what usually are happens

1026
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:17,149
but again

1027
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:20,129
the idea here is

1028
00:46:20,129 --> 00:46:21,289
when we look at

1029
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:23,799
what determines behavior

1030
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:25,840
jeans environment

1031
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,800
what aspect of the environment

1032
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,130
what aspect of the holiday in iraq it turns
out

1033
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,990
but there is a significant

1034
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,360
genetic component

1035
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,339
to individual differences in personality

1036
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:39,709
and in attitudes

1037
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:44,759
but there is a also is significant environmental
problems

1038
00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:51,259
and that is so important typically as to dominate
the shared environment component it's not

1039
00:46:51,259 --> 00:46:56,339
the environment within the family that makes
people what they are it's the environment

1040
00:46:56,339 --> 00:47:01,159
outside the family that makes people all of
what they are

1041
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:02,419
in most cases

1042
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:05,119
the power of the nine shared environment

1043
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,119
matches

1044
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,779
or exceeds the power

1045
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:10,750
the genetic code contributor

1046
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,669
and personnel

1047
00:47:12,669 --> 00:47:14,809
for now the question is

1048
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:16,450
how to make sense of this

1049
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,819
how to make sense the fact that

1050
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:24,619
their genetic contributions to individual
differences in personality and attitudes

1051
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:30,049
non shared barman is much more important then
the shared in part

1052
00:47:30,049 --> 00:47:34,809
the encik which will elect and on on wednesday
is basically

1053
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:36,980
on simple what we want to know

1054
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,150
why it is

1055
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:43,200
that children from the same family are so
different from each other

1056
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,279
why is that they'd even identical twins or
is different from each other home as they

1057
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:49,219
are

1058
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:51,900
each child has a different genetic heritage

1059
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,899
okay

1060
00:47:52,899 --> 00:47:59,299
but it turns out that the family environment
is not decisive for personality and attitudes

1061
00:47:59,299 --> 00:48:00,299
being raised

1062
00:48:00,299 --> 00:48:02,599
by the parents that you were raised by

1063
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:04,430
in the house that you were raised in

1064
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,400
is not what makes you or what uh...

1065
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,190
of the white you were art there's as much
variability within families

1066
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:19,190
on one brothers and sisters almost as much
variability between families as there is variability

1067
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,779
between families

1068
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:22,539
the reason for this is

1069
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:26,999
the idea that children are written are raised
in

1070
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:31,329
the same for and children a family are raised
in the same family is true for the point of

1071
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:33,579
view of the kids eat codes

1072
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:34,959
and telephone numbers

1073
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:41,669
but turns out not to be psychologically troop
it turns out that there are all sorts of

1074
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,229
dipole sorts of

1075
00:48:43,229 --> 00:48:48,279
variances within a family going to talk about
these all last night next time

1076
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:54,459
and lots of variance all part of the variance
outside the family leading to the conclusion

1077
00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:56,059
every

1078
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:58,549
or where are we here

1079
00:48:58,549 --> 00:49:00,849
leading to the conclusion that

1080
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:06,719
saddlery child is raised by different parents

1081
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:09,439
raised in a different household

1082
00:49:09,439 --> 00:49:11,779
worships at a different charge

1083
00:49:11,779 --> 00:49:14,709
attends a different school

1084
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:21,019
that every child is raised andy unique psychological
environment

1085
00:49:21,019 --> 00:49:27,009
and that unique psychological environment
contributes to the uniqueness of his or her

1086
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:29,259
personality

1087
00:49:29,259 --> 00:49:30,650
how i can be

1088
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:31,900
that two kids

1089
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,969
even identical twins

1090
00:49:33,969 --> 00:49:39,410
can be raised by the same parents in the same
house go to the same schools go to the same

1091
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:43,829
churches and end up so different from each
other

1092
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:48,269
is an interesting puzzle for psychology and
all talk more about it

1093
00:49:48,269 --> 00:49:49,449
next time thank you very much
