1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,369
okay let's continue our discussion of
psychopathology in psychotherapy

2
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:14,329
but before we do that

3
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:18,359
but a reminder that next week next
thursday we have the final examination

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,710
in this course

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,089
going to be thursday morning we don't
know where you had

6
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,670
i don't know where yet somebody may know
where's yet but i don't

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,949
but it doesn't matter

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,009
or it could be here it could be at the
uh... basketball arena that's where

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,859
we've had these exams before

10
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:38,050
all get that'd information to you just
as soon as i get it

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,020
all

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,490
do you have reviews that i've been
thrust into the website that was an

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,550
experiment this year that's worked out
so well i'm going to do it for the final

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,760
as well

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,200
so we'll have that most of the course
website by friday that's plenty of time

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,170
offer your studying i think i know all
the students who have are disability

17
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,239
accommodations now

18
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,199
if i don't

19
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,700
gotta get that to be pretty fast

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:06,080
on and will have the same arrangements
as usual for alone for the exam

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,450
just a couple more details about the
exam river it sooner to part format

22
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,670
there is a non killed a portion of the
exam that will cover all the materials

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,299
since the last all goat since last
midterm

24
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,540
chuck lectures and chapters on
psychological development

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,600
lectures and chapters on the stand
psychopathology in psychotherapy but

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,270
also will have a couple of questions
drawn from the appendix on statistics

27
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,330
on that document portions would be
exactly thirty six items no more no less

28
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,190
all along

29
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,170
speculative portion will be the
remaining sixty four items

30
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,390
covering the whole shamir

31
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,960
beginning onto to end

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,049
so i will be exam will be a hundred
mobile choice

33
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:51,590
questions that's double the size of our
day after the midterm so three hour exam

34
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,170
you have plenty of time ought to
complete the exam

35
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,340
on usual roughly half drawn directly
from the lectures roughly half drawn

36
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,180
directly

37
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,000
or from the text

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,990
armed

39
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,990
and make sure when you come from
wherever we're going to have the exam

40
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,119
make sure that you come with the proper
red scantron form

41
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:10,829
okay

42
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:14,009
we are not the improper read one or the
green one book

43
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,559
the right one

44
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,720
alms and uh...

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,939
to be cured that is just haven't filled
out

46
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:23,359
with identifying information beforehand

47
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:26,830
all a couple of other deadlines are
discussion sections

48
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,279
although continue through monday the
last day of class next week

49
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:36,189
this weekend next in discussion section
you'll be doing course evaluations

50
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:40,150
all get the discussion section grades
posted by tuesday

51
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,319
all of the eleventh of all

52
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,790
of uh... december

53
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,459
if are there are any

54
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:46,260
errors

55
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,040
shall we call them errors all of them
discussion section graves

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,329
you need to contact you're geoscience
very quickly

57
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,740
palm of for this

58
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,669
and request of request reconsideration

59
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:00,410
the reason we usually do with

60
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,990
one-week deadlines for these kinds of
things at berkeley finals the final

61
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,889
grades are due within ninety six hours
of the final exam

62
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,400
so of there just isn't enough time

63
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,659
to give people weekdays correct things
on and so on

64
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,329
so uh... all

65
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,659
check your role

66
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,390
check your section great in the course
website

67
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,789
sometime after monday and uh... there's
any issue

68
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,719
pick up your g aside before

69
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,659
too soon

70
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:33,430
or p pieper dissipation that's going to
be completed by next monday the ten th

71
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,860
and make sure when you've finished your
are p_p_ purchase a patient

72
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,199
that you would find your credits dislike
one

73
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,949
because what happens at the end of the

74
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:46,329
allowed at the end of the semester i'd
get the download our roster for this

75
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:51,069
class the shows all the r p p credits
that have been assigned to this class by

76
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,769
the students in the class

77
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:54,180
if you haven't

78
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,779
assigned your credits

79
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:59,769
i don't know what they are okay i have
no way of doing that

80
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:02,430
are consult the or keep you blue sheet

81
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,270
for good instructions

82
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,209
but make sure you assign your credits

83
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,969
to uh... looks like one

84
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:12,989
any quick questions about the are

85
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:19,989
final exam business

86
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,339
last time we were discussing the origins
of

87
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:28,639
mental illness but question of the
f_b_i_ logy of mental illness

88
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,909
and i set out a time framework for
understanding

89
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:34,759
hire people get

90
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,149
become mentally ill

91
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,550
known as the died after so stress

92
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,250
framework

93
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,490
and basically the idea is

94
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,139
that there are two

95
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,119
factors

96
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:47,100
that are important in causing

97
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,640
mental illness to occur

98
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,169
neither one of which is sufficient

99
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:54,340
four all of them for mental illness

100
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,599
but the two of them have to interrupt
altogether

101
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:01,150
in a way that's similar to all
directions that we've seen

102
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,110
the first of these is that i got a
suspect or

103
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,270
which is some characteristic of the
individual something that the individual

104
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,929
carries with him or her

105
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:14,790
on could be genetic and could be more
moral it could be constitutional

106
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,180
it could be called it the could be a
promotional the could be anything but

107
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,800
it's a more or less stable
characteristic of the individual

108
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,529
that predisposes is him or her to sign
the particular formal of mental on

109
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:28,229
illness

110
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,099
leaves the person habitable

111
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:33,210
to some form of mental illness believes
a person

112
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,789
at risk

113
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:39,339
are despite a slight episode so the
ideas are people adapt to whatever the

114
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,470
study offices factories they make a
relatively good a relatively poor

115
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,020
are adaptation

116
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,060
but an episode of mental illness

117
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,770
does in a car are less that person's
current level of adaptation is

118
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,319
challenged

119
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,640
by some

120
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,860
knew of that

121
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,819
this is the stress component in the diet
offices stress model

122
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:01,990
so the idea is your venerable or
something

123
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,450
then something happens

124
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,319
that precipitates or an acute episode of
mental illness

125
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,729
but the stress doesn't cause mental
illness and everybody

126
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:14,019
it all neeku causes the mental illness

127
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:20,279
people who are carrying our particular
predisposition or die offices factor

128
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,979
and last time i gave you a number are
the examples of

129
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,110
right out of the death as the stress
model on inaction

130
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,379
time-dependent show you how are how it
worked

131
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,729
i won't go over all of that all mel but
just to review

132
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,759
all remember that poor schizophrenia

133
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,289
and for you in a poor after

134
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:45,669
to distort so-called major depressive
illness we know that there is a genetic

135
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:49,740
component to these illnesses we know
that because

136
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,440
model psychotic twins all show higher
concordance rates for these mental

137
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,879
illnesses then dies i got a twins do

138
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,810
that's prima session evidence for a

139
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,579
genetic or inherited component in these
two forms of mental illness

140
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:09,759
d concordance rate for schizophrenic and
for major affect a disorder

141
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,810
is fat less than a perfect one hundred
percent

142
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,679
by the logic of behavior genetic studies

143
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:21,569
that means that there is also important
billions in schizophrenia

144
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:25,970
an important variance in a yuna polar
depressive disorder

145
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,929
that's contributed by the

146
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,699
now i'm sure impairment

147
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,449
okay

148
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:36,260
so you've got in these behavior genetic
studies of schizophrenia and audit

149
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,020
beautiful or affect of disorder evidence
for both a genetic diagnosis

150
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,340
there's some genetic predisposition

151
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,479
just as a friend here and two major
press of illness

152
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,430
but you ought also very clear

153
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,589
that that genetic determination is not
decisive

154
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:55,559
it's not decisive because are if one
twin

155
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,740
has schizophrenia

156
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,210
there's only about forty fifty percent
chance that the other twin will have

157
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,109
schizophrenia

158
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:02,580
something the differentiates them

159
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,129
that something is in the not shared
environment and that seems to of reflect

160
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:09,749
the stress factor

161
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:14,210
then continuing wall with those studies
from the heart of the actual castings

162
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:14,759
group

163
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,430
we thought that you and all

164
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,780
adolescent conduct disorder on major
formal personality disorder that affects

165
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,949
on adolescence and and young adults

166
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:28,080
we saw that all

167
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,349
levels of enable any activity

168
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:34,019
fault seem to be a dot at the suspect ur

169
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:36,029
and a history of maltreatment

170
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:37,770
seems to be ustrust

171
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,259
factor

172
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,380
so it's a particular combination

173
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,090
on enable eighty activity

174
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,440
and maltreatment

175
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,620
seems to lying at the heart of
adolescent conduct disorder

176
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,040
or if you're carrying particular form of
the m_ a_ l_ a_ gene

177
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,660
but you're not exposed

178
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,100
to also on long history of maltreatment

179
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,410
you don't get adolescent conduct
disorder released about more likely to

180
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,139
get it

181
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:05,730
then dog then somebody selected at
random

182
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,550
it's the dialysis and the stress in
combination

183
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,970
similarly another study from cast these
group of depression on depression

184
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,800
looked at another gmail known as the
five h_t_t_p_ gina never could

185
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,850
but geneticist provocative

186
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,180
cockamamie names right you will have to
worry about

187
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,680
where they come from

188
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,429
all

189
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:30,089
and there are two different wheels of
this gene mall at short and long you get

190
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:31,920
one from each year parents

191
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,450
on it turns out that if you've got one
of the three short versions of the five

192
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,800
h_t_t_p_ lol allyl

193
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,390
combined

194
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,980
with a history of lots of stress

195
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,920
then it's that combination

196
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,110
of the genetic diagnosis

197
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,880
and at the stress in your life

198
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,780
that is likely to precipitate an episode
of depression

199
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,879
and similarly there was a study by
foxtons nathan fox of his colleagues

200
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,890
on pathological shyness

201
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:02,370
not ordinary garden variety shyness
we're talking about serious pathological

202
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,450
shyness

203
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,480
here

204
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,959
again

205
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,740
the short only on the five h_d_t_v_ gene
is implicated as a dialysis factor

206
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,930
social support

207
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,959
for the individual among family of the
family and friends is the or

208
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,879
is the environmental factor here

209
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,490
and it's the combination

210
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:26,580
of the genetic predisposition with the
environmental factor all low levels of

211
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,529
social support

212
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:28,990
that seems to me

213
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,729
the pathological shyness these are all
examples of how

214
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:36,060
some kind of genetic

215
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,700
dialysis will leave a person vital to
some form of mental illness

216
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,950
and then some specific stress or

217
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,089
will

218
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:47,329
combine with that genetic play out this
is

219
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:52,699
to precipitate a particular episode one
thing i want you to notice here is how

220
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:53,699
specific this is

221
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:57,689
it's not that there is a jeans somewhere
that says we're going to get mentally

222
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,100
ill

223
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,910
itself

224
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,530
and they may gene that seems to be
involved in adolescent conduct disorder

225
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,830
but doesn't seem to be involved in
depression

226
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,699
it's the five dekhti thi gene

227
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:12,640
that seems to be involved in depression
but doesn't have anything to do

228
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,990
with adolescent conduct disorder
moreover even stressor factors or more

229
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,749
of a specific tune with a particular

230
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:24,160
all before the mental illness we're
talking about

231
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,779
it's a history of maltreatment

232
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:28,549
that is critical for adolescent conduct
disorder

233
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:32,939
not stressful dot gov of the amount of
stress in the person's life or the

234
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:37,110
amount of social support is the amount
of stress and the person's life

235
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,379
that is critical for depression

236
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,870
not the history of maltreatment or not
the level of social support

237
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,460
so it's not as if there's some funny
jeans somewhere that leads to mental

238
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,009
illness

239
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,209
or some

240
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,670
gendron eric factor in the environment

241
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,360
that precipitates the of episode

242
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,739
the dialysis and stress factors involved
in use different form of mental illness

243
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:02,220
appeared to be different

244
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,280
here are two more examples

245
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,900
where we seem to have evidence for a
biological play out the cis

246
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,780
interacting with environmental stress to
lead to particular forms of mental atlas

247
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,030
this one is a favorite of mine
psychosomatic ulcers

248
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,900
are there are people who get also
resolved regions in the of pollen in the

249
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,260
young gastrointestinal lining

250
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,330
all there's a lot all history all belong

251
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,179
of all psychosomatic medicine

252
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:33,429
that attributed these of or that these
ulcers

253
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:35,260
to stress

254
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:40,540
stress as you know from chapter three of
glickman not to mention or earlier

255
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,350
lecture

256
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,689
stress stimulates the secretion of acid
into the stomach lining

257
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:48,709
if a lot of that as it gets into the
stomach ache and eat away as the stomach

258
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,900
lining and callers on called cause it
all sort

259
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,350
but about twenty years ago now a group
of australia medical researchers

260
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,819
discovered that there was a particular
bacterial infection h_ pylori by this is

261
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:01,880
what it looks like

262
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,559
a particular apartheid

263
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,489
that is found in the d

264
00:13:05,489 --> 00:13:10,709
uh... within the intestinal tracts of
people with all serbs and that led them

265
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,819
these guys won the nobel prize for
medicine ought it was last year waited

266
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:16,860
long enough they finally got it

267
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,640
all

268
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,779
well for them for the for this discovery

269
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,980
which at the time seem to overthrow

270
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,399
the idea that stress was involved in
authors

271
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,509
and to suggest that there was a purely

272
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:30,790
or biological cause of ulcers

273
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,240
that won't which was infection by each
of apollo right

274
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,410
but it turns out make up for a long
story short

275
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,750
you can find this bargain in about
eighty eighty five percent of people who

276
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,360
have all sorts

277
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,600
but the dirty secret is you can also
find the spoken about eighty or eighty

278
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,320
five percent of people who don't have
all sorts

279
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,930
so it but the bacterial infection is not
been itself

280
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,720
because of all services

281
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,980
it turns out we now have a good evidence
from laboratory studies

282
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,309
all of this bacterial infection all into
racks

283
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:07,940
with environmental stresses of various
kinds especially prolonged

284
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,260
emotional stress

285
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,989
leading to prolong the activation of the
autonomic nervous system

286
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:14,449
and it's

287
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:15,190
accommodation

288
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,740
although h_ pylori infection plus

289
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,640
pro-life environmental stress that leads
to or the development of ulcers

290
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,850
or at least orthonormal a little rat
model laboratories

291
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,610
and as well as we can tell

292
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,760
you know

293
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,610
you know in rats as well so here's one
more example and i'm going to give you

294
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,369
one more example

295
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:40,730
of died at the system stress little old
that different in character

296
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,010
enough

297
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:47,720
we usually think about phobias as fear
reactions that are accounted for by some

298
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,860
kind of learning experience

299
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,600
you go over the world you have some kind
of

300
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,280
although

301
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,540
terrible experience in some situation

302
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,829
and then you find yourself with an on
the reasonable unwarranted fear of that

303
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,290
situation

304
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:07,020
that part classical conditioning model
of obvious but very popular for about

305
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,870
fifty years on now

306
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,000
all day and it turns out that that's a
pretty good of account of of other of

307
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,030
the phobias

308
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,309
with one exception

309
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,360
and now it is

310
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,670
epic kinds of phobias that we meet opera
with in the clinic

311
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,000
or not

312
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,950
representative of all the situations

313
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,700
that or scary

314
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,460
all when the hall but when we cease all
phobic patients in the clinic

315
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,569
we don't find that they have

316
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:34,480
phobias about heights

317
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,340
they have for the is about closed spaces

318
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,730
they have phobias about being in the
presence of other people and especially

319
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,029
ball being watched

320
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:46,040
really makes you nervous to be watched
sometimes we got the social phobia

321
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,820
all they have four beers about various
kinds of animals but it's not usually

322
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,210
dogs and cats the people have will be
used for

323
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:53,660
snakes

324
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,830
and spiders

325
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,660
and other things that

326
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,170
don't have much about

327
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,599
alm basically

328
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,379
so the idea here is

329
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,470
that the phobias that we have though
that the object so we have for this for

330
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,090
are not arbitrary set of the objects
that we could also

331
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,980
moreover a lot of people have things
like snake phobias have actually never

332
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,990
had a bad uncomfortable to sneak to do a
detailed history have you ever been

333
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,199
bitten by a stick

334
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:21,720
hall

335
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,420
had never been surprised by snake

336
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,230
no every conceivable state

337
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,249
gold enough but still they have that
they will have his pathological for your

338
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:31,840
of of snakes

339
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,020
and when you trace it back it turns out
that that there's been some wild

340
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,510
encounters someplace nothing that would
seem sufficient

341
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,290
to trigger before being

342
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,510
martin seligman

343
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,070
all right and his colleagues came up
with all with an interesting idea

344
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:53,080
what happens is we are prepared by the
brochure lol revolution

345
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:59,400
to acquire a strong fear reactions to a
certain classes of stimuli okay

346
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,340
demand but in the air with very little
slower with with very little support

347
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,990
biederman close places even dark places

348
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,919
been in the presence of squiggly little
animals without legs that run close to

349
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,209
the ground

350
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,630
all of those cuts of things

351
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,780
and dot you can think about that
evolutionary preparedness

352
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,240
of for your response

353
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,980
as having some of the same kinds of
functions aphrodite offices

354
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,520
if you've got that's almond

355
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,000
evolutionarily prepared

356
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,670
predisposition to fear

357
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,049
just a smallest encounter

358
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:34,650
arms are with the above with the object
may be enough

359
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,059
to trigger the development

360
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,190
of a very severe

361
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:43,369
or for your or reaction susan my neck
out now what northwestern university

362
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:47,960
actually showed all of the of the show
the importance of conditioning

363
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,150
or a lot of preparedness

364
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,740
in a series of classic studies that you
did some years ago now

365
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,100
on of the acquisition of snake phobias
in rhesus monkeys this is the laboratory

366
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,740
model

367
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,550
all four all for total bs in humans it
turns out that rhesus monkeys who are

368
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,360
born and raised in the wild

369
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,420
or or free of snakes

370
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,070
every one of them

371
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,050
they're just afraid of sex

372
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:15,280
all and that has usually been
interpreted as a are

373
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,270
as a prewar yard

374
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,020
innate

375
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,500
reflexive fear which as you can imagine
if you're a little rhesus monkeys live

376
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,750
in the jungle all you want to avoid boa
constrictor zand cobras and dole and and

377
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,289
and other kinds of uh... and other kinds
of out of it

378
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,620
it makes sense is just a pre water

379
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,250
after it of your response

380
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,580
the only problem with this is as my
naked noted

381
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
is that

382
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,150
rhesus monkeys that are born under the
laboratory harder for his next

383
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,440
is not afraid of specs help culpa sings
the bekaa effective on c_n_n_ the other

384
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,350
day is good for the boa constrictor

385
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,009
it's like that but then they don't don't
mind

386
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:53,690
on snakes all at at at all

387
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,820
of however

388
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,100
if eight lab raise rear other rhesus
monkey

389
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,679
is exposed to of the deal is exposed to
a snake

390
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,250
then the animal will acquire a snake
local stapled it very quickly

391
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,320
well monica did a very sparse evidence
permits which i bought friend i don't

392
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,250
have time to talk to you about notified
half an hour

393
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,050
ought to do these experiments right

394
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,390
but i've got a very nice account of them
in the uh...

395
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,120
in the uh... lecture supplements

396
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,940
and when she looked at

397
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,360
all

398
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,980
a hollow rhesus monkeys could acquire
eight for your response to stakes

399
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,390
simply by being exposed to another
rhesus monkey that was already afraid of

400
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,539
snakes

401
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:38,890
and then to take a long story short she
arranged this experiment in such a way

402
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:39,580
that

403
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,670
the market was afraid of snakes was
exposed to a snake out of the view of

404
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,950
ladner monkey

405
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,679
all the lab rear monkeys solved was
snake and that the other alarms and the

406
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:53,290
other monkey being afraid

407
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,029
levered monkey didn't have any encounter
with a snake at all

408
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,940
but immediately after being exposed too

409
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,550
the palm

410
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,130
to the weinberger monkey

411
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,269
all of of reacting with fear to the
snake

412
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:09,049
belabored monkey became afraid of snakes

413
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:13,450
that's very interesting just one
exposure ought to go to get this

414
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,750
but in a different on the experiment

415
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,640
all-out sheet arranged by virtue of part
of the television monitors

416
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,280
to show a monkey reacting to a snake

417
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,800
but the test monkey

418
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,860
thought the market was reacting to of
vase of flowers

419
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,090
if we're just a straight up all of the
heart of the acquiring phobias

420
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,850
all through social learning was just a
couple of them straight matteo

421
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,500
seeing somebody

422
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,010
alm

423
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,590
be afraid of the presence of some object
you'd think these animals would become

424
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,740
afraid of or vase of flowers to but they
didn't

425
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,160
they already became afraid

426
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,630
when the monkey

427
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:57,130
though that the model monkey was exposed
to snake or a snake like object

428
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,390
so these animals seem to be

429
00:20:59,390 --> 00:20:59,960
prepared

430
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,860
to become afraid of snakes

431
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,850
but don't be called operators actually
become afraid of snakes unless they were

432
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,519
exposed

433
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,440
to some kind of fear stimulus

434
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,870
but it doesn't work for other kinds of
stimuli it only works

435
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,590
for snakes and snake like stimulant

436
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,220
sojourn the idea here is

437
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,080
is that preparedness

438
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,100
or old friend from our program learning
lectures

439
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,649
is that like a diagnosis off factor for
phobias

440
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:27,470
there isn't a bad predisposition

441
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,970
to be afraid of heights

442
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,110
to be afraid of dark places to be afraid
of enclosed spaces

443
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,520
to be afraid of certain kinds of animals

444
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,370
but we're not naturally afraid of these
kinds of things we just have in napa and

445
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,770
innate disposition

446
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,170
to become afraid

447
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:47,220
when we're going to become afraid in
those various kinds of circumstances

448
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,460
that's when begat

449
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,309
the young

450
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,209
that's when we get the full dick
reaction

451
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,010
okay

452
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,550
schizophrenia

453
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,690
depression

454
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,360
conduct disorder

455
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,759
pathological shyness

456
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,200
also hers

457
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,990
almost and

458
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,929
phobias

459
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:03,530
all

460
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,050
although

461
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,890
conditions all mental illnesses

462
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,020
where we seem to have

463
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,450
a biological died at the cis

464
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,080
that leaves the person or the animal
venerable to psalm form of mental

465
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,950
illness

466
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,989
and and dot biological dialysis

467
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:20,550
interacting

468
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:25,000
with some kind of environmental stress

469
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,890
and that's the way to put up with the
stress theories of mental illness are

470
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,909
usually presented

471
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:32,800
that there is some biological dialysis

472
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,990
and the psalm environmental stress

473
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:41,340
that interactive produce an episode of
of mental illness but it turns out

474
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,230
of the all of the big dialysis factors

475
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,110
are usually biological but they don't
have to be

476
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,230
and the stress factors are usually
environmental or a psychological in

477
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,919
nature but they don't have to be either
so for example

478
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,960
we know that they are logical stress
orders

479
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,799
in the history of many people with
schizophrenia

480
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,580
and those have to do

481
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,020
all of them

482
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,779
prenatal or perinatal complications into
individuals who as adults

483
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:14,420
come down a schizophrenic

484
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,299
have a much

485
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:17,710
stronger history

486
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,250
of prenatal and perinatal of the birth
complications

487
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,429
that goes all the knows who do not

488
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:26,529
these complications are not enough

489
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:29,900
by themselves to cause is a friend a a

490
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,610
but these kinds of biological stress
sores

491
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,610
combined with

492
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,929
the biological predisposition
predisposition to schizophrenia may be

493
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:40,169
enough to trigger

494
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,240
an acute episode

495
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,560
all of the illness

496
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,320
moreover

497
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,789
the stress errors bart these that the
diagnoses are often biological

498
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:51,809
have to be

499
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:53,679
in some forms of depression

500
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,610
we said we seem to our will find

501
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:01,159
that individuals or rendered vulnerable
to some forms of depression

502
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:03,429
by psychological factors

503
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:04,309
not by

504
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,940
oh not by biological ones

505
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,470
the first person to discover this

506
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,480
erin backed him back at the university
of pennsylvania

507
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,679
on won the last earl warren a couple
years ago all four all for this work

508
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,039
that discovered

509
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,400
that individuals who are depressed

510
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,910
seem to share in common

511
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,770
wahl trial that all believes

512
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:33,000
that bob beckel refer to as the press or
genic scope that out

513
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,720
remembers camara are

514
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,440
pre-existing beliefs of expectations
that people have about the world that

515
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,370
terry them around on in their heads

516
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,670
and all the best argued

517
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,679
that

518
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,270
individuals with depression

519
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:52,180
have a cognitive dialysis cognitive
vulnerability

520
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,110
because they have this negative view of
themselves

521
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,480
negative view of the world

522
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,309
as a negative view of the future i'm no
good the world's a bad place in the

523
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:04,539
future socks okay

524
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:08,120
that's the general idea that the general
importance of the beliefs of these

525
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,050
people carry around with them

526
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:15,240
but it's a psychological diatoms as it
doesn't cause the depression

527
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,210
but if somebody who has the

528
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,830
you will of the world

529
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:24,190
that has some unpleasant unhappy
stressful events occur to him or her

530
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,859
what he or she is going to do

531
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,659
all according to beck's theory

532
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:28,699
is to

533
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:30,619
become actively

534
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:32,860
depressed so here you have

535
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,100
a psychological going out this is

536
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,980
in terms of these two presage an extra
models all people

537
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,669
houses negative view of themselves and
the world

538
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:45,670
and when something bad happens

539
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,100
then they become depressed

540
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,630
if you don't have

541
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,190
this negative view of yourself in the
world and something bad happens

542
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,780
you don't get depressed

543
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,279
according to the expiry you might get
angry

544
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,749
you might get determined

545
00:25:57,749 --> 00:25:59,940
but you don't get depressed

546
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:05,210
similarly linnea gruesome learn a lawyer
and their colleagues in a very intent on

547
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,720
backs cognitive theory of depression

548
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,090
argued

549
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,480
people are rendered vulnerable to
depression

550
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,619
by virtue of having a particular style

551
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:21,179
of making attributions about events in
the world a particular style

552
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:25,840
of explaining the events that occur all
ill in their in their world

553
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,309
and this particular traditional style

554
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:30,179
involves making stable

555
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:32,850
internal and global attributions

556
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,740
stable a dutch additions

557
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,030
attributions too

558
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,850
factors that don't change

559
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,960
as opposed to variable

560
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,620
factors to do

561
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,520
internal attributions

562
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,970
attributions div two factors

563
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,080
that are part of the person

564
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,510
as opposed to

565
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,730
part of the world outside

566
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,750
global attributions

567
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:57,200
attributions that apply to all sorts of
events as opposed to

568
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,820
specific attributions

569
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,929
or that applies only to well particular
kinds of ends

570
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:04,549
and the general idea here

571
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:08,040
is that there are people kal believed

572
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,230
he's responsible flare

573
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,110
the things that happen to them
especially the bad things that happen to

574
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,730
them

575
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:20,210
and then when a bad thing does happen to
them that's when they get depressed

576
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,470
if you think

577
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,150
you are always responsible for the bad
things that happen to you

578
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,750
and a bad thing happens do

579
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,960
of course are going to get depressed

580
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,850
but if you think but somebody else is
responsible for the bad things that

581
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,529
happened to you

582
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:38,110
you're not going to get depressed you're
going to get angry or or something else

583
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,980
so the idea here is

584
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,820
but in bex theory

585
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,100
it's a very happy

586
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,630
thinking

587
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,900
peptide that predisposes his people to
develop start of depression

588
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,500
in are abramson diana lawrence theory

589
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,029
it's again

590
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:56,890
me i think you know it's a psychological
vulnerability factor

591
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,630
and then when something negative happens

592
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,520
then all

593
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,740
then the depression

594
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,850
yes bom

595
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,270
with gets precipitate

596
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,970
so here it is another example

597
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:13,280
where you can look at the interaction of
dialysis and stress

598
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,990
factors

599
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:20,510
we know for example that sudden changes
in parmar all endowment

600
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,330
ten trigger an episode of depression

601
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:29,739
changes that occur in the cessation of
pregnancy for example or with childbirth

602
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:31,659
or with entering

603
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:33,349
menopause this is one of the reasons

604
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:35,639
why depression is somewhat more common

605
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:38,880
in women or that it is in in men

606
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,560
we know that these

607
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,410
read that these sudden changes in
biochemical on and on in government in

608
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,380
hormonal endowment

609
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,480
we'll have various kinds of behavioral
consequences

610
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,510
bill alter the person's mood state make
amber or depressed

611
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:59,040
all will lead to reductions of activity
levels all again all lowered activity

612
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,760
levels as one of the non

613
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,850
motion also in terms

614
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,150
of depression

615
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,429
so that i want you to imagine now

616
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:11,409
isn't one of the lowest is if there is
also hormonal changes a biological

617
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:13,049
stress or

618
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:16,020
occurs to somebody who is

619
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,040
carried around in his or her head

620
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,149
baxter presage an extra model

621
00:29:21,149 --> 00:29:22,539
or abramson's

622
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:24,009
onto presage attic

623
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:25,749
action the usual style

624
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:28,789
under those circumstances what they're
going to do

625
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:30,600
is to

626
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,040
interpret

627
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,950
the changes in

628
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,049
event levels and their behavioral
consequences

629
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:37,840
inouye

630
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,139
that may lead to

631
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:42,620
the onset of an episode of depression
okay

632
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,429
so it's a hormonal changes

633
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:47,710
but it's the interpretation of those
changes

634
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,169
in combination

635
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:52,430
that produce the depression all and

636
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,009
depends on

637
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:57,729
how you interpret these changes going to
determine whether you're going to get

638
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:01,900
depressed

639
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,559
just to

640
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,290
review the bidding here for a second

641
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,480
you should recognize by now

642
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,290
but the died out this is stress

643
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:14,560
framework for understanding the origins
of of the origins of mental illness

644
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,039
is a very and

645
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:16,880
on

646
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,179
or old familiar

647
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:22,850
person by situation interaction

648
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,220
dialysis factors

649
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,680
whited out dialogue circle in nature

650
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,600
like genetic

651
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,990
tore psychological in nature

652
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,180
depressive gen x_ camara or depressive
genic attribution all style

653
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,150
these are attributes all of the person

654
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,300
there's their of features

655
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,559
whether they're biological features or
cognitive features that the person

656
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:48,320
carries around are with him or over

657
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,970
it doesn't matter whether there had
their origins in the person's genetic

658
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,050
and almond

659
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,549
or whether they have their origins in
the person's history of social learning

660
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:59,140
they are still

661
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,730
factors that are

662
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,819
internal too

663
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,210
the our person

664
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,740
their bioethicist actors

665
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,620
stress orders are of course

666
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,580
features of the environment

667
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,299
stressors are things that happened to
the individual

668
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:14,309
either happened to the individual

669
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:16,230
by virtue of

670
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,210
something biological

671
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,179
all

672
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,080
terry nichols trust or since qasar
fretting

673
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,290
hormonal changes in some forms of
depression

674
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,770
or date of the stressors or
psycho-social in nature

675
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:34,270
our history of maltreatment or any of
them very very all thought the severe

676
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,500
all loss or whatever

677
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,009
again

678
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:41,000
you've got the interaction of something
about the person

679
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
whether it is

680
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,940
something biological or something
psychological interacting with something

681
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,360
in the environment

682
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,640
whether that is indeed biological
environment or in the psychosocial

683
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,110
environment

684
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:56,440
to precipitate an episode bom bom

685
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,680
to precipitate an episode of gentleness

686
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,169
so that's the diapers the stress
framework for psychopathology

687
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:04,710
let's take a break for a second

688
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,940
and see if you have any questions about
that before we talk about what you do

689
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,580
about mental illness

690
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,790
once you've got it

691
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:17,790
any questions about the diocesan struts
framework

692
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:24,740
what's the difference between the
depressive gen x_ camara are going to be

693
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,670
a traditional styles

694
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,550
they are

695
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:33,870
those are true lol tornado formulations

696
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,060
often what the predisposing cognitive
factor is

697
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,650
in depression they're two different
theories of depression

698
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,480
next

699
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,370
focuses on these negative view of self

700
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:51,110
other and the world those are these
depressive gen x_ d'amato

701
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,130
the abramson and the lori view

702
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:58,190
doesn't act does actually focus on a
negative view of the self

703
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,510
it is a

704
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,510
characteristic away of explaining events
in the world

705
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,780
in terms of stable

706
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,539
internal

707
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:07,559
global factors

708
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:11,050
i'm always responsible for everything

709
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,160
also

710
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,130
that the what what books they read oz is
emphasizes negative view of things

711
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,730
what do you personally welcome
emphasizes is this

712
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,900
tendency to explain events whether
they're positive or negative in a

713
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,770
particular way

714
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,110
in the same way that you could have

715
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:33,519
two different theories of schizophrenia
implicating different neuro transmitters

716
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,499
were two different theories of
depression implicating different kinds

717
00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:40,470
of hormones these are two different
cognitive theories of depression

718
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,840
now interestingly

719
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,170
abramson and all the way were students
of backs

720
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:50,350
okay twelve they weren't direct students
of expert date he was a very important

721
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,959
of or the person in their role

722
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:54,370
calendar in their education

723
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,309
so they but they tend to see

724
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:59,770
back-end abramson in milan deloitte and
to see their theories as complementing

725
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,909
each other just kind of

726
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:03,280
emphasizing different aspects

727
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,970
all this

728
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,629
cognitive vulnerability to depression

729
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,649
with an answer

730
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:17,649
anything else about i doubt the system
stress before i go out

731
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:22,429
the delta some stress framework isn't is
a

732
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,479
detailed accounting

733
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:26,739
for a hollow somebody becomes mentally
ill

734
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:29,699
how an episode of mental illness happens

735
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,229
now let's try to talk about

736
00:34:32,229 --> 00:34:33,850
how we do something

737
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,170
upon an episode of mental illness

738
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,849
once it's occurred

739
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:39,179
and again

740
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,190
aldy

741
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,849
up as the stress framework for the
understanding the origins of mental

742
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:44,969
illness

743
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:48,319
gives us a way of thinking about how to
intervene

744
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,009
to treat mental illness as well

745
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:53,079
so for example

746
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:55,409
unep a sort of mental illness

747
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:59,930
results from the interaction of dialysis
and stress

748
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:04,709
where neither the dialysis nor distress
or are themselves

749
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:06,760
sufficient or by themselves sufficient

750
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,769
for mental illness

751
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:13,649
what you want to do is peter eliminate
or reduce the dialysis

752
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:16,109
or eliminate or reduce

753
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:17,360
the stress or is

754
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,440
and that way

755
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,239
you will

756
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:24,409
of the mental illness okay

757
00:35:24,409 --> 00:35:27,979
humanitarian or reducing the diagnosis
or stress

758
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:30,570
ought to lead to some kind of

759
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,049
cure okay

760
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:37,829
killer understood right as if it writers
in the medical model as eliminating the

761
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:42,310
underlying pathology right that's what a
cure does it eliminates the underlying

762
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,670
on the pathology

763
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,359
it's not enough just to suppress
symptoms

764
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:49,569
in the same way that if you've got a
fever your doctor just doesn't which in

765
00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:51,599
a cold room

766
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,320
okay

767
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,160
gives you an antibiotic to get rid of
the clause of the fever if you've got

768
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,990
the symptoms of schizophrenia or the
scum of the symptoms of depression

769
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:04,549
we don't want to just get your rate
yourself higher on some happy the scale

770
00:36:04,549 --> 00:36:09,910
we want to get you tune no longer have
the barbie underlying pathology

771
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,829
that is causing you to feel or said

772
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:14,739
are completely or

773
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,789
in the dining out this distrust
framework

774
00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:18,439
would probably require

775
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:22,030
doing something about both but i doubt
this is factor

776
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,420
and the stress all factors

777
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,009
now in mentalist

778
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:28,010
we don't have to make yours

779
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:28,949
we've got some

780
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:31,239
but we don't have too many cures

781
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,660
rather in mental illness

782
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,629
at this stage of our knowledge right now

783
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:36,440
mostly

784
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,029
the best we can do is to reduce

785
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:41,249
you live in a

786
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:44,989
various kinds of symptoms that's just
the best we can do

787
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:45,589
error

788
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:47,409
if we can't

789
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:50,070
reduce or eliminate the symptoms of
mental illness

790
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,680
will be trying to do is to teach the
person

791
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,989
two cult as well as possible

792
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:58,069
a chronic

793
00:36:58,069 --> 00:37:02,109
and again that's exactly the same
approach that we take

794
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:03,060
medical illness

795
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,239
if you've got some kind of infection you
go to a doctor

796
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:10,650
he or she will prescribe antibiotics
that'll get britain

797
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,859
all of the infection if you're lucky

798
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:15,800
but there are some come some forms of
illness

799
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,379
that do not admit of that kind of cure

800
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:20,100
diabetes

801
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,989
for example

802
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:24,170
is a chronic met up with medical
condition

803
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,670
our person what ideas

804
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,970
has to watch his or her diet may have to
take injections of insulin or something

805
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,910
else like tat fork the rest of his or
her life

806
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,349
but they preferred ideas

807
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:39,309
the resident cure but there are
treatments

808
00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:41,819
reduce the symptoms of diabetes

809
00:37:41,819 --> 00:37:43,579
and also a local person

810
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:44,470
to cope

811
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:49,660
with this chronic condition same thing
goes in schism in schizophrenia

812
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,190
depression

813
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,760
any other form of men of of mental
illness

814
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,379
if you can cure it

815
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:55,109
correct

816
00:37:55,109 --> 00:38:00,190
if you can't apply treatment that is
known to reduce the symptoms

817
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:00,710
and

818
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,319
help the person to cope as well as
possible

819
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:07,739
or what's going to be a chronic
condition you're going to see those

820
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:08,740
three themes

821
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,799
if you can cure it

822
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:11,999
if you can't

823
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:14,729
at least address the symptoms

824
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:15,649
help the person

825
00:38:15,649 --> 00:38:16,940
to cope better

826
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,310
on in the rest of electric today

827
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,659
and on wednesday

828
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:24,509
wasn't always the case

829
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:27,969
treatment for mental illness has buried
for a long time

830
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:28,609
all

831
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:30,499
or in the eighteen th

832
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:33,589
specially the nineteen th in the early
part of the twentieth century

833
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:35,720
there were no active treatments

834
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,500
for mental illness

835
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,770
instead mentally ill we were more or
less what hollows

836
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,380
in large mental hospitals

837
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:44,970
alm

838
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,200
home

839
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,549
classically called insane asylums
whittled called on those anymore but the

840
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:51,470
world would call the mental hospitals

841
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,790
but there were places

842
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:53,670
where the

843
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,369
all mentally ill

844
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:56,649
people with

845
00:38:56,649 --> 00:38:59,619
severe mental illnesses schism franny al

846
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:01,190
depression and so on

847
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:04,259
work kept away from the rest of society

848
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:07,359
in an environment where they could be
cared for

849
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,260
watched

850
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,630
protected prevented from harming
themselves or or

851
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,100
role or other people but until

852
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,930
well after world war two

853
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:21,180
there were no really good active
treatment for mental illness treatments

854
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:25,589
that even tried to approach radio acya
work

855
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:26,379
alm

856
00:39:26,379 --> 00:39:29,140
in the early part of the twentieth
century

857
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:33,640
all we began to experiment with various
forums on psychotherapy which were

858
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,859
intended to

859
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:36,999
contract

860
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,920
hard to help the person cope

861
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,469
with various kinds of of psychological
deficits okay

862
00:39:43,469 --> 00:39:44,029
psychotherapy

863
00:39:44,029 --> 00:39:49,099
it's a psychological treatment that is
but that is really trying to attack

864
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:52,359
mental function right to get a person i
think better

865
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:56,440
to have more appropriate emotional
reactions to have more appropriate to

866
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,109
rise in gold

867
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:59,079
walls and door and so on

868
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:02,740
and then after world war two getting in
the nineteen fifties

869
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:08,680
we begin to get the advent of a set of
biological therapies mostly in the form

870
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,079
of drugs

871
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,140
that are intended to of cr correct or
act on in some way

872
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,759
the presumed biological substrates

873
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:20,069
of various kinds of mental illness

874
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:23,459
and especially beginning in the
mid-nineteen fifties and continuing

875
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:24,890
today

876
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:25,820
witnessed what

877
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,609
can only thought of as a pharmaceutical
revolution

878
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:31,710
in the treatment of mental illness

879
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,480
a proliferation

880
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,369
of more

881
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:36,420
or less specific drugs

882
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,469
better intended

883
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:38,489
to attack

884
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:42,640
oh more or less specific forms of oil

885
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,780
moralist specific forms of mental
illness let's look at what some of those

886
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,589
drugs

887
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:48,199
are

888
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:51,880
first we have a large number of drug
treatments

889
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,069
federal employees

890
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:56,539
in the treatment of all of our
schizophrenic

891
00:40:56,539 --> 00:41:00,649
most of these are so-called
anti-psychotic medications

892
00:41:00,649 --> 00:41:06,049
where's psychosis is a euphemism here
four zero four of the for schizophrenia

893
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:11,390
all attendees mostly take the form of
major or minor tranquilizers

894
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:15,690
now if you don't have to memorize all
the names of these drugs

895
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,169
these are drugs that you will encounter
in your reading

896
00:41:19,169 --> 00:41:24,109
you know encounter on t_v_ elsie ads for
suffered for firm firm for many of these

897
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:25,280
kinds of drugs

898
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,999
and these are drugs that are

899
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:31,289
use for the treatment of a wide variety
of total missus but they are especially

900
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,539
prominent in the treatment phone call

901
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:36,290
in the treatment of schizophrenia okay

902
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,190
authority scene

903
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,339
mela role

904
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:44,950
held all or close a real alarmed and and
and so on on these are all essentially

905
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:45,529
tranquilizers

906
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:48,910
that act to sedate or the person

907
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,990
and most of them do this

908
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,260
all by

909
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,000
acting upon the nor transmitter system

910
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,159
to reduce levels of dopamine

911
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:58,880
theo

912
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,459
alone in the in the brain

913
00:42:00,459 --> 00:42:04,899
for the dopamine hypothesis of
schizophrenia schizophrenia recalled

914
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:08,509
symptoms of schizophrenia reflected
excess levels of dopamine

915
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:09,560
it's interesting

916
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,860
that the feet of buyers names and all
other

917
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,929
on drug treatment for schizophrenia

918
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:19,479
seemed to enact specifically on the
dopamine uh... system

919
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:23,719
similarly we have large number of drug
treatments available now for the

920
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:25,200
treatment all of major

921
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,829
on or the depressive disorders

922
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:31,090
on the first of these to call them to
all come into play

923
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:36,350
were known as try cyclic antidepressants
just about piece of drug or or the

924
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,349
terminology

925
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:41,769
but i don't senate one you'll see
references to these are you reading

926
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:44,349
which increased levels of nora prepare
for it

927
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:46,059
and serotonin

928
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:48,760
remember the north board motto a mean

929
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,220
hypothesis of depression

930
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,040
that depression reflects abnormally low
levels of nor epinephrine and serotonin

931
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,989
it's interesting

932
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:01,839
that these affective drug treatment for
schizophrenia act to intrigues

933
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,200
just those neuro transmitters

934
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,309
nor epinephrine and on

935
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:07,689
and serotonin

936
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:11,890
okay here's another group of drug
treatment for schizophrenia known as the

937
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:15,069
m_e_l_ inhibitors like nor gil and
parwnation

938
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:18,850
we know that there may also deactivate

939
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,609
weapon effort in serotonin

940
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:22,770
what you're depressed you don't want
anything

941
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:27,020
d activating your levels of nor up in
our friend and serotonin so these and

942
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,489
they are going to have bidders

943
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:30,969
inhabit the activity

944
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:32,380
of the nato

945
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,570
affectively

946
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,810
increasing levels of north and her
friend and serotonin in the uh... in the

947
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:38,360
brain

948
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,920
and that most recently we have this new
class of drugs

949
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,559
known as the selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors the as i saw arise

950
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,369
there all the rage now

951
00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:52,259
prozac zoloft axle three good examples
of them

952
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:53,500
and the day

953
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,680
specifically act

954
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:59,220
as their name implies this specifically
act on serotonin

955
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,960
don't have any affect

956
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,729
on nor epinephrine

957
00:44:02,729 --> 00:44:06,089
these drugs can be a very effective

958
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:07,440
for the treatment

959
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,049
of all of depression

960
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:10,270
very very effective

961
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,680
and interestingly

962
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,209
these all of these affective drugs

963
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:15,309
have

964
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:21,039
a fax on the nervous system that are
consistent with the prevailing

965
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,289
biochemical

966
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:23,910
of uh... of depression

967
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,410
on these drugs all work

968
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,500
either in the north and efren

969
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,790
on north africa

970
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,240
or answering tone in

971
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,319
or on both

972
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,759
finally one other problem other example
drug treatment for anxiety disorder

973
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:38,929
of a large number of drugs

974
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:41,070
on available since the nineteen fifties

975
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:43,390
that are good for the treatment of
anxiety disorder

976
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:47,070
so these are very old like bill tone and
on the back window

977
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,190
orders or little bit on of more recent

978
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,499
michael of the peace corps

979
00:44:52,499 --> 00:44:53,200
that x

980
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,369
and so on

981
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:56,820
these are all mostly

982
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,749
sedative drugs

983
00:44:58,749 --> 00:45:00,170
or barbiturates

984
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,400
spends about two things

985
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,289
they'd all actions to date the nervous
system

986
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:06,970
and again one way of thinking about
anxiety

987
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:07,739
is that

988
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:11,320
the auditors on over arousal of the
nervous system

989
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,259
what these are drugs will do

990
00:45:13,259 --> 00:45:15,619
is to is to come

991
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:18,659
the nervously the nervous system down

992
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:19,640
so i get

993
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,890
for schizophrenia

994
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:24,539
for major depressive disorder

995
00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:29,379
for anxiety disorder and for other cup
forms of anxiety disorder like panic

996
00:45:29,379 --> 00:45:30,609
disorder as well

997
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:32,730
the pharmaceutical revolution

998
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,540
has produced

999
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,750
a large number of drugs

1000
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,000
that seemed to be affected

1001
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,569
in the sense that

1002
00:45:40,569 --> 00:45:41,769
dave reduce

1003
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:42,760
or eliminate

1004
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,019
the symptoms of various forums of mental
illness

1005
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:48,479
they provide symptom relief

1006
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,809
and they also permit individuals

1007
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:53,280
in an earlier age

1008
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,200
would have been hospital hospitalized

1009
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,769
move out of

1010
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:00,950
institutions for the treatment of mental
of the mentally ill

1011
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,420
back into their communities

1012
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,509
and back with their families

1013
00:46:04,509 --> 00:46:06,559
this pharmaceutical revolution

1014
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:07,640
has been

1015
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,600
buried very very important

1016
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:14,189
and very very effective bme that respect
for at least

1017
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:19,160
and again one thing i want to point out
here

1018
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,390
these drugs seem to have specific
affects

1019
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:26,699
in the treatment of specific forms of
mental illness

1020
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:29,369
we have one had

1021
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,380
theories biological theories of
schizophrenia

1022
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,009
of depression an anxiety disorder

1023
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:37,959
implicate the role of the nervous system

1024
00:46:37,959 --> 00:46:43,359
and especially implicate the role of
various neuro transmitters

1025
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,199
lo and behold defeat uprisings

1026
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:49,739
which are very effective in the
treatment of schizophrenia act on the

1027
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:52,390
timing system which theoretically

1028
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:53,530
is that the wrote

1029
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:54,979
of schizophrenia

1030
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,210
the tricyclic antidepressants

1031
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,779
which are very useful in the treatment
of depression

1032
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:05,079
are act on amato amy no transmitters

1033
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:06,049
levels of which

1034
00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:07,309
are all

1035
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:09,879
are implicated in the cause of
depression

1036
00:47:09,879 --> 00:47:13,919
the benzo die as a games which are
affective in the treatment of anxiety

1037
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,520
disorder

1038
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,750
seem to work on another stall the the
returns that are known as gaveled on

1039
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,629
which again

1040
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:25,889
over activity of gabba has been of
thought to be a biological cause of

1041
00:47:25,889 --> 00:47:27,169
anxiety disorder

1042
00:47:27,169 --> 00:47:29,829
so at least in theory

1043
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:32,509
these specific treatments

1044
00:47:32,509 --> 00:47:33,650
attack

1045
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,610
presume to biological basis all of these
specific

1046
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:39,319
disorders

1047
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:40,640
where we have

1048
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,760
pretty good byob bring pretty good
understanding of the underlying

1049
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,080
biological deficit in schizophrenia

1050
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,799
in depression and in exile disorder

1051
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:51,869
these drugs seem to specifically

1052
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:52,890
go after

1053
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:54,969
those trying to affect

1054
00:47:54,969 --> 00:47:56,839
however

1055
00:47:56,839 --> 00:47:59,539
there are some problems

1056
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:05,059
the reliance on the pharmaceutical
treatments although in the treatment of

1057
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:06,029
mental illness

1058
00:48:06,029 --> 00:48:07,979
the first is

1059
00:48:07,979 --> 00:48:11,519
are powerful psychoactive drugs

1060
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,990
each of which has unpleasant or on
desirable side-effects

1061
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:18,069
various ways

1062
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:20,529
although you know anti-psychotic
medications

1063
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:21,799
can often produced

1064
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:25,820
tremors of that resemble the symptoms of
parkinson's disease

1065
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,770
they can produce all sorts of other
movement disorders

1066
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,139
lots of annoying

1067
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:32,719
or or the side effects

1068
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:33,960
these drugs

1069
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:39,140
which are in truth affected in the
treatment of certain kinds of symptoms

1070
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,690
can cause no symptoms to appear

1071
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,159
and that's not

1072
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:44,780
kind of drug

1073
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,840
uh... to have what you really like to
have

1074
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,540
is a drug that'll attack

1075
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:53,200
various kinds of symptoms or underlying
pathology without creating problems all

1076
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,869
for the person

1077
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:55,829
similarly

1078
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:57,110
there it is

1079
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:57,619
payton

1080
00:48:57,619 --> 00:48:59,379
take in some cases

1081
00:48:59,379 --> 00:49:04,089
lack of specificity in be affects of
these drugs

1082
00:49:04,089 --> 00:49:08,210
the selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors

1083
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:10,789
which would theoretically be appropriate

1084
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:12,779
for the treatment of depression

1085
00:49:12,779 --> 00:49:17,589
because we think depression involves
abnormally low levels of serotonin

1086
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:18,700
also turn out

1087
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,699
to be effective in the treatment of
anxiety disorder

1088
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:22,769
which doesn't

1089
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:28,139
as far as we know involved abnormally
low levels of serotonin

1090
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:32,539
it'd in addition to the practical
problems created by the side effects of

1091
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:34,400
some of these substances

1092
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,420
there is a theoretical problem

1093
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:39,720
that sometimes you've got a drug like a
necesario right

1094
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,729
that's good

1095
00:49:40,729 --> 00:49:44,280
for a condition that if the radically
ought to be good for

1096
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:44,859
depression

1097
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:48,989
but is also good for a condition like
anxiety

1098
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,019
but it shouldn't

1099
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:53,709
the so good for so we don't know what's
going on here

1100
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:54,589
fireflame

1101
00:49:54,589 --> 00:50:00,259
these drugs although very affective in
the treatment of

1102
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:00,969
symptoms

1103
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:03,410
do not by any means

1104
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:06,469
resulting in any case for for the
illness

1105
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:09,089
we know that because when patients

1106
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:14,359
going after medication they very
frequently experience a relapse sold the

1107
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:17,319
drug works only so long as it's being
taken

1108
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:19,459
it's not like an antibiotic

1109
00:50:19,459 --> 00:50:22,359
which have been taken just generated
infection

1110
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:24,949
okay you have to take an antibiotic for
life

1111
00:50:24,949 --> 00:50:26,159
most cases

1112
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:28,020
these art of these treatments

1113
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,120
have to be taken chronically

1114
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,829
if they're going to be called if they're
going to be affected

1115
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:36,999
what we do it under those circumstances

1116
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:37,959
what we do is

1117
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:42,439
we turn to the other side of the
treatment equation we turn to

1118
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:43,940
psychosocial interventions

1119
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,170
i bow which i'll talk on wednesday

1120
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:47,599
thank you very much see you wednesday
