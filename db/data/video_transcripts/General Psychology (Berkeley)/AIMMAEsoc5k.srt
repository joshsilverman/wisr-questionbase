1
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,089
okay last time and lecturer we are
intact

2
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:13,680
lou wins

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,470
pseudo formula behavior as a function of
the person and the environment

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,250
and looked at their work various kinds
of relationships that can obtain among

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,859
these three elements

6
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,439
the person's behavior

7
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,229
the person's internal

8
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,149
psychological dispositions

9
00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:35,850
and the features on the external
environment

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,740
and at the end all of the lecture i
described for you

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,990
on

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,190
anyway

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,329
major achievement of traditional
personality psychology

14
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,920
which is to provide a way

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,510
concise framework for summarizing the
individual differences in now in

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,340
personality

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,810
all known as despite factor model of
personality

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,699
her that trace

19
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:06,370
extra version agreeable as consciousness
of notional stability and intellect ins

20
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:12,200
now where the years there has come to be
about the consensus among personalities

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,830
psychologist

22
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,950
that this five factor model many
representative universally applicable

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,400
structural personality

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,370
he has tipped the data is derived mostly
from the north american college students

25
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,890
but it looks as if

26
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,110
this is a um... hum

27
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,960
structure per se that's uncredited
ordinary language

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,760
we use terms like

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,090
extroverted agreeable hands on the moshe
least able to describe each other

30
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,070
and also it's a structure

31
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,219
that appears to be valid across a wide
variety of cultures

32
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:48,979
american culture european culture

33
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,650
asian culture whatever

34
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,190
also appears to be valid across or
different generations my generation your

35
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,780
generation my grandparent's generation

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,270
and also appears to be valid across
various developmental ethics

37
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,979
you can use this language

38
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:05,910
to cap to capture

39
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,069
individual differences in personality
among

40
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,730
very young children you can also uses
language to capture individual

41
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,340
differences in personality armand

42
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,819
on middle-aged people reward people or
whatever

43
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,540
now one thing i have a point out

44
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,349
is that the five factor model itself

45
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,579
can be made even more concise if you
think about it

46
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,499
because those kind of a two-dimensional
superstructure here

47
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:32,919
two different kinds of evaluation

48
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:38,329
first evaluating the person that has
more or less desirable undesirable on

49
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,449
the social groans

50
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:43,870
and evaluating the person who has more
or less

51
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,980
good or bad

52
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,770
on intellectual grounds

53
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,979
so inmates cultures

54
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:53,069
we tend to favor extroverted people over
introverted people we obviously favor

55
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,189
agreeable people over disagreeable
people

56
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:00,569
conscientious people over non conscious
of cartridges people emotionally stable

57
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:04,989
people over in the stable people and we
also tend to value smart people over

58
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:07,700
stupid people

59
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,239
also again

60
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,440
all of this the payoff eleven analysis
that you're going to look at

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,290
you could say that this this five factor
model itself

62
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,189
all

63
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:20,250
can the altered compress

64
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,230
into a two factor model or even a one
factor model

65
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,410
good or bad

66
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,239
personal qualities

67
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,029
okays ope these five

68
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:30,719
factors

69
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,599
because i'm five basic personality
traits okay

70
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,849
extra version agreeable knows
conscientious nis emotional stability

71
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:39,839
and all

72
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,870
openness to experience

73
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,359
and the question is what do you do with
these

74
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,120
without the cartoon

75
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,249
versions of what i've called the
doctrine of trade so hard person a soft

76
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:53,149
for some week for sonora strong version

77
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,150
bud mcpherson simply says

78
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,579
that traits summarize

79
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,890
the services

80
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,299
congress that labels to summarize

81
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,450
various aspects of people's behavior

82
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,790
how coherent

83
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,969
how stable

84
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:11,479
how consistent and predictable it is in
various dimensions

85
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:14,409
so if i see somebody who smells a lot

86
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,569
and somebody who are has a lot of
friends

87
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:22,360
and somebody who blows to a lot of clubs
are going to summarize that person's

88
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,270
behavior in terms of

89
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,919
something like friendliness

90
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,770
but the strong version of the doctrine
of traces what interests us here

91
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,870
and that is but rates

92
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,129
has people to behave in a particular way

93
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:38,830
if i see somebody who smiles a lot

94
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,600
has a lot of friends

95
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,709
alm

96
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:44,129
double lost a lot of clubs

97
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:47,770
that the uh... the idea behind the
strong doctrine of traits is that the

98
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,559
person who does these things be clause

99
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,840
he or she is extroverted

100
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,919
okay

101
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,400
on

102
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,949
that somehow

103
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,449
having this disposition

104
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:58,880
really does dispose u

105
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,749
to behave in particular ways

106
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:04,270
introduce these terms for our last time

107
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,340
coherent stability consistency and
predictability

108
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,650
and i want to are gonna try to explain
those a little bit

109
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,610
all more

110
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,990
all it now

111
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,360
first

112
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,680
with respect to coherence

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,809
what we mean that is that

114
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:20,569
personnel about putting individuals
personality

115
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,969
hangs together

116
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:25,479
makes sense as a coherent paul

117
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:27,340
as a coherent whole

118
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,639
and they can distinguish a couple of
different types of coherence

119
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,890
so for example

120
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,739
there might be coherence along

121
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:37,609
papa graphically different behaviors by
topographic papa graphically beat

122
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:38,650
different behaviors

123
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,009
just mean different behaviors that
involve different parts of the body

124
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,070
so it might be

125
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,270
that a person who tends to smile a lot

126
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,639
also tends to believe

127
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,619
those are different kinds of behaviors

128
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:52,740
and as if there's a correlation between
them

129
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,220
it might be because extroverted people
both penned a smile

130
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,590
and tended tubely

131
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,290
similarly

132
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,070
there's a coherent someone what you
might call semantically different traits

133
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,300
that is traits that are all that have
somewhat different meanings

134
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,139
but still i hope there's a correlation
among them

135
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,039
people who are friendly

136
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,060
tend also to be a sort of

137
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,949
okay tuza carly

138
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,259
being friendly doesn't mean the same
thing as beans assertive

139
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,430
they are totten semantically different
rate labels

140
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,530
but the fact of the matter is that
friend friendliness and assertiveness

141
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,919
tend to go together

142
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,760
and they tend to go together because
they're all paths of facets

143
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,450
all this broader trade

144
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,179
all extra virgin so much of that

145
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:43,070
with with the doctor traits sorry is

146
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,159
every harker cole structure

147
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,150
begins with

148
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:53,400
the big five traits like extra version
and a greater boldness

149
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,029
and mastered underneath these are very
broad traits

150
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:03,460
or more narrowly defined at cyber net
rates like warns and assertiveness

151
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,629
extroverted tend to be warming to
personally warm

152
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:09,210
physically warm but interpersonal e warm

153
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,389
extra parts also tend to be a sort of

154
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,710
here's a grill mullis

155
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,830
there are two facets of their respective
agreeable people tend to be trusting

156
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,969
and they also tend to be altruistic

157
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:23,680
and dusted off under each of these
subordinate rates

158
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,110
or behavioral tendencies so warm people

159
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,409
tend to like most of the people that
they know

160
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:32,160
and a tender form strong attachments to
friends

161
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,139
a sort of people tend to be dominant and
forceful and they tend to lead groups

162
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,390
trusting people tend to believe that
most people are almost

163
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,380
and they tend to assume the best

164
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,860
about people altruistic people

165
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,680
tend to be criticism re body

166
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,770
and they tend to be charitable now wire
and i don't really have a slide

167
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,310
but these are just behavioral tendencies

168
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,260
and so you can imagine that or mastered
underneath here are specific behaviors

169
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,669
observed in specific situations

170
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,300
if i'm extroverted i tend to be warm if
i warm i tend to like most people

171
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,930
and now the next question is

172
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,340
i'm going to meet somebody in a couple
of hours at my office and i got i like

173
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,320
him or not

174
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,439
him personally

175
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,500
when i got home tonight i'm going to
meet my new neighbor just moved in

176
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,910
across the street and the question is

177
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,120
well i'm going to like

178
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,339
him in her or whatever those specific
behaviors

179
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,680
are nestled onto these behavioral

180
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,329
tendencies

181
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:34,960
so that coherence of personality

182
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,949
that's given by these personality traits

183
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:42,449
simply means that there is a really
there as a hierarchy of personality

184
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:43,180
tendencies

185
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:48,410
where we have very brad dispositions
like extra version agreeable dance

186
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,590
somewhat more narrowly defined

187
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,809
are dispositions like warmth and trust
and assertiveness and altruism

188
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,850
and so on all the way down

189
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,530
just like

190
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,450
our discussion of super ordinate and
subordinate categories

191
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,899
here we have

192
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:06,880
subordinate and super wordnet levels of
analysis of behavior

193
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,330
and the idea behind the storm version of
the doctrine of traits

194
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,090
traits

195
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,890
personality this coherence if you say
that somebody is warm

196
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,990
you can

197
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,870
expect them to like most people in the
form strong attachments to their friends

198
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,960
because those are part and parcel of the
warm their specific worries of being

199
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,860
interpersonal e war

200
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,489
okay

201
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:34,509
now with respect to the other three

202
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,700
aspects of what rates do

203
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,540
all traits not only did coherence

204
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,190
behavior

205
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:47,450
but they also gives stability to
behavior over time

206
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,759
somebody is extroverted at time warner

207
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,130
we also expect to find them extroverted

208
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,480
at some later time because they have
been straight

209
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,840
that disposes them to behave in a
particular way

210
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,390
if we find somebody who likes most
people

211
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,599
at age five

212
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:07,699
we expect that people also that person
also toll-like most people and age

213
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:08,610
twelve

214
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,900
stability turns out as an empirical
matter

215
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,459
greatest over short intervals of time
but still the ideas that having a trait

216
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,870
gives stability to new york behavior

217
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,890
severly

218
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,060
we can think about

219
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,690
the consistency odd behavior across
situations

220
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,199
if i smell it somebody in the
supermarket and i got a smile it's but

221
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:34,580
that that somebody other somebody else
on the street

222
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,690
if ari make friends with my new
next-door neighbor

223
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,610
am i going to make friends with the new
colleague who moved into the office next

224
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,560
door mine in them

225
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,940
in pullman hole

226
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,779
and again

227
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:50,960
the ideas that traits make behavior
consistent across situations

228
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,970
it's by virtue of having a trait

229
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,870
your or consistency your behaviors
consistent across situations and again

230
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,880
as an empirical matter

231
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,539
are consistency is greatest

232
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,920
when you are looking at behavior across
the jewish instead are

233
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,260
fairly similar to each other so if
ronald you're looking to buy the right

234
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,860
make friends with a

235
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,630
new personally meet in in my
neighborhood

236
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,150
that might

237
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,020
correlate with the with my tendency to
make friends with a somebody

238
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,410
just join my church or whatever very
similar situations are kinda neighbors

239
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,280
in in some sense

240
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,799
and then finally

241
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,990
it's traits that make these

242
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,700
your predictable

243
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,510
if you know somebody's extroverted if
you know somebody's warm

244
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,330
because

245
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,910
extra version is a disposition to behave
in particular ways

246
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,590
knowing that somebody's extroverted or
to enable you to predict

247
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,530
how old they are going to be haven

248
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,239
in some specific

249
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:54,540
of the in some specific situation

250
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,339
it is to that problem or predictability

251
00:11:57,339 --> 00:11:58,490
that we're going to turn

252
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,420
right now

253
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,939
to what extent ted we predict opin
individuals' behavior

254
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:07,019
in some specific situation

255
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,009
nileen

256
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:09,929
something about his or her

257
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,160
road personality

258
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,720
dispositions

259
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,759
sometimes were able to use

260
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,730
bomb all of them

261
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,139
but personality measurements

262
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:22,120
to predict behavior with quite a bit of
confidence

263
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,649
bomb

264
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,260
here for example

265
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,790
so sweep

266
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,080
have somebody we know was extroverted

267
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,420
we can predict that they're going to be
relatively warm

268
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,420
we could predict

269
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,720
that they're going to

270
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,900
or like most people on average

271
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,680
but the real question is

272
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,010
well this extroverted people like judy
when he meets ur

273
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,759
well this extroverted person

274
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,359
still call judy after she moves away

275
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,039
okay

276
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,080
are these are the kinds of things that
extroverted people do

277
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,580
or if you're a sort of

278
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,940
or if you're extroverted you're going to
be they're going to tend to be assertive

279
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,790
you can be darlington forceful

280
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,690
but then in some specific situation

281
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,390
will this person interrupted speaker

282
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,470
or will this person takeover

283
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,600
the task

284
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,300
again what we're trying to do here

285
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,810
is to use information about people's
personality traits

286
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,290
dispositions to behave in a particular
way

287
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,300
and use that information

288
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,660
how they actually will behave

289
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,560
here a couple more examples of it

290
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,350
from agreeable this no way that
somebody's agreeable

291
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,149
how confident we can we predict

292
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:29,340
they don't let his co-worker borrow some
money

293
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,850
how confident we can we print archery
predict that he'll still like this

294
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,260
co-worker when the co-worker doesn't pay
the money back

295
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,280
okay

296
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,680
idle preventing that a person is
altruistic although

297
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,880
will the person ald of the plate to the
you know store clerk

298
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,490
are or little person

299
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,360
or contribute

300
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,180
the psalm or charity

301
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,550
and again as i said before sometimes

302
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,580
did these kinds of behavioral
dispositions could be very very powerful

303
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,810
predictors of behavior

304
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,949
the best example okay

305
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:03,220
of predicting specific behavior

306
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,920
phloem

307
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,870
qualities of a person from a person's
traits of the additives

308
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,360
probably the best example

309
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,430
comes on the domain of political
behavior

310
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:18,400
where we classify somebody as republican
or a democrat

311
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,279
liberal or conservative

312
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,620
and then predict

313
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,020
how that person is going to vote for a
particular candidate in a particular

314
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,010
election

315
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,070
here is that

316
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,620
recollected by john joseph reported just
a dearest so i'll go

317
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:33,980
analyzing

318
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,059
the relationship between political
attitudes and voting behavior

319
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:41,270
across all large number of presidential
elections

320
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:43,060
are from nineteen seventy two

321
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,540
to nineteen seventy-four

322
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,930
and just to

323
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,269
all of make things all a little bit dull
uh... geezer

324
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:55,910
we've got subjects buckle classified as
basically based on our population sample

325
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,910
united states

326
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,540
we've got subjects classified as
democrats and republicans

327
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,380
and then are they've also rated
themselves as how liberal they are

328
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,759
on a seven-point or the seven point
scale

329
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,760
and then the all what joe stated simply
assess

330
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,920
hello you voted to call people voted

331
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,830
based on are hall log on how liberal or
conservative

332
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,519
all of the political rant asian

333
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,949
all the candidate was

334
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:24,470
and what you can see here

335
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,670
is that there is a very strong
relationship

336
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,589
between political attitudes in general

337
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:32,670
and voting behavior

338
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,230
democrats

339
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,099
or overwhelmingly vote flammable

340
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:38,100
political candidates

341
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,449
republicans overwhelmingly vote

342
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:44,080
for conservative political candidates

343
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,700
correlation point ninety two you can't
get while higher correlation

344
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,270
not in the social sciences

345
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,750
you hardly see correlations that high
art but again

346
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,660
this is something that occurs election
after election

347
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,930
here is our most recent presidential
election carry versus bush

348
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,760
okay

349
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,440
and you can see

350
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,899
demagogued the liberals

351
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,830
voting for carry

352
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,480
conservatives

353
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,689
voting for bush

354
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:13,450
over well mainly

355
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,339
go back one ground versus bush

356
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:17,910
same pattern

357
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,250
liberals voting for gore

358
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,800
bush i've got conservatives

359
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,200
nineteen ninety-six clinton versus dole
same pattern

360
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,800
something funny happens there it's

361
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,180
i think it's ralph nader actually

362
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,450
lomb part sterile the overall pattern is
quite clear

363
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,640
that part

364
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,790
hello liberals are going to vote for
clinton

365
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,620
and conservatives are going to vote for
dole let's just keep going back clinton

366
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,389
versus

367
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:50,560
of the first george bush bush forty one

368
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,570
again a very strong relationship

369
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,770
mike dukakis versus the first george
bush

370
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,149
again a very strong relationship between

371
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,459
people's political orientations whether
they're liberal or conservative

372
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:06,630
and who they're going to vote for

373
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,959
mondale versus reagan

374
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,920
quarter versus reagan

375
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,370
carter versus ford

376
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,720
mcgovern versus nixon

377
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,939
okay and again you see this this same
kind of pattern

378
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,370
these are very

379
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,720
early very powerful predictions

380
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,850
nelene where a person is a republican or
a democrat

381
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,539
youtwo a tremendous amount of leverage

382
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:37,780
in terms of predicting hollow that
individual is going to vote

383
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,059
here's an example of a general
disposition

384
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,730
a dinner tonight that would have just a
legend

385
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,590
favor republicans are favored democrats

386
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,850
predicting behavior

387
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,600
in a specific situation and as i say

388
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,520
very very very strong correlations
remember

389
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,160
correlation can't get any bigger than
one point no

390
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,380
these are correlations

391
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,750
in the high eighties

392
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,380
and all and all the low to mid nineties
they're very very very

393
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,160
very very strong

394
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,720
but now let's don't usually see i have
to tell you

395
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,559
we do not usually see this strong a
level of predictability

396
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,740
i have specific behavior

397
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,550
generalized behavioral tendencies

398
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,670
here is of more represented experiment

399
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,510
all conducted here at berkeley

400
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,039
by david finder is now a professor at
u_c_ riverside

401
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,200
jacket gene block

402
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,740
all who are retired professors here
taught at berkeley

403
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,590
all in this study

404
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,849
aren't the out of the stuff this is a
study of children

405
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:42,840
and all the data domain owners delayed
gratification

406
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,990
this is not topic i'm going to come back
to over and over again in these lectures

407
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,650
to have gratification

408
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:54,820
has to do with the child's ability to
control his or her impulses

409
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,040
all kids one stuff

410
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,220
kids are one stuffed sometimes they
can't wait for other times they can

411
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,020
so very very very important to although
the personality trait

412
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,820
it has to do with what the blocks called
hugo control

413
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,840
the ability to delay gratification talk
date for the things you want

414
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,659
to inhibit aggression not to strike out
when you don't like somebody

415
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:24,460
and the ability to plan ahead in your
behavior to get your assignment start on

416
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,669
time

417
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:27,050
arms and uh...

418
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,350
world and so on

419
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:31,399
so what all funds were conducted in this
study

420
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:35,960
is to take four-year-olds these our
children and they are research nursery

421
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,490
school

422
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,350
here on the berkeley campus

423
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,559
and the teachers rated these children

424
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,700
in terms of there you go control

425
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,540
whether they're able to delay
gratification or not

426
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,270
unless there are many dimension known as
evil resiliency

427
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,050
which basically has to do with the kids
ability to adapt to new environments

428
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,700
how secure is the kid

429
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,640
howell competent as a kid and so on

430
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,580
and then work visa investigators did

431
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:06,630
was to try to use these broad
evaluations of personality

432
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,340
product

433
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,570
how'd children were behaving in a
particular

434
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,350
situation

435
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,980
and there are two situations are that
they are that they studied

436
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,620
wind is known as the gift or a situation

437
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,340
and the other is known as the resistance
of temptation situation

438
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,330
in the gift or a situation

439
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:28,460
the experimenter would come into a room
with a kid was sitting with only gilly

440
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,200
wrapped gift you know i'm eggs right
wrapping paper ribbons and stuff like

441
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,209
that

442
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:36,910
and are going to get to the child is her
four-year-old children

443
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,570
antec i've got a gift for you

444
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,430
but you gotta wait to open it

445
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,929
but you gotta wait

446
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:47,690
arm so don't open it don't open it

447
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:51,629
i got to go away and do something now
just sit here for a while other than

448
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:53,500
ever that gift

449
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,750
and then the experimenter walks away and
of course some kids sit there and they

450
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,280
look at the box and they need fiddle
with the reforms or whatever they do

451
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,800
and other kids are tearing into the box
immediately as soon as the arm

452
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,400
as the investigators left

453
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,159
that's how we mean by doing
gratification

454
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,650
send kids kentucky gratification whether
kids temple gratification

455
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:19,320
can be of yellow in the resistance to
temptation situation the uh... child was

456
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,590
taken with was brought into a room where
there were two sets of toys on one side

457
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,480
of the room

458
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,710
well puncher

459
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,550
kind of or ratty

460
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,420
reopen

461
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,200
dougherty toys not on healthy dirty just
they just didn't look very nice right

462
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,259
and then on the other side of the room
with these

463
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:40,530
really great new terry's bright clean
fresh new

464
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:44,310
the kinds of things that are being
advertised on t_v_ right that very

465
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,230
second

466
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,730
and all of the experimenter says on to
the kid

467
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,840
okay i've got a leave the room now

468
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,300
and all while i'm gone

469
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,289
you can play with these toys over here

470
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:57,530
meeting the ready duri old undesirable
toys

471
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,010
but touch these stories over here

472
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,559
because they belong to missus
morgenstern and also for her class they

473
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,160
are not for you

474
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,640
the experimenter leaves the room and of
course some kids star claim of the toys

475
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,120
and immediately some kids run right over
the missus morgenstern stories and start

476
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,700
playing with them despite the fact that
that's been expressly forbidden by the

477
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,630
alone

478
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,420
by the uh... by the experimenter

479
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,220
so the question here is

480
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,350
how well can we predict

481
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,310
harwell children are going to

482
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,710
the lei how long children are going to
delay in the gift of my situation

483
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,260
and how welcome to predict

484
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,159
how ought to resistant a temptation

485
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:39,749
children are going to be in this other
situation

486
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:41,119
and the answer is

487
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,610
that yes i am ability to predict

488
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,680
these all of these behaviors

489
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,010
also under his colleagues looked at

490
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,130
four different

491
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,630
all predictor variables here is just a
thought brutal measure of i_q_

492
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,060
and that site

493
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,490
that sold much smaller correlation than
point nine five

494
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,160
but it's still significantly better than
zero so there is some predictive power

495
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,810
here

496
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,450
here is the critical

497
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,960
are persona dimension

498
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,410
eagle control estimates that's related
to the big five trade of conscientious

499
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,100
nis

500
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,570
and again there's some ability to
predict behavior correlations un

501
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,970
significantly different from zero
correlational point to five

502
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,920
interestingly eagle resiliency also
predicts behavior a little bit this is a

503
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,650
trait that's related to mirada schism

504
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,950
alms and out that some of the again

505
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,430
civ not point nine five but not zero are
either

506
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,770
and then one of the items

507
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:40,260
that that showed that the teachers rated
the children on was the specific trade

508
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:40,929
aud

509
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:44,480
is up and they had to delay
gratification

510
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,890
and again you get all they have
significant correlation if your unable

511
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,620
to the lake ratification highly on able
to look to the lake ratification

512
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,090
don't resist very well so that's why the
correlation is negative

513
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,919
but again the point here is

514
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,989
that you do have slam ability

515
00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:02,970
toooo

516
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,659
predict behavior

517
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:07,500
juvenile ij all of the individuals

518
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,920
of the individuals personality traits

519
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,970
but the other point is

520
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,220
these this correlation which is quite
representative of the studies that have

521
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,140
been done

522
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,280
on in this domain

523
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,539
there are limits to did to the degree

524
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:22,170
that you can't predict

525
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,360
behavior in some specific situation for
example walter michelle

526
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,980
uh... has suggested all of that the
upper limit

527
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,990
of the correlation between personality
in general

528
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,920
behavior in some specific situation

529
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,510
isabel point three oh

530
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,320
all of member correlations

531
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,649
vary from zero

532
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:43,500
to one

533
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,340
this is a correlation that is better
than nothing

534
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,770
okay but for from perfect

535
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,359
the general idea here

536
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,690
is that there is a ceiling

537
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,169
on the extent to which

538
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:55,990
we can predict behavior

539
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,799
in a specific situation from knowing

540
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,460
the persons

541
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,780
personality traits in general there is
some predictive leverage

542
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,470
but there's not by a lot of predictive

543
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,860
and this is just one study autumn dozens
and hundreds of dollars buddies such

544
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,500
studies

545
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,070
that have been done in the literature

546
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,120
that suggests that there are limits

547
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,700
on the extent to which

548
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,290
we could predict behavior

549
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,350
audience on specific situation

550
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,820
from knowledge of

551
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,090
the individual's personal retrace

552
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,630
armed

553
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,370
that's one part of the dialectic between

554
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,620
epperson and his or her behavior

555
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,280
the died that part of the dialectic that
says

556
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,410
there's a classical relationship

557
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,040
between

558
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,740
the internal

559
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,220
qualities of the person

560
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,140
what his or her traits and attitudes are

561
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,830
and how that person is going to be haven

562
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,200
in some particular situation

563
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,420
let's stop for a second and see if there
are any questions about this

564
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,730
there is some relationship some
predictability but it's far from perfect

565
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,309
that's three bottom line here

566
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:06,320
any questions what yes

567
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,830
all guys across america

568
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,130
it's just because of the way
correlations work

569
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:15,100
all be able to deliver gratification
you're highly unable to blade

570
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,919
ratification

571
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,660
that you can't wait very long

572
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,680
okay remember the positive correlations
high values odd one variable predict

573
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,650
high values on another variable

574
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,290
when a coalition is negative

575
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,210
high values on one variable predict low
values on the other so

576
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,870
if we had said

577
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,890
able to the lake ratification

578
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,679
if the specific item had said eventful
belay gratification

579
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,460
but carly she would have been

580
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,289
positive

581
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:45,069
twenty-seven but the specific item the
teachers rated was unable to belabor

582
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:50,290
application

583
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:54,570
well because that's the kind of more or
less the closest

584
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,320
big five straight

585
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,280
blocker jack block who own kuo but will
become fund or work

586
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,630
not contradict believer in the big for
you

587
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:09,700
he's a believer in what he calls the big
to on hugo controlling legal resiliency

588
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,210
but when you look at what he means by
evil control

589
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,389
it's very close to conscientious

590
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:17,960
if you look at what he means by evil
resiliency is very close to murata

591
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,720
schism

592
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,510
if you like the word

593
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,610
pay no attention to that part

594
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,380
pay no attention by men behind a curtain

595
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:27,929
alm

596
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:34,929
what else is there

597
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,110
yeah what we mean by topographic we
different behaviors means

598
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,179
behaviors and involve different

599
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,150
parts of the body

600
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,960
to be done to make a long story short

601
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,779
so smiling involves my face

602
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:51,120
and waiting and both my hands

603
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,899
but if i'm a friendly guy i tend to
smile of people attend a way that people

604
00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:58,400
but their topic graphically different
behaviors

605
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,450
but they're correlated with each other

606
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,070
people who tend to smile tender wave
because the other kinds of things that

607
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,799
extroverted people do

608
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,029
by semantically different rates

609
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:11,410
we mean traits that really have
different meanings

610
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,810
arm

611
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,789
friendliness

612
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:16,850
doesn't mean the same thing as
assertiveness

613
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:17,410
okay

614
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,039
to be friendly means uh...

615
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,130
have lots of friends and be nice to
people

616
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,700
too assertive means to put yourself
forward and a kind of take control of

617
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,730
things

618
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,639
but as a matter of fact

619
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,559
these two semantically different rates
are karmaloop park are correlated with

620
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,789
each other

621
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:34,480
because they're both related to this

622
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,570
higher order trait of extra version

623
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,300
okay as women

624
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:44,720
anything else about this yet one more

625
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,520
yes that's right the difference between
the week version and the are in the

626
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,530
strong version

627
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,299
is that

628
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:55,120
in the week version treats just kind of
summarize a person's tendencies

629
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,570
so if i said

630
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,450
judy is

631
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:58,860
intelligent

632
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,009
so much or how do you know judy's
intelligent

633
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:04,829
i said well if you know she wins the
chess tournament and she understands the

634
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:07,809
symphony and all this kind of stuff

635
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:09,830
but if i say

636
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,850
judy's intelligence

637
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,840
causes her

638
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,690
to win the chess tournament

639
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,759
that's the strong doctrine okay

640
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,190
where we can say that

641
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,690
having a trait

642
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,149
causes you to behave in a particular way

643
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:26,570
it's at strong version of the doctrine
of trades that's really at issue here

644
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,950
because the idea here is that

645
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,780
being able to

646
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,760
on where are we

647
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,940
dealing with a new

648
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,779
have been high on the eagle control

649
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:37,780
classes you

650
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,700
the daily ratification

651
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,850
or are being high on non-verbal i_q_ for
that matter causes you to be able to

652
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:45,649
lake

653
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:46,250
gratification

654
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,510
now what we want to do that with his
look at the other direction

655
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,880
of causality

656
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,020
okay

657
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,780
and he looked at

658
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,710
relationship between

659
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,840
qualities of the person

660
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,029
his or her political attitudes his or
her

661
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:03,220
doll ability to the lake ratification

662
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,220
and behavior in some specific situation
that we want to do now

663
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:13,320
is to look at our recent recall of fact
all the individuals' behavior on the

664
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,080
person him or herself

665
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,309
how the individuals' behavior

666
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:19,289
deduct back

667
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:20,400
if you will

668
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,700
to alter

669
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,230
traipse the attitudes the dispositions

670
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,929
all of the individual him or herself

671
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:29,840
and that's a good example of this

672
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,919
is what's known in the trade as
discussed in your textbook lightens

673
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,409
textbook as the self perception theory
of attitudes formulated by daryl bam

674
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:44,230
back when he was a staffer professor
bemis now at cornell university

675
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:47,059
and the sale perception theory about it
dudes

676
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:52,989
reverses our usual view orbit called
relationship between attitudes and

677
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:53,780
behavior

678
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,830
we usually think of

679
00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:00,100
of attitudes as causing people to behave
the way they do

680
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,159
and the liberals

681
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,130
liberal nis classes him

682
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,810
vote for terry as opposed to bush

683
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:08,530
causes him

684
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,340
to vote for

685
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,460
mcgovern as opposed to mix and or
whatever

686
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,529
and but then the argued but that wasn't
necessarily the case

687
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:20,840
rather from guns point of view our
behavior

688
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,060
in some very important sense

689
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,230
causes us to have the attitudes that we
have

690
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,910
put more concrete lee

691
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:32,950
it's not a perception or awareness of
our own behavior

692
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,309
at least perform

693
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:39,010
attitudes that are consistent with the
behavior

694
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:43,669
in the usual scheme of things the
attitude comes first

695
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:46,290
and the behavior flows from it

696
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,760
in behrens

697
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,089
self perception theory of attitudes

698
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:52,380
that behavior comes first

699
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,750
and the attitudes

700
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,910
let me give you an example of this

701
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:00,590
all this is a classic experiment in
social psychology known as the for the

702
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,970
door effect

703
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,709
this was an experiment conducted in the
context of his safe driving campaign

704
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:08,770
in the state of california

705
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:13,049
and what these investigators did was in
the guy is all of public opinion

706
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:14,500
all surveyors

707
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,780
then door-to-door in a number of
neighborhoods air nam

708
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:22,340
uh... in in the heart of various cities
in california mostly

709
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,900
palo alto

710
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,210
armed and tabatha neighborhoods

711
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,640
and whoever not old woman and knocked on
the door whoever opened the door they

712
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,100
said

713
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,799
i were from the california safe driving
campaign

714
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,620
and we have this petition

715
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,970
that supports safe driving

716
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,340
would you like to sign this petition

717
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,649
anybody here in

718
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:49,370
opposed to safe driving

719
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,530
pretty much everybody has expressed
signs this petition gus right you're not

720
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,040
going to say well now allow opposed to
safe driving i'm not going to sign your

721
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,750
stupid petition whatever so they've got
around to have to households of these

722
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,809
various neighborhoods

723
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:04,200
and that's the best line of this
petition

724
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,799
and virtually everybody who was asked to
sign the petition

725
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,740
agreed to do so

726
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,770
later

727
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:15,100
barely returned to these neighborhoods
and now instead of knocking on the

728
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,279
although two-and-a-half the doors in the
neighborhood

729
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,360
they not done all the doors in the
neighborhood and said

730
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,929
harley

731
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:25,470
were from the california safe driving
campaign

732
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,230
we have this

733
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,759
drive carefully sign

734
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:32,470
that we would like to post in your front
yard

735
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,300
and is that the biggest

736
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,160
or girliest saline you can imagine

737
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,809
that's just

738
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,160
as old as a as a piece of silage

739
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,370
putting that site in your front yard
would drive property values down by

740
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,090
thirty or forty percent it's just that
there was just a terrible

741
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,410
on either side

742
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,220
all dot

743
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,180
it turned out

744
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,730
large numbers of people agreed to post a
sign in the neighborhood

745
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,659
and what's interesting in about it

746
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:03,679
is that people who are earlier signed
the petition

747
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,870
we're much more likely to agree to post
a sign it and their front yards

748
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,729
than people

749
00:34:09,729 --> 00:34:10,700
who hadn't

750
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,379
that asked

751
00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:13,339
to sign the petition

752
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:17,909
now i don't mind that virtually
everybody who was asked to sign the

753
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,359
petition

754
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:19,899
did so

755
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:22,589
so these people verbal reasonable gas

756
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:25,559
is that these people who weren't asked
to sign the petition

757
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,039
what they've done it

758
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:29,909
but it turns out it is the act

759
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:34,109
on signing dot petition

760
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:38,809
that leads people two-degree supposed to
be a big audibly

761
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:41,490
all its safe driving a drive carefully
sign

762
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,939
in their own

763
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:44,809
twelve in their front yard

764
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:47,080
wetsuits not happen in this experiment

765
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,219
was at the subjects who signed the
petition

766
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,209
something went through their minds like
this all i remember i signed this

767
00:34:53,209 --> 00:34:54,409
petition

768
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:57,569
almost really be in favor of safe
driving

769
00:34:57,569 --> 00:35:01,849
therefore because signed so much in
favor of safe driving all but the post a

770
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,729
sign

771
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:05,949
bad behavior

772
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:10,090
led to the creation of an attitude
consistent with the behavior

773
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:15,130
and then they had no release form to
entertain led to or further behavior

774
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,010
this is known as the footnote door
technique

775
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,840
something that's known by

776
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,499
palm uh...

777
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:25,000
salesman sales people and political
candidates the world over

778
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,739
and for that matter anybody

779
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:30,739
if you want to get somebody to do you
want big favor

780
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:34,419
ask them to do a little favor first

781
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:37,470
they do it a little favorably on like
this guy

782
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,970
no i don't do the big favour so you've
got them not one of a quarter and pretty

783
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,529
soon you're signing over your monthly
paycheck

784
00:35:45,529 --> 00:35:48,470
but again it all starts with the
behavior

785
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,410
the behavior comes first

786
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,619
here is another example

787
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:56,169
this is the experiment by bob shall be
at a higher is at the state university

788
00:35:56,169 --> 00:35:58,239
on subject recruitment

789
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:03,430
offered online this experiment subjects
recruited for experiment by telephone

790
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,999
all and all

791
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:07,130
the subjects were informed

792
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,770
before they agreed to participate

793
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:12,689
that the experiment would begin at seven
o'clock in the morning

794
00:36:12,689 --> 00:36:16,969
hi i'm bob shall be reelected to come
into this experiment it it's going to it

795
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:21,900
won't take place at seven o'clock in the
morning william will you come in

796
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,119
and uh...

797
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,339
for the other half of the subjects they
were informed a different began at seven

798
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:29,789
a_m_ after they agreed to participate

799
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:33,419
high on bob shall be the i'm doing this
experiment would you like to produce a

800
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:36,670
cultural right like to participate

801
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,519
thank you very much

802
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,570
it starts at seven o'clock all see you
then

803
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,929
and now the question is

804
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:46,989
how many people will actually arrive on
time for the experiment

805
00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:49,419
here is the data here

806
00:36:49,419 --> 00:36:51,940
subjects who'll well-informed

807
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,280
about the starting time of the
experiment

808
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,160
before they agreed to participate

809
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,439
well actually less likely to show

810
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:00,239
for the experiment

811
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:05,089
subjects or informed of the although the
father of the overall

812
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,140
with experimental start time

813
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,270
after they agreed to participate

814
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,400
all were much more likely to show

815
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,329
why because child he had his foot in the
door

816
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:17,789
they had already agreed to participate

817
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:20,790
that behavior appellee band led the
subjects

818
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:25,940
to four minute attitude that was
consistent with actually are showing up

819
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,440
later

820
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,060
thus in their favor

821
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,560
agreeing to participate

822
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,780
leads to the big favor later on

823
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,819
actually showing up

824
00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:35,049
at the on godly all work

825
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:35,830
seven o'clock

826
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,529
how in the morning

827
00:37:37,529 --> 00:37:38,130
again

828
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,640
what what what this experiment
illustrates

829
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,960
is the reversal or the usual god
direction of causality

830
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,470
bad behavior comes first

831
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,010
and the attitude

832
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,279
columns

833
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:53,199
this is the reciprocal affect

834
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,779
or behavior on the person here's one
more example another classic experiment

835
00:37:57,779 --> 00:38:00,450
by shelley check in now at n_y_u_

836
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:03,249
on conservation attitudes and behavior

837
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:06,999
in the yard guise of a young

838
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:10,659
prescreened like one you did on at the
very beginning of this sort of the

839
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:16,799
semester all touch a chemical and and
and baldwin administered a test of

840
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:20,779
environmental attitudes obviously things
like do you believe in environmental

841
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:24,729
conservation do you think it's important
to pick up trash do you think uh... it's

842
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:26,010
okay to throw your

843
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,770
coke bottles by the side of the road
stuff like that river when the systems

844
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:33,840
twenty years ago report that we're on
the time of the first birthday where

845
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,750
people did actually very fairly widely
on their attitudes about environmental

846
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,749
conservation

847
00:38:39,749 --> 00:38:44,060
but instead on what you did in in any
event what dot jacob involving dead

848
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,559
was the classified as subjects as

849
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,749
prayer book work on environmental

850
00:38:49,749 --> 00:38:50,499
conservation

851
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:52,280
all and also

852
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,010
classify them as in terms of whether
they had week

853
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,669
or stray dog

854
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:59,539
all orcon attitudes

855
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:01,279
after this pretest

856
00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:04,170
trumpeter baldwin administered another
questionnaire

857
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,050
in which subjects were asked to reflect

858
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,989
on their specific behaviors

859
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:13,119
with respect to environmental
conservation

860
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,700
so for example all

861
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,179
old thought that there were

862
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:18,519
items like

863
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,589
i pick up other people's garbage okay

864
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:23,779
even

865
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:25,099
very

866
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:28,359
pro environmental people don't
necessarily pick up other people's

867
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:30,919
garbage one april when they find that
lying around

868
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:33,909
so one group got these very difficult
items were

869
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:35,890
most people are going to say no

870
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,160
and i've got a group of of the people

871
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,600
got these other items

872
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,599
where all

873
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:44,630
you know i leave the lights on and clean
rooms are not using way everybody does

874
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,900
that from time to time it's the kind of
thing it's easy to answer yes on too

875
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,269
what they did with the ethical to

876
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:53,180
wind one group

877
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,109
to reflect on their work

878
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:57,630
prayer environmental behaviors

879
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,779
and another group

880
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:02,030
i have some questions that led them to
reflect on their

881
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,359
aunty

882
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,520
environmental behaviors

883
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,929
and then

884
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:07,880
we administered the test

885
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,910
of environmental attitudes

886
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,509
what happened there're

887
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:13,419
is that

888
00:40:13,419 --> 00:40:17,069
for subjects who had

889
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:18,109
relatively weak

890
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:21,250
pro or empty and barter mental attitudes

891
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:21,940
okay

892
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,970
when they were all

893
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,919
when they are what we're retested

894
00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:29,499
the distinction between them became even
greater

895
00:40:29,499 --> 00:40:30,779
when subjects

896
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:32,479
with we've got it too

897
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:36,929
will lead to believe that actually
behaved in a way that was pro

898
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:38,519
environmental conservation

899
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,690
baby came

900
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,049
more strongly in favor of environmental
conservation

901
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:46,139
when subjects were lad

902
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:46,680
retrieve

903
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,269
bof a memory

904
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:54,229
behaviors that were opposed to
environmental conservation they became

905
00:40:54,229 --> 00:40:56,459
all dog a book more negatively

906
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:58,750
although if alton

907
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,349
disposed

908
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:02,280
towards that behavior the experiment
didn't work that way for people with

909
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,900
strong environmental conservation
attitudes okay which is interesting but

910
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,399
here's another case

911
00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:12,229
proceeding in your own behavior

912
00:41:12,229 --> 00:41:14,289
leader of four men attitude

913
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:18,829
that's consistent with their behavior
that you proceed okay

914
00:41:18,829 --> 00:41:20,260
all of these experiments

915
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,339
are consistent with this

916
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:28,209
idea of daryl barons about the self
perception our theory of attitudes

917
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:30,700
the people in for their attitudes

918
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,670
from knowledge of their own behaviors

919
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:37,150
which is if you think about it the same
way we infer

920
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:37,660
home

921
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,819
or other people's attitudes if i want to
know whether you're

922
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:44,149
pro rent the environmental conservation
are falling around and see if you pick

923
00:41:44,149 --> 00:41:47,969
up other people's garbage in we've
lights on the rooms are not using and

924
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,829
stuff like that

925
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:51,309
themselves

926
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:55,509
we do with ourselves as well we don't
have attitudes

927
00:41:55,509 --> 00:41:59,300
what we do is we form they don't know
that it is our cause our behavior

928
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,869
rather reform attitudes

929
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:06,589
all in line with the behaviors that all
that we engage in

930
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:10,250
one more example of this paw paws idea

931
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:14,460
is what's known as the james lang a
theory all of you mention which

932
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,749
claiborne also talks about

933
00:42:16,749 --> 00:42:19,070
again our traditional view

934
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,270
the traditional view that believe james
sort or the crystallized

935
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,299
is that even mentions

936
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:28,699
lead us to behave in particular ways

937
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:32,699
all if i walk in belum guarded from
walking across campus and i've got a

938
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:35,469
jump start of the bushes near california
hole

939
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:39,670
that rebuffed is going to elicit fierer
in me

940
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,579
and the fear is going to make me right
away

941
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:45,549
the emotion closes me to behave

942
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:48,769
in pay particular

943
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:51,799
jane said gee maybe it's the other way
around

944
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:57,770
maybe on survey shows of our own
behavior cause or a professional states

945
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:03,329
as james put it from an doesn't run from
the bear because he's afraid

946
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:05,059
the man is afraid

947
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:07,380
because he runs from the bearer

948
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,109
but behavior comes first the internal

949
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:12,039
emotional state

950
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:14,050
all columns of comes later

951
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:18,489
now this is a very controversial
although point-of-view and all

952
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:20,130
and out of a psychology

953
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,879
but there is some on some evidence on in
favor of it

954
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:29,379
all here's kind of the traditional view
here all the from from from paul ekman

955
00:43:29,379 --> 00:43:31,959
facial expressions of emotion

956
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:34,659
being in that particular emotional state

957
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:36,369
causes us

958
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:38,410
behave in a particular way

959
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,640
indirect wins case

960
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,500
are causes us to expressed sorrow motion
allstate's

961
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,610
on our faces so

962
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,399
here we have ek wins

963
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:50,349
basic emotions happiness sadness

964
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:51,190
fear

965
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,999
anger surprise and discussed

966
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:56,269
and the traditional view

967
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:57,859
although she will states

968
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:00,870
a characteristic of us as people

969
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,019
classes oz

970
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:05,220
make these facial expressions

971
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,469
but james and his of width

972
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:12,970
thus deduction data psychologist name
logger said no

973
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:18,859
expressions are caused bio motions
expressions harvey motion the behavior

974
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:22,649
comes first the emotion

975
00:44:22,649 --> 00:44:28,219
here is an example that parking that
kind of illustrates palm uh... james's

976
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:28,759
point

977
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:30,909
was work by james letter

978
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:32,500
all in which all

979
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,920
all in the guys all calibrating some
equipment some psycho physiological

980
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,410
recording equipment also

981
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:46,649
layered after subjects to hold certain
expressions on their faces

982
00:44:46,649 --> 00:44:48,780
and while they were doing that

983
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:54,530
he collected all he collected various
kinds of mood ratings you get some sense

984
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,099
of what wrongful

985
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,059
of what he did

986
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:00,380
if you take your pen or pencil and just
do two things

987
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,699
all first

988
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,939
arctic about a pencil not dot point okay

989
00:45:04,939 --> 00:45:11,939
alm and just hold it between your lips

990
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:14,309
okay

991
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:21,309
and then do the same thing and hold it
between your teeth

992
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:23,619
notice

993
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:27,319
that when you hold

994
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:28,690
all

995
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,269
thought that that would when when you
hold the uh... the pencil in your lips

996
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:33,319
all between your legs

997
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:36,800
your facial expression begins to looks
at you all look pretty fair

998
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,329
when you're doing that

999
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:44,429
whereas when you hold the barbara berra
pencil between your teeth

1000
00:45:44,429 --> 00:45:49,130
a little bit estas kinda naturally all
look very happy all there

1001
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:53,630
and that's actually what larry david he
manipulated people's faces

1002
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,749
so that they were expressing

1003
00:45:55,749 --> 00:45:59,250
fear or anger or discussed or sadness

1004
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:04,069
and then ask the subjects or write
themselves on with their most states

1005
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:05,369
and they discovered

1006
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:08,239
was a subjects

1007
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:11,440
mabe who was manipulated facial
expression that was a facial expression

1008
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,719
of fear

1009
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:13,660
actually

1010
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,410
felt

1011
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:16,009
fearful

1012
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:19,189
subjects whose faces look angry

1013
00:46:19,189 --> 00:46:19,960
actually

1014
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,900
felt angry

1015
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,989
subject since faces

1016
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,599
well looked like they were in disgust

1017
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:30,689
felt so im discussed at that one didn't
work out so well but it worked out very

1018
00:46:30,689 --> 00:46:32,169
nicely for said this

1019
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:35,789
he'd be all subjects whose fill a facial
manipulation of the facial expressions

1020
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:36,910
were manipulated

1021
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,430
to reflect sadness

1022
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,809
actually began to feel sad

1023
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:43,939
that behavior came first

1024
00:46:43,939 --> 00:46:46,299
and the mood came later

1025
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:48,610
here's yet another example of how

1026
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,809
your behavior

1027
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:51,329
feedback

1028
00:46:51,329 --> 00:46:53,479
to shape

1029
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:58,059
traits your attitudes your moods and
depart and so on

1030
00:46:58,059 --> 00:46:59,999
all of which has to do

1031
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:01,019
with this

1032
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:04,330
general idea that there is a very
separate colt

1033
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:05,720
calls our relation

1034
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,710
between the characteristics of the
person

1035
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:11,869
and the person's overt behavior

1036
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:17,090
sometimes the persons traits in states
moods and attitudes

1037
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:18,849
lead the person to behave

1038
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:23,650
in the way that he or she does that's
one side of the causal link

1039
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,490
all other times

1040
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:27,140
behavior comes first

1041
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,320
and the internal disposition or st

1042
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,619
cotton second

1043
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:33,939
behaving in a particular way

1044
00:47:33,939 --> 00:47:36,059
leads you to all have

1045
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:38,469
a particular kind of emotional state

1046
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:42,939
this is the kind of situation that
summed up in and anybody here ever see

1047
00:47:42,939 --> 00:47:45,939
you know the movie or the play the king
and i agree and in the high schools

1048
00:47:45,939 --> 00:47:49,459
something like that gay around that's
long before i happy to know i'm not

1049
00:47:49,459 --> 00:47:52,099
going to sing it to you here

1050
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:57,049
whenever i feel afraid i'd hold my head
a wrecked and whistle a happy two nd so

1051
00:47:57,049 --> 00:47:59,799
no one will suspect i'm afraid

1052
00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:04,249
and then it goes on and on and on welch
everyday my shoes i strike a careless

1053
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:04,790
posed

1054
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:08,570
and whistle are happy to him so no one
ever knows i'm afraid

1055
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:12,660
and then the chances are not talking to
her son is they're pulling up by the doc

1056
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:17,450
in not in bangkok the result of this
deception is very strange to tell

1057
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:22,650
for when i for the people i fear rifle
myself as well

1058
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,009
bad behavior comes first

1059
00:48:25,009 --> 00:48:26,350
wesley that have been thrown

1060
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,340
makes you feel less afraid

1061
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,010
behaving as if you're not afraid

1062
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,709
makes you feel less afraid

1063
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,150
behaviors are caused by

1064
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,730
internal states and traits

1065
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:39,339
but they also

1066
00:48:39,339 --> 00:48:39,839
callers

1067
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,619
you listed vent also can deal with it

1068
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,479
internal states and traits

1069
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:48,239
that's the reset record relationship
between the person in his or her

1070
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:49,169
behavior

1071
00:48:49,169 --> 00:48:50,800
next time on monday

1072
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,270
look at the same reciprocal relationship

1073
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,710
that obtains between

1074
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,030
the environment

1075
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:58,019
and behavior

1076
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:58,459
thank you very much
