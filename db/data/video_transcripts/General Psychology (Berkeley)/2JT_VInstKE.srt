anything else

83
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:23,059
okay let's see if we can figure out what
we've been doing all semester

84
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,479
this is a temporal power didn't bother
apollo adelphi

85
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:34,330
and inscribed on the temple of apollo at
delphi is this little phrase meant about

86
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,599
yourself

87
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,719
which is what

88
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:41,340
culture was all about

89
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,100
little bit later socrates off his
deathbed

90
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,529
reminds his disciples that

91
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:49,240
the unexamined life

92
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,409
is not worth living

93
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:55,110
these are aphorism was nogales up

94
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,960
the unexamined life is not worth living

95
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,460
exemplify her golden age of greek
philosophy all of the beginnings of the

96
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,550
western tradition and forcibly

97
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,289
out of which are modern understanding of
things although that develops

98
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,500
then the seventeenth century

99
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,549
read a descartes

100
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,150
french a mesh philosopher

101
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,360
hadir radical doubts about everything in
the world including whether he existed

102
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,340
he sat down to think about it

103
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,770
and then realized that because he was
thinking he must exist

104
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:36,289
couto air goes so my think therefore i
am the beginnings of western modern

105
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:40,909
philosophy the beginning of our modern
underscore arrow of increase into the

106
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:44,459
workings of the human mind

107
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:47,660
modern scientific psychology is also

108
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,580
participant in this history

109
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,780
we've now of although the arranged a
scientific apparatus a scientific

110
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,300
discipline

111
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,620
by which we can ask the same questions
about the mind that have doubled

112
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,680
fall-off suffers from the time of plato
onward

113
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,449
and especially the time from descartes
onward

114
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,620
how the mind works

115
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,330
how mental process these are related to
bodily processes

116
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,490
how we use our minds to also head of the
problems of the encounter in the

117
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,430
environment

118
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,630
on negotiate our relationships with
other people or create new ideas create

119
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,480
new things and all of that

120
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,289
use the same questions fall off the
person that has been for a long time

121
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:34,229
the first answer that psychology gives
us

122
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:39,490
is around lines really do matter having
a mind to really makes the difference

123
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,020
because it turns out that from a
psychological point of view

124
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,620
our behaviors part actions

125
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,110
are closed by our mental states

126
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,720
that we behave

127
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,110
ordered the the way we behave in various
situations

128
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,110
has caused

129
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,480
by the way we think about those
situations how we perceive

130
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,789
the president environment

131
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:03,369
what we remember from the past

132
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:08,460
what we expect to occur in the future
and halloween think about all of those

133
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,620
things

134
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,010
not just cognitive processes of course
but our feelings

135
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,770
in various situations

136
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,610
our goals in various situations also
matter

137
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,389
to how we're going to be heyy

138
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:24,249
whatsoever minds what's going through
our minds

139
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:25,810
causes us to behave

140
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,550
the are

141
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,610
uh... the causes us to behave the way we
do

142
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,879
but i think we know

143
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,529
is that cognitive processes processes on
proceeding

144
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:37,779
remembering

145
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:38,490
thinking

146
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,360
are active cognitive processing

147
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,500
we are not behaving installing all
picture wall

148
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,779
all innate reflexes and instincts

149
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:52,590
condition responses of various kinds

150
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,479
buck we are actively trying to
understand

151
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:56,920
project

152
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,990
and control the world around us

153
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,800
when we learn

154
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,919
something new we are action to try to
make sense for the world we're trying to

155
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,260
predict in control

156
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,729
the events the we experience

157
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:11,860
when we attacked

158
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,080
objects in the environment or making
judgments about whether there they are

159
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,119
or not

160
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:22,210
when we tried to perform to for mental
representations

161
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:28,000
of these objects we are actively filling
in the gaps of stimulus information

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,670
making inferences about

163
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,570
why did object is

164
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,050
object is

165
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,390
big it is

166
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,890
what's it doing

167
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,810
what we can do with it

168
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,870
what it can do with us

169
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,699
similarly

170
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:44,380
well and we remember

171
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,620
the past we are filling in the gaps

172
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,960
trace information is incomplete

173
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,059
so again

174
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:56,249
in the same way that we construct a
mental representation of the present

175
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:56,850
environment

176
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,430
were also trying to

177
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,230
reconstruct

178
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,790
all clear all of the cargo understanding
of the past

179
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,170
both perception

180
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,149
both proceeding and remembering

181
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:13,100
our problem solving for trying to figure
out what's going on right now we're

182
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,040
trying to figure out what happened

183
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,390
in the past

184
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,370
and finally when it comes to thinking

185
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:25,030
reasoning and problem solving judgment
decision making

186
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:30,019
fact process these are not proven by by
recipes by algorithms

187
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,240
but rather they're driven by realistic
sharp cuts

188
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,769
in which we try to make

189
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:40,410
do the best we can with limited
information to make render judgments

190
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,770
wonder conditions

191
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,980
uncertainty

192
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,060
i've never seen

193
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,449
that we've encountered in this course

194
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:53,450
is the theme of the interaction between
the person and the situation

195
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,320
people are part of the situations to
which they're respond the situation to

196
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,110
which we respond is an environment
that's full public people

197
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,769
we now understand

198
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:08,740
that people are not simply affected by
their environments

199
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,730
but whether

200
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,510
that people have the ability to change
their environments in various ways

201
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,639
true create the environment which they
respond

202
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,600
by prostheses like fire evocation
selection

203
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,969
behavioral manipulation

204
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:27,810
and cognitive transformation

205
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,880
equally important

206
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,580
we've learned that the person

207
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,490
his or her behavior

208
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,150
and the environment in which that takes
place

209
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,500
these are not independent entities

210
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,529
they're constantly interacting with each
other in a system characterized

211
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:46,139
by body directional causality

212
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:48,149
where people shape apartments

213
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:50,220
and environments shape behavior

214
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,320
and behavior feeds back to change the
person who engaged in that behavior

215
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,239
these theme of interaction runs
throughout all of psychology

216
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,579
but especially

217
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,339
all that that is ans especially
important theme

218
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,939
and personality and social

219
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,260
psychology

220
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,850
but it's also a team that comes through

221
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,630
when we talk about

222
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,339
development how do we get

223
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:16,919
the bags we've got

224
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,460
how do we acquire

225
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,999
though about the capacity that we have
to think

226
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:24,269
and remember and reason

227
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:25,580
about the world

228
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,990
this interaction comes up first

229
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,350
when we talk about

230
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,370
how jeans

231
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,730
and genotypes

232
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,030
end up producing individual phenotypes

233
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,279
the interaction

234
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,730
of genetic potential

235
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,340
with environmental reality is what

236
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,970
the individual what he or she

237
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,890
or for that because

238
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,220
the child isn't just a creature that
develops

239
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,990
development isn't just something that
happens to the child

240
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,599
but rather all along the way

241
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:01,820
the child is in active agent of his or
her own development

242
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,930
the child is

243
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,780
actually trying to

244
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,550
developments trying to develop is
working on at trying to on improved his

245
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,990
or her understanding of the world

246
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,259
and that's true

247
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:17,010
even past childhood in adolescence

248
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,720
adulthood middle-age or old age

249
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,119
across the waistband

250
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,670
from birth to death

251
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,320
people are parts of their environments

252
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,630
and they are also agents of their own
development

253
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,610
and again when we come to think about

254
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,490
hold the person and the environment
interact

255
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,470
we understand in a way that we never did
before

256
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,209
the profound importance

257
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:42,920
of the naa naa shared environment

258
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,300
in developing

259
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,180
human uniqueness

260
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,610
but genetic endowment that we share with
other family members it's important

261
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,420
but it's not decisive

262
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,259
the family environment that we share
with other family members

263
00:12:58,259 --> 00:12:59,489
partners is important

264
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:01,349
but it's not decisive either

265
00:13:01,349 --> 00:13:04,280
the most important aspect of development

266
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,079
the experiences

267
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,600
that each individual has unique
experiences that make

268
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,789
the unique

269
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:13,270
person

270
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,030
that he or she is

271
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:22,120
this team of interaction also plays out
when we come to try to figure out

272
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,130
her mental illness happens and what we
can do about it

273
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,769
in the same aid that we see

274
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:33,230
interactions between persons and
situations

275
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,009
personality

276
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:35,029
social behavior

277
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:36,250
and in development

278
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,550
we also see

279
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,790
the same kind of interaction

280
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,059
when we come to understand mental
illness

281
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,200
as a product of the interaction

282
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,600
of going out this is

283
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,170
and stress factors

284
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:49,830
biological

285
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,550
and psychosocial

286
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,279
factors

287
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,790
doesn't even individual vulnerable

288
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,040
to some form of mental illness

289
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,270
then interrupt

290
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,570
with biological and social events in the
environment

291
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,339
bom

292
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:04,950
determine

293
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:09,300
whether somebody is going to have an
episode of mental illness

294
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,500
or not

295
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,959
in the same way

296
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:16,400
that gina types are decisive for
personality

297
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,830
in the same way at the genotypes are
decisive

298
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,800
for development

299
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,540
genotypes aren't decisive for mental
illness or either

300
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,030
what's important again

301
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:32,700
is there not shared environment the
individual experiences that will

302
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,180
interact

303
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,770
the jet vidya out this is factors
including genetic factors

304
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,839
to determine

305
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,680
whether somebody is going to have

306
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,230
an episode of mental illness all or not

307
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,950
one of the great achievements of
psychology over the last twenty thirty

308
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,930
years

309
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,860
has been the development although a
large number of

310
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,910
dragons other medications

311
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,820
that can be used too

312
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,100
treat mental illness

313
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,950
to alleviate some of the symptoms of
mental illness

314
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,079
but again

315
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,800
all these these drugs

316
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,509
as effective as a maybe

317
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:14,440
they do not them by themselves produce
cures form for mental illness

318
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,510
people can take drugs to get symptom
relief

319
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,500
but hong perhaps

320
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,249
do you know that the best tak

321
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:22,760
is to combine

322
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,080
a drug

323
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,519
with psychotherapy so that those two

324
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,179
agents of change can be allowed to
interact with each other

325
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:34,670
and magnifying each other's affects

326
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,590
finally to take us full circle

327
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,600
we know that the most effective forms of
psychotherapy

328
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,350
are both suck operate on

329
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,919
mental prostheses

330
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:48,679
the ones that cognitive-behavioral
psychotherapy is

331
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,029
the try to change

332
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:51,650
what people think

333
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,040
what people believe about themselves

334
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,800
how people

335
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,830
all re respond emotionally to various
events and so on

336
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,009
cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy is

337
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:05,170
the focus on the here in though

338
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,920
stead of their and then over early
childhood

339
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,819
cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy is

340
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:13,330
the teacher person whose skills

341
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,460
helpful person gain new knowledge

342
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,690
or the

343
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,919
all forms of psychotherapy

344
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,710
that dog that really beverly work and
again

345
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,889
bringing us full circle

346
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:25,889
if you want to

347
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,040
deal with

348
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,970
mental illness

349
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,870
you want to understand

350
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,449
how old the mentally ill or thinking

351
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,980
and perceiving the world

352
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,499
and try to change

353
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:39,200
those times of things

354
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,190
wireless emphasis on cognition

355
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:45,850
on the interaction between the person on
the environment the interactions between

356
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,180
genes and environment is the interaction
between dialysis and stress

357
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,829
mean that psychology

358
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:56,160
has to be a very broad science indeed

359
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,100
as a biological science

360
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,980
psychology has to be concerned with

361
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,180
such matters as how the brain works

362
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,809
howell

363
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:08,720
no prophecies interact with endocrine
prophecies

364
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,700
how on genetic

365
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,459
prophecies

366
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,610
all unfold to interact with the
environment to create the individual

367
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,839
bought psychology has to be not just a
biological science

368
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,410
but also a social science

369
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,890
won the tries to understand

370
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,450
harlequin workings of the individual
mine

371
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,470
interact

372
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,510
the workings of the

373
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,640
also c l_ cultural environment outside
the individual

374
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,380
have have to understand not just the
biological substrates of mine but we

375
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,080
also have to understand

376
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,740
the socio-cultural

377
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,730
or context of mine

378
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,490
in the context of biology but one thing
we know for sure

379
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,340
is that whatever's going on in the
borrowing the brain is the physical

380
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,640
basis of it

381
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,379
combined is what the brain dogs

382
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:05,550
and we're now in a position with new
brain imaging devices

383
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,880
to gain are much more sophisticated
understanding that we barely ever had

384
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,180
before

385
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,820
about

386
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,250
dog biar

387
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,830
the normal substrates

388
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:20,220
of what goes on argument in the mind the
biological substrates of cognition

389
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,780
we already know

390
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,100
that rather than being a single massive
oregon

391
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,529
the of the brain is highly specialized

392
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:33,019
with lots of specialized structures each
dedicated to performing

393
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:37,420
of various of the various psychological
tasks

394
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,239
this brain that we've got

395
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:41,550
it is a tremendous

396
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,450
legacy of biological evolution we've got
brains like no other creature on those

397
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,309
on earth

398
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:54,350
the wait our brains were shaped by a lot
by biological evolution has given us a

399
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,270
particular psychological legacy

400
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,750
first by virtue of our

401
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,679
brains

402
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:06,210
especially hard big cerebral cortex and
especially that big prefrontal cortex

403
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,450
we have this

404
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,570
huge

405
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,800
capacity for intelligence

406
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,460
them nor must capacity

407
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,960
to learn her about the world

408
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,119
members capacity to understand

409
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,200
the things that are going on

410
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,160
around us

411
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,860
evolution also gave us

412
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,970
unique capacity for language a capacity
that's not shared even by our closest

413
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,980
evolutionary relatives like chimpanzees

414
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:39,350
first language gives us an
extraordinarily powerful way of

415
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,810
symbolically representing boggy of the
world

416
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,020
but also language gives us

417
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,870
an extraordinarily powerful way of
communicating

418
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,130
with each other

419
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,890
sharing with each other

420
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,950
or what uh... what we know

421
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,240
sharing with each other

422
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,100
what's going on what's going on in our
minds

423
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,529
and then finally

424
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:01,470
all of the evolution of the brain

425
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,810
has given us

426
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,770
currently are an enormous capacity for
consciousness

427
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,370
the capacity to

428
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:14,470
of what's going on around us the
capacity to be aware of what's going

429
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:20,110
through our minds and the capacity to
deliberately control

430
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,060
our thoughts

431
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,669
farts emotions

432
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:24,700
goals

433
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,980
and and our behaviors

434
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,960
in the context of culture

435
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,940
we get something else

436
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,800
all in the context of culture

437
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,259
we understand that

438
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:36,040
although

439
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,340
all of the human culture is itself a
product of the human mind without minds

440
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,440
can't be taught

441
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,490
can't be any meaningful culture

442
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:50,180
but each individual now has working by
virtue of being in a culture a set of

443
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,580
assumptions

444
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,309
that paul got that that he or she has
concerning

445
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:57,810
ourselves and the universe

446
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,549
we get from culture

447
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,500
a set of categories

448
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,220
that we used to organize our
understanding of of the world

449
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,410
we get on history

450
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,029
of the

451
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:15,990
triumphs and errors of all previous
generations

452
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,480
beget institutions like schools

453
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,249
and universities

454
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:25,360
and churches and synagogues and temples
for preserving art though that the

455
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,799
heritage of the past

456
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,029
and transmitting it

457
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:30,820
to out to do it too

458
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,520
toot regeneration

459
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,760
we got a series of rewards and
punishments

460
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,600
by which

461
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,530
the culture and poses itself

462
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,790
fine the individual

463
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:45,130
and we get tradition of philosophy

464
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,350
and literature and art

465
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,500
that we can use to imagine

466
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,510
how things might be different

467
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,419
and to try to or make that imagine that
that imagine difference

468
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,380
or com real

469
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,230
when you think about now

470
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,500
came to be told

471
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,240
what the brain damaged the brain being a
product of evolution

472
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,660
and ninety creating the possibility of
culture

473
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,700
you begin to appreciate that there is
something also a paradox

474
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,570
on going on here

475
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,770
which is that mind which in turn is a
product of the brain

476
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,970
creates the possibility of culture

477
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,410
it's our conscious awareness of what
we're thinking

478
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,989
and their ability to use the language

479
00:22:30,989 --> 00:22:34,029
to transmit our thoughts to what other
people

480
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:36,210
that's the psychological bases

481
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,170
of human culture

482
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,930
but human culture

483
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,130
also evolves

484
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,740
the individual learns

485
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,789
and the culture evolves

486
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:49,390
at a rate that is much faster

487
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,910
than biological

488
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,020
or evolution

489
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,320
we are for all intents and purposes

490
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,470
the same creatures our ancestors were
five ten thousand years ago

491
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,940
but in terms of

492
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,830
culture we are very very different
creatures

493
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,470
on entirely

494
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,370
what happened what this means

495
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,490
is that to some extent

496
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:16,620
minded which is a product of evolution
has given us the ability to transcend

497
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,659
biological evolution

498
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:21,140
we're no longer simply products of
natural selection

499
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,600
but we have the ability to make

500
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,560
ourselves

501
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,649
to change ourselves

502
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:30,100
and make ourselves

503
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,760
creatures club that we are

504
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,520
so in the final analysis

505
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,830
mind is the bases

506
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,160
for human freedom

507
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:45,030
or minds allow us to transcend whatever
happened in the past

508
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,679
biologically

509
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,480
or historically

510
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,730
our minds

511
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,139
give us the capacity

512
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:54,340
to transform the president to think
about things

513
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,500
new ways and therefore take

514
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,950
different kinds of actions

515
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,659
than we ordinarily would

516
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:06,000
and also to make our own futures by
transmitting what we know and what we're

517
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,890
thinking

518
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,130
to other people and two other
generations

519
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:16,600
so by using our minds we can change
ourselves and the world around us

520
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,020
make ourselves and the world around us

521
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,110
even better

522
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,840
but we can do this

523
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,119
only if we do have a great strides to do
in the first place

524
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:34,540
button that themselves to examine or old
wives and the lives of those around us

525
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,440
this is ultimately

526
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,840
the important task of psychology

527
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,559
to wonder stand how our minds work

528
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:45,700
and how we can use our minds in the
service of human adaptation

529
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,100
for the geo size

530
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,640
and for myself that's what psychology is
all about and it's been our pleasure to

531
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,039
introduce this field to you

532
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,980
the semester

533
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,370
thank you very much
