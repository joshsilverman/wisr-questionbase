1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,779
okay every girl

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,829
are you may recall we had an exam last
week

3
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:15,449
thanks to the geoscience for taking care
of the review session and the exam

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,819
itself in my absence

5
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:19,880
when we restored the system

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,189
we identified four items statistically
that word that items that is bad for

7
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,109
whatever reason it doesn't matter what
reason

8
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:28,810
on

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,230
items thirty five forty forty seven
forty nine

10
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:36,530
and that we do when we identified that
item is that we re score

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,150
that items correct for all responses

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,840
so if you what you are

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,570
answers alcohol in the preliminary
scoring ki

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,330
and you found that you got any of these
items wrong

15
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,520
you've now got a right

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,870
okay so give yourself one point for each
item art that you got wrong

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,910
and that's your final exam score

18
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,590
we won't be restored any other items ok
we used

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,500
objective statistical analysis

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,229
to identify items that uh... that are
bad

21
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:10,119
i've almost finished entering a grade
still be finished by noon today

22
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,330
and you can check your grades are posted
on splint

23
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,550
volatile has to

24
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,660
how would two

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,000
uh... reconcile any discrepancies

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,960
that you may have

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,160
encountered

28
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,429
here's what the distribution of
performance looks like

29
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:27,919
usually when i teach this class the
average score an exam is somewhere

30
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:31,060
between sixty five and seventy percent
correct

31
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,910
which i think is pretty good

32
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,830
on the means whoever this class was

33
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,939
considerably better than that which i
think is

34
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:41,860
all of this is the distribution

35
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,290
average score thirty eight point three
three which is roughly seventy seven

36
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,970
percent

37
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,650
home

38
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,190
when you get this nice little
distribution here

39
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,950
model with mostly scorers ranging
between thirty five

40
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,920
thirty five and forty points

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,680
i'm not too many

42
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
appear

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,780
not too many

44
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,729
down there

45
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,470
pretty good distribution matic not quite
a normal distribution but

46
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,319
we don't expect the normal distribution
we expect the discussion that's

47
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,430
towards the high-end

48
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,419
anyway all all will be

49
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:16,269
unclear were

50
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,239
well i have tried post the scores are
going to go back to pose some more

51
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,059
feedback on the exam

52
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:24,190
and then if anybody has any questions
about any of the items that

53
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,699
has not been addressed by the feedback

54
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:29,540
are just post those questions for me

55
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,719
website forum

56
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,129
and will deal with them

57
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,469
any quick questions about

58
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:43,359
anything at all

59
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:44,509
i hear

60
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:48,259
i have been avoided any other way but
yes that's right

61
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:50,109
this is the restored

62
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:53,900
mean in medium

63
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,189
okay

64
00:02:55,189 --> 00:02:59,909
in the course so far once we got past
they even added me in that through the

65
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:02,499
allergy in the function of the nervous
system

66
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:06,959
we began to take up particular
psychological functions

67
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,829
function of learning and the function of
perception

68
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:14,509
and one of its points

69
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:16,430
i think

70
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,049
should've gotten across

71
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:22,019
is that both learning the agm perceiving

72
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:23,759
end on memory

73
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,970
and both learning and proceeding if you
think about it for a second

74
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,229
change memory

75
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:33,779
we think about learning as a relatively
permanent change in knowledge that

76
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:36,379
occurs as a result of experience

77
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:41,180
and it's the capacity for memory that
all of our knowledge to be permanent

78
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,879
changed we have to have some mechanism
for retaining

79
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,259
what we've learned to through or through
experience

80
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,519
on november

81
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,299
if you think about these sources of
information for perception

82
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,479
in the u_k_ in gibson's ecological of
your perception there's information that

83
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,929
comes from the stimulus environment
that's all impact by the perceptual

84
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:02,769
apparatus

85
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,959
and then barriers

86
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,199
knowledge beliefs expectations and stan
and all sorts of things stored in the

87
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,179
memory of the perceive ur which combines
with stimulus information

88
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:18,959
in the process of constructing the
mental representation or p_r_ of the

89
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,329
distal stimulus

90
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,479
warning depends on memory obviously

91
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,449
perception not quite so obviously also
depends on perception

92
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:31,000
but it's also the case

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,569
that memory changes depending upon what
you proceed

94
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:40,680
that perceptual activity changes the
contents of the memory system

95
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,460
so that there is some lasting trace

96
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,190
of what you've experienced

97
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,069
what we sometimes call

98
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:50,250
an anagram sobel piece of technical
jargon

99
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,070
in the study of memory a memory trace

100
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,240
that persists after the experience is
over

101
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,689
that'll wallace odd that experience to
continue to influence

102
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:03,730
experience thought and action after the
stimulus

103
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,779
has some has disappeared

104
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:09,240
so in a very important sounds

105
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,699
memory is the

106
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,340
cognitive function of stories knowledge
that we've acquired

107
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,279
through learning and perception

108
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,889
but also memory is important because

109
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:25,590
memory freeze our behavior from
controlled by the president's stimulus

110
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,229
environment

111
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,879
if you didn't have memory all you'd be
able to do is to react to whatever's

112
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,319
currently in the the environment now
whatever it is that you're experiencing

113
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,539
but memory

114
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,749
allows us to respond to

115
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:40,030
past events

116
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,679
as well as events in the current
stimulus and barman

117
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:46,880
and memory are also gives us the means
to reflect

118
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,580
on our experiences

119
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,370
also the week so that

120
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,960
uh... we've

121
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,389
plan for

122
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,569
for future encounters

123
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:00,889
so memory is the psychologists is a
psychological storehouse of knowledge

124
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:05,330
let's look for a quick call for a moment
at the kinds of knowledge that stored in

125
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,409
memory

126
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:10,899
in cognitive psychology we've gone make
a couple of distinctions about the kinds

127
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:12,580
of knowledge stored in memory

128
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,270
the first of these distinctions

129
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,210
is a distinction between declarative
knowledge on the one hand

130
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,709
and procedural knowledge of on the other

131
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:25,999
declarative knowledge is the technical
term that we give

132
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:28,749
factual knowledge of all sorts

133
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:33,189
any kind of factual knowledge it's a
fact that automobiles have four wheels

134
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:38,430
and run on gasoline or diesel oil it's a
fact that bicycles had two wheels

135
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,060
it's a fact that i had chicken for
dinner last night it's a fact that i was

136
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,349
in vienna on friday those are all facts
about the world the reader true or not

137
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,900
true

138
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,379
that factual knowledge

139
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:53,360
is what we call declarative knowledge

140
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,830
by contrast

141
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,960
we have another category of knowledge
that's known as procedural knowledge

142
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,200
which consists i am

143
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,009
the directions for goal directed action

144
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,269
directions for goal directed action

145
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:10,260
if i were wearing loafers today

146
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,650
but if i had twice shoes on and i one of
the time i shoes

147
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,240
the procedure for time shows

148
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,390
primer shoelaces

149
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,939
is a piece of procedural knowledge

150
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,080
are those of you who noted politics
square roots without using a calculator

151
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,879
that mathematical procedure is part of
your procedural knowledge

152
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,110
your knowledge of the rules of

153
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,989
english grammar or spanish or chinese
grammar

154
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:34,919
or whatever language you know

155
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,710
all those also pieces of coal

156
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,409
pieces of procedural knowledge

157
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:43,849
so we think this fundamental distinction
between

158
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:45,059
and rules

159
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:48,020
declarative knowledge had procedural
knowledge

160
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,789
and then

161
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:52,690
we begin to think about other kinds of
things

162
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,089
one where all the way of thinking about
this

163
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:56,669
all claret of knowledge

164
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:00,930
can be stored in sentence like
structures that consist of

165
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,110
a subject

166
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,360
boverb and an object

167
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,519
alright had chicken for dinner

168
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,459
our columbus discovered america

169
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:14,139
somtime five hundred years ago tommorrow
or whatever all declarative knowledge

170
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:17,509
can be represented in sentence form

171
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:21,139
procedural knowledge has a somewhat
different format it has a format that we

172
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:22,630
call productions

173
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,779
and productions have a kind of yes then
the quality to it

174
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:32,430
suppose you're driving a standard shift
kar and you want to get it moving

175
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,040
forward

176
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,510
what you have to do is you have to

177
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,049
ship i'll put the car into first year

178
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,619
and the way you do that is

179
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,480
if you're sitting in the driver's seat
you press down on the clutch

180
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,010
one superstar in the clutch

181
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,940
you shift in the first

182
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,980
then if you've shifted into force

183
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,720
then you let up on the clutch while
simultaneously pressing down on the gas

184
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,660
pedal

185
00:08:53,660 --> 00:09:00,080
visa rules for driving a standard shift
kar and they can albee represented in in

186
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,059
spend format

187
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:05,140
that specifies some glow

188
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,850
and salem action

189
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,650
that will achieve the goal under certain
kinds of conditions

190
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,769
if you want to drive a standard shift
kar

191
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,220
than the first thing you do

192
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,600
is pressed down on the clutch and so on

193
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,290
this procedural knowledge takes through
broad forums

194
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,110
our first of these are motor procedures

195
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,389
where the actions that are performed the
actions that are governed by the rule

196
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:32,290
take the form of some kind of over
behavior

197
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,160
okay if i want to time i sure lace is
the first thing i have to do was pull

198
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,840
them tighten and cross them over

199
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,769
alm

200
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:41,110
and what these minor procedures do

201
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:47,309
is alter the objective publicly
observable state of the world

202
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:51,529
after i performed at first action my
shoelaces are crossed when they work

203
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,250
before that's something that they were
everybody could see

204
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,430
it simply objectively true

205
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:02,170
but these mental procedures ok alm the
bar codes of mental procedures are used

206
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,249
to

207
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:07,880
called dodd govern perception and memory
they take the form of a

208
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,910
mental transformation if i save you
what's

209
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,200
three divided by e_r_ too

210
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,960
and you say one and a half you haven't
changed the objective world in any way

211
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,540
what you've done is we've taken

212
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,170
your mental representation of three

213
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,880
divided by two when you've got one and a
half in your head what these mental

214
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,949
procedures do

215
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:32,100
is to alter the subjective

216
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,180
private

217
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,970
mental state of affairs

218
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,360
alter your alternative

219
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,439
you motion will

220
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,860
or motivational states so we have first
in this hierarchical classification of

221
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,570
knowledge

222
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,040
a distinction between declarative and
procedural knowledge

223
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,860
then two kinds procedural knowledge
motor procedures and mental procedures

224
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,890
similarly

225
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,790
we have two types also

226
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,020
part of knowledge

227
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,510
the first of these recall episodic
knowledge

228
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,050
and at this is essentially
autobiographical memory

229
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:09,020
at a sonic knowledge of his knowledge of
eve instead of occurred at a particular

230
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,650
place and a particular time

231
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,530
each event

232
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,460
is associated with a unique

233
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:20,019
in the space and time but you can think
about autobiographical memory

234
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:21,750
as factual knowledge

235
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,499
about your personal experiences

236
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:26,829
it's a fact that i had chicken for
dinner last night it's a fact that i

237
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:29,200
graduated from colgate university

238
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,840
it's a fact that i was raised in process
network those are all facts about me

239
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,370
by the same token

240
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,540
uh... we have or other kinds of
procedural knowledge

241
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,600
that aren't really facts about events

242
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,750
bible reader but rather are more
abstract or conceptual all of the in

243
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,690
nature

244
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,500
and this is what we call semantic
knowledge

245
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,930
and semantic knowledge constitutes what
kind of mental dictionary if you will or

246
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,900
mental encyclopedia

247
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,190
that retains knowledge

248
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,730
although the abstract conceptual form

249
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,149
that doesn't really have anything to do
with our personal experiences

250
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:09,550
i know what a chicken is

251
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,330
okay

252
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,890
and that now that knowledge of what a
check and it is

253
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,560
has nothing to do with the fact that i a
chicken for dinner last night

254
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,220
although i don't cut it

255
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,330
what's on television on sunday nights
and that has nothing to do with what

256
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,259
alliance might what on myself

257
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:27,720
might have thought might have watched so
we have this distinction

258
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,310
between episodic and semantic forms

259
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,650
of declarative knowledge

260
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,119
in these lectures

261
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:37,100
we're going to focus on episodic memory

262
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,629
we're going to focus on

263
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,440
hot what is that we remember

264
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,500
you dance and experiences

265
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,880
the carter was

266
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,420
at a particular point

267
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,420
in space and time

268
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,319
we'll talk about semantic knowledgeable
talk about procedural knowledge a little

269
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:52,570
bit later on

270
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,610
when we talk about clogged and language

271
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,799
for the purposes of these lectures

272
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:00,940
we're going to just we're going to
define memory as

273
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,000
episodic memory

274
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,760
autobiographical memory memory for

275
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,510
the things that people have experienced

276
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,210
and the people's mother and the things
that people have dawn

277
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,599
and a most of the study of memory

278
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:19,240
or at least forward the first hundred
years of this study

279
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,410
focused on

280
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,370
all the kind of the opposite

281
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,500
of the question of memory and that is

282
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,570
the question of forgetting

283
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,390
what causes us to forget the things that
we've forgotten

284
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,350
and we

285
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,199
are credited for from our knowledge of
the rules of forgetting

286
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:40,520
all harwood is that we remember the
things that we remember

287
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,820
usually we all understand remembering
and forgetting

288
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,410
events

289
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,480
in terms of at least three stage model
of memory

290
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,040
that distinguishes along

291
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,060
and encoding stage

292
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,730
by which

293
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,070
a trace

294
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,840
some experiences

295
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,550
encoded in memory or laid down in memory

296
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,899
of storage

297
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:02,369
days

298
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:03,319
by which

299
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,830
that new memory is retained

300
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,340
in storage

301
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,740
and a retrieval

302
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,720
onstage

303
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,730
by which

304
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:15,680
that's stored information is brought
back into argues in some way

305
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,819
so here we have

306
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:18,509
these three stages

307
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,110
in memory processing

308
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,700
and encoding onstage with volley the
story of a memory trace

309
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,890
this is

310
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,079
typically thought of as a byproduct of
perceptual activity

311
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,290
and the general ideas a perceptual
activity

312
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,380
leaves in memory

313
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,230
selma representation

314
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,390
some trains of what's

315
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,110
been proceed

316
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,039
then

317
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,950
storage the storage phase

318
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,450
has to do with the retention obvious
memory trace

319
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:48,920
farm

320
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,209
so that it's available for use

321
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:54,950
but it's not necessarily something that
you're thinking about all the time

322
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,720
might not always thinking about the fact
that i had chicken for dinner last night

323
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,840
and not always thinking about the fact

324
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,790
but i was born in processing your

325
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,429
but when i turn my mind to it by flying
that piece of knowledge okay

326
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:08,529
on that

327
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,850
that knowledge is our venerable even if
it's not right in my heart the forefront

328
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,330
of my consciousness at any point

329
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,280
but then

330
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,029
through to retrieval process

331
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:20,459
what we do is we recall ever

332
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,330
in some way

333
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,660
information that's been in coded and
stored in memory

334
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,130
so that we can use that for various
kinds of purposes like if somebody came

335
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:34,740
up to me on the street and said what am
for dinner last night

336
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,020
aiken searched my memory of the car and
that was funded remember what that

337
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,410
sunday's took a day

338
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,339
or so

339
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,850
what we do is somehow we activate that
late knowledge

340
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,329
gain access to available not lage

341
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,520
so that we can offer make use of it in
one way or another

342
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,380
we're going to do in these factors as
we're going to go through these pages

343
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,009
intern

344
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:58,550
and show you how they work

345
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,760
what the principles or that involves
under that are involved in the sayings

346
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,490
but the basic point for now

347
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,560
is to understand that any particular
instance of forgetting

348
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,270
cannonball by failure

349
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:16,040
at any all of these three stages of
memory processing

350
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,250
either acting alone

351
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,130
or in combination

352
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,600
so that you might forget an event
because you failed to uncover the memory

353
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,670
trace of that event to begin with

354
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,690
nothing gets in

355
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,930
you're never going to be able to
remember it okay

356
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,919
or perhaps u_n_ coated the memory trays

357
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,790
but for some reason

358
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,210
that race was lost from storage knocked
out of storage

359
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,509
or perhaps the uncoated traces is stored

360
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:45,410
but for one reason or another

361
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,160
you can't retrieve

362
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,590
the home

363
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,410
the land and stored the storage race

364
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:57,030
always some combination of incoming
storage and retrieval factors

365
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,259
view love the causes of forgetting

366
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:03,339
if you think about it for seconds kind
of analogous to elaborate okay

367
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:07,660
you've got a lot of radha look for a
book and you don't find it

368
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,150
and you have a library for a while we
don't own that book

369
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,289
okay librarian

370
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:14,449
never in coated that book the report on
the shelves

371
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,730
or the librarian might say well we
bought that book a long time ago with

372
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,930
somebody stole that were in fact

373
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,670
it or something like that

374
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,459
it's been lost its not on the shelves
anymore all

375
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:31,120
or you might find that it's actually
then purchased

376
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,130
put on the shelf pareshaan for the wrong
place

377
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:38,050
if i block has been stored in the
library order then where it's supposed

378
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,700
to be are now that i find it

379
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,290
still there but you're never going to be
able to retrieve that information

380
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:50,200
this library metaphor of memory is not
quite right for reasons all talk about

381
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,120
next monday

382
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,559
but it will take you all lonely and
understanding

383
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,020
the prophecies by which we incurred
information memory

384
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,140
retain it in memory storage and retrieve
it when we want to get at it

385
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,290
later on

386
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,190
sahai study memory use all based on this
three stage model

387
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:14,250
but typical way in which psychologist
study memory is by use of what we call

388
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,980
the bronco learning paradigm

389
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,249
apparently was invented long ago

390
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:21,519
all volume which still

391
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:24,070
dominates the study of memory

392
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,970
what we do in a verbal warning
experiment is that there are really

393
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,720
three different phases

394
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,550
there is first a study phase

395
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:37,670
analogous to the encoding the stage of
memory processing

396
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,769
and what we do in this and in this our
study phase

397
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:45,669
is we've simply present to the subject
analyst stalled for millie or words and

398
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:48,700
ask them to do something with that made
we actually ask the person

399
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,960
to memorize the list of words

400
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,160
it's important that the words be already
familiar to the subject because of a

401
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,340
teaching you know words

402
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,430
what's that

403
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,430
that semantic memory i mean large in
your mental dictionary right

404
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,400
but if i present your word you already
know

405
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,520
your task is to remember what the word
what is that you remember to add a

406
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,539
particular time

407
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:15,580
the event

408
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,960
but would not be the event that you
remembering

409
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,420
is a print is a presentation all of a
particular word

410
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,590
and it will be called as the boarding
paradigm because a classically involves

411
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:25,970
words

412
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,230
but you could use anything that could be
pictures are copies smells it could be

413
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,240
stories that could be videos

414
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,560
anything you want to do

415
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,900
in the process is still the same

416
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,910
south after the subjects had an
opportunity to study some material a

417
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,170
list of words for example

418
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,960
then we move into the retention phase

419
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,950
which it is intended to capture the
process season memory storage

420
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,350
and what we might do then

421
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,549
as the person to retain that information

422
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:57,710
for a more or less long period of time

423
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:04,000
or we might present the person was some
kind of distracting partner task

424
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,910
then you could start in these lectures

425
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,480
armed

426
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,700
we want to

427
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,570
we want to focus on what's known as
long-term memory

428
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,170
memory for information

429
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,630
out to the person's attention has been
distracted from it

430
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,190
it doesn't have to be really long term

431
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,440
instant experimental psychology
long-term memories that anything after

432
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,210
about thirty seconds

433
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,710
or short term memory

434
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,090
is probably best

435
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,190
all represented

436
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,059
by the memory that you have

437
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:36,899
for information a telephone book you
want to look up somebody's phone number

438
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:38,950
you go to phone book you look at all

439
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,780
when you try to keep in mind while
you're dialing the phone

440
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,009
that's short term memory we're not
interested

441
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,220
in these lectures

442
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,290
we're just in long-term memory

443
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,080
remembering your

444
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,500
sophomore year in high school boyfriend
or girlfriend phone number

445
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,639
oh or the phone number of somebody that
you met

446
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:56,649
last friday night

447
00:20:56,649 --> 00:20:57,740
or whatever

448
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,200
and then finally

449
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,410
uh... we had the test phase

450
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,850
after there's been some encoding

451
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,669
after the material is

452
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:08,220
billion memory storage for a while

453
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,869
then we asked the person some kind of
question

454
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:15,760
all of that requires him or her to make
use of that newly stored knowledge

455
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,020
that is the retrieval all phase

456
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,540
and that usually consist

457
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,340
of various kinds bulb all various kinds
of memory tests

458
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,909
okay so let's just throat gothic
procedure onto a quick example of this

459
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:31,160
going to show you a list of familiar
words

460
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,070
and what i want to do is to repeat each
one intern just

461
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,880
do-it-yourself after i read it

462
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,409
after i've read the entire list i'll
give you a three digit number

463
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:44,160
but i want to do is to take that number
subtract seven from that

464
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,159
then from that difference seven again
seven again seven again

465
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:48,870
until

466
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,390
on a tell you

467
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,930
here are the words

468
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,840
anger

469
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,780
brad

470
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,820
just do it yourself cold

471
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,890
grow old

472
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,240
ang

473
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,290
mountain

474
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,440
needle

475
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,930
slow

476
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,240
spider

477
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,980
now takes seven sixty three

478
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,610
subtract seven from that

479
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,390
subtract seven again

480
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,860
seventy m

481
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,370
seven again

482
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,010
and in just keep going until i tell you
to stall

483
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,820
another seven

484
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,240
another seven

485
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,480
another seven

486
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,590
another seven

487
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,370
now we'd ask you do just right down the
words that were on the list

488
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,420
you know i can turn this in

489
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,440
and those of you a print out the slides
can just look at them

490
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,970
that's called cheating

491
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,420
anyway there is the list okay

492
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,410
the point is

493
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,900
you've been kind of these words every
one of these words was familiar to you

494
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,760
before you enter the class

495
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,399
and what we're asking to do is to
remember warm words we presented what

496
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:28,070
words you experienced at a particular
time in a particular place and you

497
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,929
probably got five or six of these on
average maybe seven

498
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:32,990
all if your

499
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,010
girl if you're really paying attention

500
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,360
but that's how this kind of expert
that's how this experience girls

501
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,860
so we could ask gum lots of different
memory tests

502
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,190
what words just study just remember all
the words on the list

503
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,980
or we could ask you a more specific
question

504
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,400
whenever the words of are on the outside
of the screen

505
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,730
over the words on the right side of the
screen

506
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,539
what were the words were printed in blue

507
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,790
what were the words that were printed in
red

508
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:05,060
was there a word on there that's the
name of an animal

509
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,710
on it if there was an animal name was
its spider or snake these are all the

510
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,750
kinds of ways

511
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,280
in which we contest

512
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,799
ust a person's memory

513
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,620
for something that he or she

514
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,380
has studied

515
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,550
so again

516
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,010
the idea here but the bravo learning
paradigms which is

517
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,789
what we're going to talk about for the
next couple of days

518
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:28,150
is that need to list of words

519
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:33,050
and each word on each list represents an
episode of experience

520
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,580
and in memory research

521
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,300
but we tried to do is to very the
conditions of study

522
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,140
retention

523
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,580
and testing

524
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,940
very the conditions of encoding

525
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,250
storage and retrieval

526
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,880
so that we can figure out what
principles are governed

527
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,980
each of these processes

528
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:55,510
and then what we do is we observed the
effects of each of these manipulations

529
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,059
on the person's or memory

530
00:24:58,059 --> 00:24:59,840
for the list of words

531
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,180
so

532
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,380
what are we discover

533
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,289
the first thing we do

534
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:09,830
all of this to try to on understand how
weird is that we encode information in

535
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,660
memory

536
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,000
so for the purposes of this discussion

537
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,370
just assume those subjects perceived an
object or event study to work

538
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,050
earlier list of words

539
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,710
and then what we want to know is

540
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:25,299
how does a mental representation of that
event

541
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:26,640
once perceived

542
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,260
get stored in memory

543
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,350
the classical

544
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,940
also all

545
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,560
answer to this question

546
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:41,350
is that information gets stored in
memory as a function of of rehearsal

547
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,020
on the idea here izzat memories a
product of perception

548
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,990
the more you do to rehearse that
information

549
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,860
on the better your memory will be

550
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,000
if you look up a telephone number

551
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,440
and you think of it over and over and
over to yourself time after time after

552
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,520
time

553
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,379
then the idea is that you all remember

554
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:03,230
that telephone number better you won't
have to look it up

555
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:03,940
again

556
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,380
we've encountered this principle before

557
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,760
if remember our discussion of
thorndike's law is level learning we

558
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,180
read again remember that one of four
nights big laws was the law of exercise

559
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,690
weary thought that

560
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,669
stimulus response associations were
strengthened

561
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:23,830
through use and weakened

562
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,230
disuse

563
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,030
the general idea behind the importance
of rehearsal

564
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,800
and this is something that was studied
even before thorndike came around

565
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:39,480
five a german psychologist on ninad
adding house all who's part that

566
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,909
albright purcell was so important in
memory

567
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:47,520
that the uh... enshrined it as one of
his fundamental all fundamental laws

568
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,870
here it is what had been hosted

569
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:54,310
at a house and then took a particular
paradigm and for the study of memory

570
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,870
known as the nonsense syllable paradigm

571
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,790
he wasn't interested in the words

572
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,280
he wasn't interested in stories are
pictures or anything like that

573
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,960
he asked the all to well eoc actually he
was is on subjects old yest insult

574
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,800
to study

575
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,400
the most

576
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,400
meaningless material you can imagine

577
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,610
he constructed syllables consisting of a
confident of all of the constant

578
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,360
music also involve concentrate grams

579
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,190
remember he was german have no meaning
in german

580
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,790
all words like that

581
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,030
brought syllables like dad

582
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,880
jacks

583
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,660
marble

584
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,470
tab and wall

585
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,559
ania somewhat hundreds of thousands of
these

586
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,080
on and then conspired gather them into
lists actually of his valet

587
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,610
gather them into all this

588
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,980
alms and then he tried to memorize

589
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,309
these lists of nonsense syllables

590
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:49,720
instructs the real work

591
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,620
so we'd recognise memorize dilution

592
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,990
followed by jack's

593
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,129
followed by marble

594
00:27:55,129 --> 00:27:56,529
fall a bike have

595
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:59,360
followed by wall

596
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,690
are you may think of this is completely
boring which forest it is

597
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,380
all

598
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,050
evian houses

599
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,020
method

600
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,710
juarez

601
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,730
given to him buying another principle
dewitt study in the context of learning

602
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,300
this was a time insight that that
psychology was dominated by the

603
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,060
principle of association by continuity

604
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,659
so every most thought

605
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,030
that associations will be formed

606
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:30,210
between nonsense syllables that occurred
close together in time you get an

607
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,680
association between dash in jax

608
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,630
another one between jackson mob another
one between marvin have

609
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:43,260
maybe a week or association between dash
and mall but between jackson ten and a

610
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,100
very weak association

611
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,789
between dash in-wall

612
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:49,350
because welder just not is configured

613
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:55,139
so that was the idea and puttin up in
the traditional estar framework

614
00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:56,610
ambient house view would

615
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,600
ought to have had the view that you
choose

616
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,519
nonsense syllable

617
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:04,830
with four of us ten dollars for the next
month in seoul

618
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,570
which would in turn be or response

619
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,100
to the nonsense syllable that went
before it

620
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,179
and what he did in one of his
experiments

621
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:16,089
is simply buried a number of repetitions

622
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:19,240
the number of times he worked his way

623
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,340
through this list

624
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,400
one-time two times five times ten times
whatever

625
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,450
and then after a standard retention
interval

626
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,590
twenty four hours in the case of eddie
house

627
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,770
he would then try to reproduce the list
verbatim

628
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:39,220
so we very the condition of encoding the
number of repetitions

629
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,160
held the retention interval constant

630
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,220
and then

631
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,889
had simple test

632
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:49,340
of all basically savings in relearning
as he tried to memorize the list again

633
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,519
and four how fast it went

634
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,360
here is that the house is dead

635
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,810
we have

636
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,300
brand new list of the zero prior
repetitions eight sixteen twenty four

637
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,000
all multiples of

638
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,480
here so

639
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:03,970
on

640
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,419
and this is the amount of time it took
him to memorize

641
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:08,820
that is to relearn

642
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,549
each of these lists with a brand new
list they took him some twelve thirteen

643
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:16,309
hundred seconds okay what's at twenty
minutes

644
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:18,560
onto to memorize the list

645
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,270
but if the list that already had eight
repetitions of took her last time

646
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,480
to reword it

647
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,700
if the listed had forty-two repetitions

648
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,549
less time

649
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,899
if the listed had sixty four

650
00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:30,330
repetitions

651
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,190
it ok even less time

652
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,150
so here

653
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,210
memory

654
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,520
measured in terms of retention

655
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,169
varies as a function of the number of
times the list was repeated

656
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:44,730
this is the data that supported

657
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,700
abby houses for screw all log memory

658
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,409
which is

659
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:50,640
the law of repetition

660
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,610
and if a wall that is completely
consistent with the way

661
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,580
all associations reviewed at the time as
associations

662
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,190
based on principle

663
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:05,310
kon tiki woody all been strengthened
through australians

664
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,090
okay

665
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,490
so that's fine

666
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,759
and that lol remained pretty much in
place

667
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,929
for almost all hundred years

668
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:18,100
until two canadian psychologists fordice
craig and michael walk-ins

669
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,230
formed the following very interesting
experiment

670
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,720
they presented subjects with a list of
familiar words

671
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,190
and they ask them to do very simple task

672
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,400
all of us objects had to do

673
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,519
was to be prepared to report

674
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,200
the most recent word that began with the
letter

675
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,739
key is in peter

676
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:41,080
okay that's all you had to do

677
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,779
so you couldn't subjects with a big nor
all the words

678
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,850
that didn't begin with the

679
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:50,500
and once i know word appear at the
beginning of the letter p

680
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,029
they could forget the ordeal

681
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:55,730
sold what rock rake and while black
instead

682
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,380
west a very the amount

683
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,010
of rehearsal given to each word

684
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,719
and then as subjects to recall all the
words they had seen

685
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,580
here's how the expert on the web

686
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,969
first were on the list might be keys it
begins with p

687
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:11,730
so the subject has to be prepared to
report

688
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,330
next words chair

689
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,310
connect nora dot word

690
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,490
that's where the list is potato

691
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,080
person can now drop keys

692
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,570
from memory

693
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,310
and

694
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,050
potato

695
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,810
eg

696
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,460
window

697
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,610
forget the tail now all you have to do
is

698
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,480
the most recent keyword

699
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,059
radio

700
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:36,559
spiral

701
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,970
here's position forget punch remember
position

702
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,740
parking

703
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,909
forget position

704
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:44,420
remember party

705
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,300
notice that there are different numbers
off

706
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,880
neutral words

707
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,909
interspersed among these critical words

708
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:53,490
and this is basically how creko watkins

709
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,580
tried to control repetition

710
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,549
peas

711
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:59,340
that's one repetition of a reversal

712
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,169
potato gets four

713
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:03,509
gets three

714
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:04,680
position

715
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,200
one repetition and so on soap i come
watkins then dead

716
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,950
was to plot

717
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:11,539
retention

718
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:14,869
in terms of the subjects ability to
recall the words

719
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:17,530
as a function of the number of
repetitions

720
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,260
and here's what they got

721
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,200
nothing like what i've been how scott

722
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,380
ambient house got us straight

723
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,420
negative curve

724
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,429
dot showing

725
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:29,770
oscar clearer

726
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:33,610
all relationship between our repetition
and memory

727
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,529
but in the cricket walk-ins list

728
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:40,419
you can see that items that god knows
repetitions remembered pretty much as

729
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:44,220
well as items that got three or sex
repetitions

730
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,899
items i got five repetitions were
remembered pretty well but items they've

731
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:51,529
got twelve repetitions work remember are
as well

732
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,679
there's really relationship

733
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,300
in this along

734
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,090
uh... in this experiment

735
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,620
between rehearsal

736
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,450
between repetition

737
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,780
and elem

738
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,799
and and memory

739
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,579
so we have a real contradiction

740
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:08,710
between the results of cricket watkins
on the one hand and the earlier www

741
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,410
results results almost ninety years
before

742
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,039
all by and it helps

743
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,940
well how to explain this

744
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,190
i couldn't walk ins dot adele our
distinguished

745
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,809
between trudy types albright whistle

746
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:25,179
maintenance rehearsal and elaborate
rehearsal

747
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,259
if you think about it for a second

748
00:34:27,259 --> 00:34:30,079
makers rehearsal as just wrote rehearsal

749
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,200
and all it does is

750
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:32,649
maintain

751
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:35,229
and item fresh in memory

752
00:34:35,229 --> 00:34:36,589
if i ask you to recover

753
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:39,810
word product you save yourself product
product product product

754
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,200
and i think forget product remember
position

755
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,819
your figures opposition solution
position position

756
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:49,919
all you're doing is keeping that item
active involved in the home what we know

757
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,669
is short term memory

758
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:57,529
but there's a second time of repetition
or second type of rehearsal

759
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:01,220
evian that cricket watkins called all
that sort of a rehearsal

760
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,240
and that involves taking a night and
you're trying to remember

761
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,439
and linking that to orders things here
that you already no

762
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:11,579
okay

763
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:14,599
this allot started rehearsal strep

764
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:19,190
is a isn't encodes information in of
long-term memory

765
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,979
and if you think about it for a second

766
00:35:20,979 --> 00:35:24,859
when you're doing something like this
you're just engage in a row russell

767
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:29,589
you're not engaging in any kind of a
labrador rehearsal of at all

768
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:30,050
alm

769
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,009
so that

770
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:35,119
what eddie house was but what was once
thought or the discovering was something

771
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,770
that was not really about rehearsal at
all

772
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,920
it turns out we don't know

773
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,710
that painting houses subjects

774
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,200
when faced with meaningless

775
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,410
try grams like

776
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,249
anjaan do jabber whatever

777
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:52,510
tried to think of words that sounded
like tacit right

778
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:56,319
they conducted these nonsense syllables
to things that they already knew

779
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:57,870
when you actually have

780
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,689
engage in

781
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,370
part maintenance rehearsal

782
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,670
there is no relationship between the
amount of rehearsal

783
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,870
and all and long-term memory

784
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:10,189
but if you engage in although a bit of a
whole lot reversal

785
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:13,029
you can remember something for a long
time

786
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:16,359
are you still teach-in at the university
of wisconsin

787
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:20,189
when i would live in madison i had a
travel agent whose name i've actually

788
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:23,529
for gotten dogs something or somebody
but his

789
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:26,869
phone number was two five six four four
four four

790
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:31,299
five remember that i don't know if
wisconsin now for almost thirty years

791
00:36:31,299 --> 00:36:35,219
on all of the twenty years rather all
but i remember that because when dad

792
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:36,619
told me his number

793
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:37,459
he said

794
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:38,780
two fifty six

795
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:44,719
that's four raised to the fourth power

796
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,569
yeah kinda like the new information does
something you already know yet remember

797
00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:52,609
forever even if you'd really like to
forget it

798
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:56,449
on your just go is going to go to going
to remember that god that uh...

799
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:58,609
uh... in information

800
00:36:58,609 --> 00:37:02,559
so here in krakow walk-ins when they
grieve stricken their subjects to read

801
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,620
over her soul

802
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,600
there is no relationship between role
reversal of long-term memory but when

803
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,690
you when gays in the last word of a
reversal you'll find a very solid

804
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,049
relationship here's a demonstration of
that

805
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:15,099
from

806
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:19,559
dan all with gus creek and his colleague
and auto loving also

807
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,970
in which they presented subjects with

808
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,779
familiar words

809
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:26,079
the word trout

810
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,719
and ask the subjects to perform
particular kinds of tasks on each of

811
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:31,969
these words

812
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:33,450
for some words

813
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,109
subjects performed a structural

814
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:37,880
in which they were simply asked

815
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,760
to make a judgment about the physical
appearance of the word sometimes known

816
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,690
as a orthographic processing test

817
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:48,619
use the word printed in properties are
lower case

818
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:51,289
on does the word contain a particular
letter

819
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:54,049
or how many work aligns are there

820
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:55,130
didn't work

821
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,380
on nothing about the sound of the word
of the medium of the word or anything

822
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,160
like that just about the physical
appearance of the word

823
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,960
and all other conditions

824
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,410
the subjects were asked to take a phone
mitnick

825
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,959
or an acoustic judgment of the word

826
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:12,419
for example they were asked whether
would wine with some other word does

827
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:13,030
trout

828
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,609
rhyme with weight

829
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:16,970
well not really

830
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,740
order in some conditions their estimated
category judgment

831
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,049
is the word what type of fish

832
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:27,130
this case yes trumps or

833
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,289
all

834
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,979
org there might be a complex linguistic
judgment

835
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:33,799
like what the word fifth in the
following sends

836
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:35,410
he met a blank

837
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,929
in the street

838
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:40,469
he met a trail of the street

839
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:45,400
probably not two persons ok with
perfectly good english sadness but

840
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,349
not a very good

841
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:47,040
off it

842
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,329
for the senate

843
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:51,190
sold yen word after word after word

844
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,680
subjects were asked to make unorthodox
affect

845
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,760
on acoustic

846
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,140
a conceptual or a linguistic judgment
about the word

847
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,890
and then craig and holding surprise
subjects with

848
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:06,589
uh... memory test is that ok now that
we're going to do is surprise surprise

849
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:07,880
is a memory experiment

850
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,650
we want you remember all the words that
we presented

851
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:13,249
onto you

852
00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:16,070
words that were given a structural
encoding

853
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,579
where all the subjects did waters

854
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:21,390
make a judgment about the physical
appearance of the ordered

855
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:25,969
they were not remembered very well at
all about fifteen percent of the items

856
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:30,299
but if the subjects made an acoustic
judgment about the word

857
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:31,769
if they

858
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:35,749
volvo rested by the rhymed with some
other word

859
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,979
memory jumped about

860
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:42,779
almost four hundred percent to almost
sixty percent of the items

861
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:46,829
when they were asked to make a category
judgment it jumped up to about eighty

862
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:47,749
percent

863
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:51,350
and when they were asked if it would fit
into a particular sens frame

864
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:55,009
memory jumped again to about ninety
percent

865
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:56,559
in this experiment

866
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:01,599
the already emptied tasks structural
phonemic category and friends

867
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,689
are intended to control the young mailto

868
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:06,329
connection

869
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:10,619
that's made between the event that the
person is trying to remember the word

870
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,410
that the person's trying to remember

871
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,029
and something that he or she already
knows

872
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:16,849
in the structural case

873
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:19,039
there's not very much

874
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,419
called and not not very much linkage at
all

875
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:26,559
savor the word is printed in upper lower
case won't even reading the word

876
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:30,519
here at least you have to pronounce the
word yourself and link it to the other

877
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:31,459
word

878
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:33,289
dollar-billion in the rhyme

879
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:33,950
question

880
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:38,589
here you have to look at the category
knowledge once you say trying to get the

881
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:40,489
kind of fish

882
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:43,679
that were not the conflict everything
you know about fish

883
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:49,739
okay and then in the sense task gets
linked to even more alva even more

884
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:51,359
information

885
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,269
this is known as the depth of processing
affected memory

886
00:40:55,269 --> 00:41:00,039
the idea that structural processing is
very shallow processing

887
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:04,369
category and sends processing is very
deep processing and it illustrates what

888
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:08,130
we have come to call the elaboration
principal in memory

889
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:13,950
the first great principle of memory
which is that memory is a function

890
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,529
of the degree to which a new event

891
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:19,109
is related to pre-existing knowledge

892
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,819
the more you try to attend act-up

893
00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:24,119
some new saying that you've learned

894
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:26,310
with something that you already know

895
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,049
the better you're going to be able to
remember it

896
00:41:29,049 --> 00:41:30,269
all later on

897
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:35,269
which is one reason for example wayy and
study skills classes your it ought to

898
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:36,559
just

899
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:37,569
standby chapter

900
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:40,970
the scanned chapter headings first
before you actually go on and read the

901
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,569
chapter

902
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:43,759
because the chapter headings give you
all

903
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:47,419
framework for linking the stuff that you
already

904
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:50,510
it doesn't matter exactly how we

905
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,949
defined elaboration

906
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:55,619
you can think about elaboration terms of
the amount of attention that you pay to

907
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:56,809
the event

908
00:41:56,809 --> 00:42:01,040
you could think about collaboration in
terms of the number of features

909
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,619
that you extract from an event

910
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:05,230
visual features

911
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:08,439
acoustic features meaning features and
so on

912
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:10,589
or just the number of links

913
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:13,019
with your cree existing knowledge

914
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:15,380
however you define elaboration

915
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:20,169
the point of the elaboration principle
is bone marrow that that's better

916
00:42:20,169 --> 00:42:21,259
for memory

917
00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:24,510
the more you establish links between
something new

918
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,440
and something you already know about

919
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,410
the more likely you are to remember

920
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,919
that event

921
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:33,400
so now we have

922
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,730
true different modes of processing
occurring at the time of of all over her

923
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,630
soul

924
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,640
wrote reversal

925
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,790
in which you simply keep an item fresh
in your mind

926
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,829
two five six one flow pour four four
four two five six four four four four

927
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:48,430
whatever

928
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:53,469
and that maintains the item in inactive
state in what we call short term memory

929
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:55,160
but doesn't guarantee

930
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,059
that that item is going to be retained
in long-term memories

931
00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:01,150
and then the other motor processing

932
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:07,209
the elaborate iv homeowner processing in
which we try to link individual items

933
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:07,999
with things

934
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:10,259
we already know

935
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:12,760
elaboration is one of two

936
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,210
important process easy

937
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,180
governing

938
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,850
of the encoding phase

939
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,059
of memory

940
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:19,779
processing but it's not the only one

941
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:21,489
the second one

942
00:43:21,489 --> 00:43:23,269
is illustrated but this list

943
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,199
here's another study list

944
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:26,900
lion

945
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,249

946
00:43:29,249 --> 00:43:31,519

and purple

949
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:41,619
that when people remember these kind of
the list like this

950
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,859
what they usually do is i don't remember
the words in the order in which they

951
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:46,280
were presented

952
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,639
letter that you regroup the words so
that i removed from

953
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:55,229
that's the same conceptual category all
the number together

954
00:43:55,229 --> 00:43:56,989
body parts

955

tied

962
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:09,109
and the colors

963
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:09,850

and purple

966
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:15,420
here you're doing something or other
than

967
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,359
taking individual items and linking them
to something you already know

968
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,799
what you're doing is you're taking
individual items and linking them truly

969
00:44:23,799 --> 00:44:25,609
each other

970
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:28,989
who said what bill bunch of body parts
here

971
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:32,349
there are a whole bunch of colors there
are a whole bunch of all

972
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:33,499
lable

973
00:44:33,499 --> 00:44:38,940
alone four footed animals or whatever
through the extent

974
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,280
reorganize the material

975
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,740
solace to focus on and process the
relations among individual items you'll

976
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,849
remember individual items even

977
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:49,819
so

978
00:44:49,819 --> 00:44:53,619
on here is just an example of that

979
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:56,740
cluster carrot clustering of items by
categories

980
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,089
is a very prominent

981
00:44:59,089 --> 00:45:00,969
uh...

982
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:03,089
fighting in in this kind of literature

983
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:04,589
you can see here

984
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:07,459
that over trials

985
00:45:07,459 --> 00:45:08,520
recall

986
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,829
increases

987
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:14,789
but also people's tendency to cluster
items by category membership also

988
00:45:14,789 --> 00:45:15,460
increases

989
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,979
there's a correlation

990
00:45:16,979 --> 00:45:20,189
between clustering and recall

991
00:45:20,189 --> 00:45:21,989
and this correlation

992
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:23,099
illustrates

993
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,349
or second principle

994
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:26,959
uh... memory encoding

995
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:30,009
which is known as the organization
principle

996
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:35,439
in the organization principal memory is
a function of the extent to which

997
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:38,799
individual items are related to each
other

998
00:45:38,799 --> 00:45:39,840
memories of function

999
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,329
of the extent to which individual items
or related to each other

1000
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:46,489
so now we have two principles

1001
00:45:46,489 --> 00:45:48,509
elaboration an organization

1002
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:52,279
and just in summary let's compare the
two

1003
00:45:52,279 --> 00:45:57,130
yeah operation principle is a principle
that is idm specific

1004
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:04,130
it's concerned up only with the relating
of individual list items to pre existing

1005
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:06,420
knowledge

1006
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,059
organization

1007
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:12,919
more relational processing what you're
trying to do is to process the relations

1008
00:46:12,919 --> 00:46:14,890
among items

1009
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:16,450
and mouth and finger

1010
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,409
the role body parts

1011
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:21,560
having discovered that i got three body
parts on the list

1012
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,759
it makes it easier for me to remember

1013
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:26,609
one of those

1014
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:28,830
both the elaboration principle

1015
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,549
by which we link newell information

1016
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:33,160
to information

1017
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,940
previously stored

1018
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:39,250
and of the organization principal by
which we link

1019
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,349
individual items it wouldn't for mation
to each other

1020
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:42,839
reflect

1021
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:46,719
what the british psychologist frederick
bartlett

1022
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:50,339
effort after meaning

1023
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:51,349
after meeting

1024
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:52,940
the idea here is

1025
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:59,940
that we remember things better through
the extent that we try to make sense of

1026
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:02,239
either by elaborating

1027
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,340
them against preexisting knowledge

1028
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:09,420
or organizing a bunch of them together
inter of their relations

1029
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,189
ambient house is a mistake

1030
00:47:11,189 --> 00:47:15,029
a mistake that a lot of people were
making or under the influence of those

1031
00:47:15,029 --> 00:47:15,689
so

1032
00:47:15,689 --> 00:47:20,670
old stimulus response there is a warning
is that he was studying

1033
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,399
bomb

1034
00:47:22,399 --> 00:47:25,239
memory for items that are devoid of
meaning

1035
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:26,429
and still

1036
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:29,089
his subjects tried to make

1037
00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:33,349
meaningless material meaningful by
saying all that syllable resembles this

1038
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:34,619
word that i know or

1039
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,770
those are my best friends and nishal
czarist anything like that their book

1040
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,859
that that will create meaning in the
items

1041
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,699
why don't we try to make sense what's
happening

1042
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:47,739
when we tried to relate

1043
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,409
new things to what we already know

1044
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,629
when we tried to relate new things to
each other

1045
00:47:53,629 --> 00:47:55,600
when we engage in a labrador

1046
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,880
and organizational activity

1047
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,219
that's when we remember

1048
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:01,670
collaboration

1049
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:06,850
an organization two principles that
govern yun coding stage of memory

1050
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,069
processing

1051
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:11,809
next time we'll take up the storage
space

1052
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:13,619
thank you very much we'll see you on
wednesday
