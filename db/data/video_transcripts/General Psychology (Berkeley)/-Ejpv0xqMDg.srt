1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,280
okay let's continue our discussion of
learning

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,819
before i do that though one
clarification

3
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:17,009
arms apologize for any confusion that
was caused by the aren't by the mail and

4
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:20,999
i sent out over the weekend about the
review slides

5
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:22,939
though a little caption

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,800
indicated that the uh... exam was
scheduled for sometime in september

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,630
that was last year

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,289
on

9
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:31,770
i've corrected at the story for the
confusion

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,430
just like to make it clear that the
examines going to be held as scheduled

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,170
on wednesday october third

12
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,770
with the review session as scheduled on
monday or cover first

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,350
what's up on the course website now is a
new set of slides all that you can use

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,810
for review and what's coming in about a
day or so

15
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,920
is a narrative that accompanies those
flights that'll give you some more

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,980
information

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,670
about what to focus on

18
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,400
and what you can't ignore

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,739
especially you know

20
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:02,140
img whiteman

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,430
so there's an exam scheduled for
wednesday october third review session

22
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,250
monday

23
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,490
october first

24
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,670
next week will be arm

25
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,130
talking about uh...

26
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,470
sensation perception

27
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,120
okay last time i talk to you about a
major forum of learning

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,850
i discovered more than a hundred years
ago by russian all of the physiologist

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,540
even pablo

30
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,610
all

31
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,260
and the significance of this flood
warning notice classical conditioning

32
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,090
is that

33
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,020
classical conditioning

34
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,609
extends

35
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:45,220
the range of stimuli deccan evoke
involuntary reflex of responses

36
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,229
what classical conditioning does is
attached to these reflexive behaviors

37
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,649
to stimuli

38
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:54,180
that ordinarily wouldn't be able to them

39
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,930
usually dog celebrate when there's food
put in their miles mel pavlov's dogs

40
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,399
elevated

41
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,270
when a battle all rangel

42
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,169
all right as i point out last time

43
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:09,299
the phenomenon of classical conditioning
are basically ubiquitous lien

44
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:10,130
nature

45
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,850
every organism virtually every organism
with a nervous system in fact every

46
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,500
organism with a nervous system

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,170
our shows that we thought were the
phenomenal of classical conditioning

48
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,679
pablo believed

49
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:24,079
along that all learning

50
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,379
was

51
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,079
classical

52
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,010
on your nature of that is that

53
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,619
classical conditioning on drill a hole

54
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:32,109
alba warning that

55
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,390
organisms can do

56
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,319
but we now know that is very

57
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,530
too strong a position to take but it
does seem to be the case

58
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,310
that are by virtue of something very
much like classical conditioning

59
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,120
we acquire a lot of our a motion all
responses to events

60
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,209
some of our emotional responses to
events art

61
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:53,290
reflex

62
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,650
but others are acquired through
something like classical conditioning

63
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,819
so the become too like something was

64
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,330
fears some things

65
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,959
avoid all or be averse to some things
and so on

66
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,899
all by virtue of the attachment

67
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:14,220
an association between a previously
neutral object and psalm

68
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,169
home formal motion will stimulus

69
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:24,079
at the same time as pavlov was studying
classical conditioning in his laboratory

70
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,719
in saint petersburg russia

71
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,409
another a psychologist an american
psychologist are ever tell thorndike was

72
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:33,529
studying in another form of learning

73
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:38,609
in his laboratory at columbia university
in art in new york

74
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:42,549
and this is our diagram of thorndike's
are apparatus

75
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:47,339
known as a puzzle box and what ford bike
was doing have not worked with barbs

76
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:49,249
thorndike work with cats

77
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:51,819
are in for dikes method it was too

78
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:53,530
on dalton uh...

79
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,750
put cuts in this puzzle box

80
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,989
and let them

81
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:58,819
learn how to out to get out

82
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:03,010
and the way the puzzle boxes of his own
constructed

83
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,479
here's the cage

84
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,720
here's a door with the latch on it

85
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,930
that's connected by a string to a paddle
that's inside all of the cage

86
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,139
and when thorndike first put the cat
include the uh... puzzle box

87
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,510
cat did what cats ordinarily do but have
you ever have cats you take a minute

88
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,989
reluctance to prevent or whatever

89
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:23,709
they want to get out

90
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:28,999
so thorndike's cats would meow where
made scrabble around the cajun they

91
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:31,939
engage in all sorts of sort of random
behavior

92
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,100
in the course of which

93
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,270
they would just accidentally press on
this panel

94
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,150
which would pull on the string which
would open the latch which will allow

95
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,959
the door to open in the cat would

96
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,099
with expecting about there was

97
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:50,219
thorndike pick up the cat bump it back
in a cage close the door

98
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:52,390
capitol around inside the box

99
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,659
accidentally trip on the paddle

100
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:58,490
polled accord open the latch open the
door the cat would come out there before

101
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,689
and i can

102
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:02,630
i kept on the cat back in a box

103
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,279
orlando and so on

104
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,510
although what thorndike noticed

105
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,420
was that on repeated trials

106
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,960
the cats

107
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,060
pressed the

108
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,820
vault lover more quickly here is foreign
dikes actual

109
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,949
data data from his experiment

110
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,240
or if you're a number of trials up to
sixty here's the latency

111
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,080
all up to three minutes

112
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,210
author action after six minutes three
hundred sixty seconds

113
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,669
all of that it took though i'll be at
the cat to too

114
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:32,780
or open the door

115
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,790
and you can see that there is a clearer
downward trend so that on the first

116
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,490
trial it took the cat

117
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,189
for five minutes on average to open the
door

118
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:45,050
on successive trials

119
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,280
tube progressively last time

120
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,169
so that on the sixteen th trial

121
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:51,509
the cat was opd was

122
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:54,310
got would go in the cage press the lever

123
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,990
and all of the media lee

124
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,110
come out a cage and of course there
before and i could to killed the cat

125
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,159
back in a cage while for another trial

126
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,490
but the point here is

127
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,050
that over successive trial's

128
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,669
well wait and see all of the escape
responds

129
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,199
are diminished soul apparently

130
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,980
the other mls the cats were learning how
to open the door

131
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,560
and thorndike concluded

132
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,130
that this learning was although it was
produced

133
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,210
by the fact that

134
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,399
the behavior

135
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,300
had some consequence for the animal

136
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,770
he was able to escape from the puzzle
box

137
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,529
at least on at least momentarily

138
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:32,910
also of load for indict argued

139
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,520
that this was a form of learning

140
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,249
that was motivated by reward

141
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:43,430
on the basis all of his studies are
katzen puzzle boxes

142
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,359
thorndike formulated a set of laws of
learning there were about eight of these

143
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:52,499
but three of them are primary though the
most important ones for our purposes and

144
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:55,030
they're the ones i'm going to focus on
here

145
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:00,099
the first of these with what or and i
called on welcome reading this

146
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:05,729
and what the wall of reading this
state's is that lure name is motivated

147
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,689
alright the organisms internal state

148
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,030
so that

149
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,059
motivational states whether the cat is
hungry

150
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,669
or thirsty

151
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,260
or wants to flee or wants to get out or
whatever

152
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,860
those motivational states

153
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,620
activate whole sequence of behaviors

154
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,750
the cats confined in a puzzle box

155
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,330
it doesn't want to begin their and so
would engage isn't all sorts of well all

156
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,639
sorts of behaviors

157
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,110
the second of these all laws

158
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,470
is all they have a fact which basically
says

159
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:43,770
that responses that lead to reward up
are strengthened

160
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,769
responses to lead to reward are
strengthened

161
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,740
and by the same token

162
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,110
responses that do not lead to reward

163
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,739
weakened

164
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,869
so what happens is it may take

165
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:55,889
for five minutes

166
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,870
for the animal to press the paddle the
first on the first trial

167
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,020
that pat oppressing response that title
pressing behavior leads to the

168
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,299
possibility of a skate so pressing the
paddle is gradually

169
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:11,840
strengthened over time

170
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,210
whereas the other things the cat's doing

171
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,410
this scene

172
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,229
scratching at though that the other side
of the cage

173
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:19,849
or whatever else it's going

174
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,150
that's both behaviors are not rewarded

175
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,629
and they gradually dropout all of the
animals response behavior

176
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:30,019
so responses that are rewarded or
strengthen

177
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:34,459
responses that are not rewarded to or
weakened and then finally

178
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:37,289
alm for our purposes the law of exercise

179
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,799
which basically says

180
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,460
that connections between stimuli and
responses

181
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,340
are strengthened by practice

182
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,150
okay strengthened by repetition

183
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,370
and weakened

184
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,730
disuse

185
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,500
connections between stimuli and
responses or strengthened by practice

186
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,670
and weakened by distance as i say there
were five other subsidiary was

187
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,570
but we don't have to worry about the use
of a little

188
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,420
what's going on here

189
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,569
part of basic are the basic because
illustration

190
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:12,680
of what we now have come to call
instrumental conditioning

191
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,680
or what some psychologist notably b_f_
skinner calls operant conditioning

192
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,880
there's a technical difference between
instrumental in operant conditioning but

193
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,410
it

194
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,199
doesn't matter for us at this level of
the chorus

195
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:26,250
we're going to use these terms

196
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,380
interchangeably

197
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,380
and the idea behind although at the
general principle of instrumental

198
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:31,989
conditioning

199
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,610
is that animals

200
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,980
law-abiding acquire

201
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,230
all adaptive behaviors

202
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,630
through the experience of success or a
failure

203
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,719
sometimes called operant conditioning

204
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,730
because in the form of conditioning

205
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,960
the organism operates on the environment
in some way

206
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,329
the cat presses a paddle okay that's a
operant

207
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:55,990
like a kind of response

208
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,699
whereas in classical conditioning

209
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:01,720
the edible doesn't operate on the
response in any way that you must

210
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,910
celebrates or whatever it's going to do

211
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,470
it's also called instrumental
conditioning

212
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,510
because this conditioned response is
instrumental

213
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,810
in getting for the organism something
that once okay

214
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,340
are so that's the general idea here the
organism is operating on the environment

215
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,910
changing it in some way

216
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,600
and the behavior is instrumental the end
of

217
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,829
i

218
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:27,390
getting for the or organism

219
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,059
some desired all

220
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:30,690
the state of affairs

221
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,889
whereas in classical conditioning

222
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:37,219
we see organisms forming associations
among stimuli

223
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,660
between battles

224
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,330
and food between conditioned stimuli and
unconditional stimulus

225
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,160
in instrumental conditioning

226
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,620
we see on the walls forming responses

227
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,740
between their behaviors

228
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,020
and the i'll calms

229
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,590
of those behaviors between patil
pressing and getting old of the auto

230
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,250
oh out of the yarn oppose a box

231
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,320
so again

232
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,620
by virtue although instrumental
conditioning

233
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,700
what happens is that

234
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,129
all voluntary behaviors

235
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:11,740
not involuntary reflex of behaviors

236
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,030
but so-called voluntary behaviors like
paddle pressing that's not all

237
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,880
nodded innate reflex

238
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,430
these kinds of behaviors

239
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,200
come under the control ald environmental
events

240
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,770
and again the phenomenal all

241
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,680
instrumental conditioning or nearly
ubiquitous in nature

242
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,750
all vertebrate organisms at any rate all
birder bird organisms and many

243
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,360
invertebrate organisms

244
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,760
control

245
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,550
saw the phenomenal of instrumental
condition so that's a lot of organisms

246
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,019
are a lot of species

247
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:46,390
that could spill or instrumental
conditioning

248
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,519
just as parable off the lot

249
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,930
that older teen was a kind of variant on
classical conditioning

250
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,599
so thorndike and scatter

251
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:58,610
thought that all learning was org

252
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,200
was a very into bondage mental
conditioning

253
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,749
we now know that

254
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:05,630
that viewpoint is also too extreme

255
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,420
however

256
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,259
it's very clear now

257
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:09,470
that home

258
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,019
the laws of instrumental conditioning

259
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:13,019
appeared with carol

260
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:17,920
for much of the uh... acquisition
maintenance and display

261
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,300
of lots of adaptive behavior for what
ever happened

262
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,670
of it or behaviors

263
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,970
or acquired through hardness terminal
condition basically

264
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,130
anything that organisms learn to do
under conditions of incentive

265
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,090
the are week at once to get out

266
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,660
followed the animal wants to get federal
once globe water or whatever

267
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,640
instrumental conditioning

268
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,420
is what seems to be uh... seems to be
going on there

269
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,950
let us know

270
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,330
terror

271
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,579
classical and instrumental conditioning

272
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,100
on a number of salient dimensions there
are a least four differences between

273
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,790
these two forms of learning

274
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,730
and i think going over them will help
you to understand what's going on here

275
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,290
are all the love that better

276
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,870
in the first place

277
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,669
in classical conditioning

278
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:08,200
reinforcement

279
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,440
is not does not depend on the animal's
behavior

280
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,210
think about pavlov's dog for a second

281
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,699
dole installed by food

282
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:17,949
bell food

283
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:18,860
dole food

284
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,050
and it doesn't matter what the adult
dogs

285
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,709
okay

286
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:26,699
the adults just sitting there section
not doing anything it's in this harness

287
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:30,370
it can move around it's not parking
that's not doing anything

288
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,990
health food bell food dole food

289
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,930
the reinforcement

290
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,230
all of the presentation of the food
following that the bell

291
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,460
doesn't depend on anything that the
animal does

292
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,149
all by comparison

293
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:46,600
in instrumental conditioning

294
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,630
reinforcement is precisely dependent

295
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,839
army or army cats behavior

296
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,520
if it acted and press the paddle in the
puzzle box and never get out

297
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,110
and gave out as the reinforcement for
the paddle pressing behavior

298
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,160
so the animals got to engage in some
kind of behavior for reinforcement ought

299
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,550
to be presented

300
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,130
alm another difference between classical
and instrumental conditioning is that in

301
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,249
classical conditioning

302
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:16,629
the behavior that you're interested in

303
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:19,399
is if you listed as a reflex

304
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,720
by the on condition stimulus

305
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,420
what problem wants to do

306
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,299
is to condition the dog so that it's
elevates in response to the barrel

307
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:34,500
okay but the celebration izzy elicited
as a reflex by the meat power

308
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,580
by contrast

309
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,879
in the instrumental conditioning

310
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,959
behavior is even edited

311
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,459
freely

312
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,350
by the organism

313
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,290
all there's nothing that you can do to
make the cat

314
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,930
press the pedal okay

315
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,500
is just got to do it

316
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,170
and its own on its own sweet time

317
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,120
so there's nothing you can do to elicit
this people's patil pressing behavior

318
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,740
it's not any kind

319
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,180
org new york it's not any kind of a
reflex

320
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,000
okay so here's a third with the podium
pretty much the same point

321
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,649
in classical conditioning

322
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:09,950
what's been conditioned as an
involuntary response

323
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,010
while reflexive response

324
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,970
that is an involuntary response

325
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,780
to some stimulus

326
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,790
what has been conditioned instrumental
conditioning

327
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:24,079
is our voluntary response of behavior at
the animal engages in

328
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,790
more or less spontaneously

329
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,810
because classical conditioning

330
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,110
brings involuntary reflex of behaviors
under environmental control

331
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:40,470
there are relatively few behaviors that
are subject to classical conditioning

332
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,379
why

333
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,740
costar relatively few reflexes

334
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,190
we compare dot all the things that
animals kundu reflexes constitute a

335
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,620
relatively small part

336
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,650
of their behavioral or repertoire

337
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,870
also you can

338
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,540
condition dogs to celebrate you can
condition the eye blink reflex you can

339
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,189
condition the patellar reflex

340
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,870
in condition all sorts of reflexes

341
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,809
on through classical conditioning are
but there's lots more that you can do

342
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:09,150
with the instrumental case

343
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,639
condition alleles to engage in on not
only all sorts of bought

344
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,400
voluntary behaviors but all sorts of

345
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,000
combinations or voluntary behaviors

346
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,590
before and i take it had the patience to
do so in this experiment

347
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,600
he could have trained his cats

348
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,110
sit-down scratch their right here's
scratch their left ear wag their tails

349
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,180
and then press

350
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,020
the paddle

351
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,279
in order to go out

352
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,400
that whole pattern of behavior

353
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,109
could have been shaped up

354
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:41,890
or by be compelled by of instrumental of
the conditioning

355
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,319
so again

356
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:45,339
classical an instrumental conditioning

357
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,700
reef of represent

358
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:53,359
somewhat different forms of learning and
a volvo babel animals to learn

359
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,250
somewhat different kinds of things

360
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,740
quick questions on instrumental
conditioning or the comparison with

361
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:05,740
classical conditioning

362
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,680
classical conditioning and instrumental
conditioning are different

363
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,490
but if you think about it for a second
most examples of adaptive behavior alm

364
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,449
reflects some kind of combination

365
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:20,559
of classical

366
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,159
and instrumental conditioning this has
made clear i think

367
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:29,599
by a form of fall of the learning that
is often studied in the psychological

368
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,340
laboratory

369
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,230
known as a boy who's learning

370
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,269
this is the apparatus weren't used in
some classic studies by of avoidance

371
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:36,980
learning

372
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,940
by richard solomon and all and london
win

373
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,659
all solomon and win lots of other of

374
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:46,950
uh... psychologist as well

375
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,360
use dogs in these studies

376
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,230
all of this is known as a uh...
avoidance apparatus it's a shuttle box

377
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,870
it's pretty

378
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,140
that's all about eight feet long

379
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,340
four-feet about forty five oh three feet
more things

380
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,469
pretty good container

381
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:04,040
on for a dog

382
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,809
and what are they did in this and then
these experiments

383
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:11,460
if you do you place the dorgan one-sided
all of the apparatus

384
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,120
and there are some whites in the side of
that can deliver conditioned on stimulus

385
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,070
and down here on the floor

386
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:24,840
is a warrior grated that can deliver
eight all my old not universe of

387
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,590
electrical shock but not only for
michael shots or anything like that

388
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,970
all mildly painful electrical shock two
hour to the feet of global of the dog

389
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,480
all and what happens in this experiment
is the body of one side of the shuttle

390
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
box

391
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,050
the lights will come on

392
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,369
or the and then a couple seconds after
the lights go on

393
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:46,730
than the shock is delivered to defeat

394
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,750
and what will happen is that the animal
would just kind of

395
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,660
naturally start moving around

396
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,270
and will eventually

397
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,320
job over

398
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,830
this barrier into the other side of the
shuttle box

399
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,120
when the animal johnson to the other
side of the shuttle box the shock goes

400
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,470
off the tone and and the lights go off

401
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,780
odd then what happens is

402
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,630
the lights come on in this site of the
shuttle box

403
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,389
secretary later

404
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:16,049
the shock comes on yahool feels the
shock of course eventually moves over to

405
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:19,020
the other side of the shuttle box

406
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,270
shock goes off let's go off

407
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,470
after a little bit of rest

408
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,260
lights come on shock comes on a couple
seconds later and the animals over

409
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,370
it's a shadow box experiment

410
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,190
because what the animal learns to do

411
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,649
is to shuttle

412
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,000
back in four th

413
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,140
the initial art of the responses on
initial on the early trials in the

414
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,789
experiment

415
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:41,399
art escaped royals

416
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:42,769
because they occur

417
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:44,930
after the shock has come on

418
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,139
white is the condition stimulus

419
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:49,300
shock is the on condition stimulus

420
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,590
when you make the of the response

421
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,450
after the onset of the shock

422
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,660
that's known as an escape response

423
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,580
but eventually what happens is

424
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,140
the abalone policy of the escape
response begins to decrease joint strike

425
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,030
with

426
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,080
thorndike's volvo tax in the puzzle box

427
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,580
so that at some point

428
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,370
yeah double will

429
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,770
vault over the barrier

430
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,299
and make the response before the shock
even comes on

431
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,530
that's the animals

432
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,400
avoidance response doesn't escape
shocking avoids shock altogether

433
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,540
and a very quickly

434
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,680
the animals learn

435
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,470
to make this avoids response just as
soon as the condition stimulus comes on

436
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,770
so what's going on in this kind of
experiment now

437
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,600
that the aval it's acquiring through
different kinds of associates

438
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,830
it's learning in the first place that
there's a so there's an association

439
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,970
between the lights and the shock

440
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,850
that's classical conditioning

441
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,200
where the alamos learning about the
association between the lights in the

442
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,090
shock

443
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,669
and then we have all learned

444
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,860
but there's an association between

445
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,410
retin a barrier

446
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,670
and termination

447
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,040
all of the shock

448
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,700
that's instrumental conditioning

449
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,059
where the animal is florian association

450
00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:07,130
between some behavior

451
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,599
vaulting over the barrier

452
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,309
and the consequences of that

453
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:11,950
barrier

454
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,680
so all again the animals warning two
things

455
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,740
accommodation of classical and
instrumental conditioning

456
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,770
by virtue of classical conditioning the
animal comes to associate

457
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,110
the shock

458
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,620
the light

459
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,960
by virtue of instrumental conditioning

460
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,720
the animal comes to associate walking
the barrier

461
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,290
removal

462
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,919
or the termination

463
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,870
of the shock when you get up in the
morning

464
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,370
you couldn't have a somewhat similar
experience

465
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,620
onto these dogs in the short of ox

466
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,510
when you are all clock radio goes off at
your clock radio is anything like mine

467
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,950
when you set it to go off the first
thing that happens is that

468
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,799
the radio comes on

469
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,919
public radio or kuwait or whatever it is
that you listen to tape fog

470
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,330
and then maybe five ten minutes later
what happens

471
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,460
doesn't goes off right very diverse a
buzzer

472
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,270
all and then you've got to

473
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,620
reach over to your clock radio and turn
the bauza ralph

474
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,000
future earn

475
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,460
if your press that button

476
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,509
in the interval between the time the
radio comes on the time the buzzer comes

477
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:18,989
on

478
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:21,810
you can prevent buzzer from coming on
entirely

479
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:25,240
that's exactly the situation that these
towards the rent

480
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,130
and that you've learned the association
between the radio coming on and the

481
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,560
alarm coming on and you've learned that
there's something you can do either to

482
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,240
turn the alarm off

483
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,590
order preventing alarm

484
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,930
from coming on on entirely

485
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,220
on its own it's very much hard it's very
much the same kind of thing

486
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,950
anderson ulcers

487
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,880
of of avoidance learning

488
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,110
is what is all going on

489
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:53,509
in the hall home radio theory call the
tune factor theory will boren's learning

490
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:56,029
proposed by a psychologist name our work

491
00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:00,380
in new york pardon the late nineteen
forties ok remember what happens

492
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,820
is that there is light

493
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,260
followed by shock

494
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,110
if the adl response during a shock

495
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,670
it's rewarded by escaping from the shock

496
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,669
if the adl responds after the light but
prior to the shock

497
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:16,149
it's rewarded by avoiding the shock
entirely

498
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:19,840
anmol recently said look the first thing
that happens here

499
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,600
is that you condition theater

500
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,730
to the white

501
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,480
you know the uh... the shock as painful
the animals of dixie animal afraid

502
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,110
and new condition anticipatory fear far
to the light

503
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,570
and then what you do

504
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,740
is you reinforce escape avoidance all by
uh... alone

505
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,440
by these cessation

506
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,210
of the shark andy associated like

507
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,110
so again

508
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,830
this simply illustrates

509
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,649
major form of learning combines both

510
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:54,549
all aspects of classical conditioning

511
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:56,880
and instrumental conditioning

512
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,670
by virtue of classical conditioning

513
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:03,350
associate

514
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,270
the shock

515
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,970
by virtue called

516
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,310
it's mental conditioning

517
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,230
all associate avoidance risque response

518
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,180
with or with the termination of the
shock

519
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,270
two factors

520
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,049
one factor having to do with classical
conditioning and one factor having to

521
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:18,780
learn

522
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,470
font having to do

523
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,540
instrumental condition

524
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,980
classical conditioning

525
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,200
instrumental conditioning two major
forms of learning

526
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,960
what is that exactly that subjects that
that these animals or learning

527
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,290
well for a long time in psychology

528
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:42,490
alm the alcohol learning was fought to
be as automatic as on today's reflexes

529
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:46,540
all and what happened is that by virtue
of classical an instrumental

530
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,179
conditioning

531
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:49,690
saw little

532
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,770
dogs cats rats pigeons humans

533
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,410
all acquired connections between stimuli

534
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,840
and responses to them

535
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,770
and this is what's known as the stimulus
response or s are learning theory which

536
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:04,650
entailed

537
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,510
four

538
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,360
different

539
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,079
assumptions each of which

540
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,050
or critical for understanding the theory

541
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,950
the first of these assumptions

542
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:18,040
is the assumption of association by kon
tiki woody

543
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,470
the f_ aren't learning theorists

544
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,120
argued

545
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,740
that associations

546
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,899
are formed

547
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:26,890
when there is the repeated

548
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,810
occurrence of two of ends

549
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,440
the condition stimulus

550
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,060
andy on condition stimulus the response
and the reinforcement

551
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,280
the idea here is

552
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,340
association performed

553
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,750
between stimuli and responses

554
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,830
that occur close together in space and
time

555
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,979
for pablo

556
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:50,900
the bells followed very quickly by food
within a second or two

557
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,330
for thorndike

558
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,710
patil pressing the patil

559
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,209
is followed very quickly

560
00:25:55,209 --> 00:25:56,460
by escape

561
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,300
within a second or two

562
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,270
the general idea here is that the
repeated

563
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,149
joint

564
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:07,350
occurrence the repeated co occurrence of
two events

565
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,770
closely related in space and time close
together in space

566
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,460
close together in time

567
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,309
creates an association

568
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:15,140
between them

569
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,379
and that that association

570
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:18,529
that the on wall

571
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:20,020
is uh... is learning

572
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,619
in classical conditioning

573
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:24,690
the associations between two events in
the environment

574
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,450
the bell and the food

575
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,999
in instrumental conditioning

576
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:31,909
the associations between some behavior

577
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:33,640
and its consequences

578
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,570
patil pressing

579
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,900
an escape

580
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,409
bolting

581
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:37,649
the barrier

582
00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:40,680
and escape

583
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,300
that's the first assumption

584
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,890
the second assumption

585
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:47,309
is what's known as the arbitrariness
assumption

586
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:52,240
and the arbitrariness assumption
basically says that by virtue all of us

587
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,280
those haitian by kon tiki woody

588
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,110
any stimulus

589
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,359
can be attached

590
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,700
to any response

591
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,720
you could arbitrarily select

592
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,010
anne stimulus in the world so long as
the organism consensus

593
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,730
and any response

594
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,620
that the organism can make

595
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,430
and foreman association

596
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,130
between them

597
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,050
you can select stimuli

598
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,290
and responses arbitrarily

599
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,520
and form an association between them

600
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,660
by virtue

601
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,409
poem allowed by virtue of continuity

602
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,150
so future but want to do it in

603
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:30,090
and arbitrariness then there are two
kind of

604
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,520
hidden assumptions

605
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,300
on in s are learning theory

606
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,680
which also turned out to be important

607
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,659
one of these is known as

608
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:41,690
the assumption of the empty organism

609
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:46,700
and wealthiest the that what mt organism
means is that you can all understand

610
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,040
that handles behavior

611
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,940
slowly in terms of all of

612
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,610
stimulus inputs

613
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:59,250
and response outputs

614
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,910
thus elevation

615
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,720
the light the shock

616
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,950
and the escape

617
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,310
all you have to do doll you have to know

618
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,629
if you want to understand what organ
donors as is a must learn

619
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:11,799
is what the stimuli are

620
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,700
and what the reinforcements or

621
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,780
that are being associate

622
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,560
put another way

623
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,230
these learning theorists

624
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,039
for all of the organism

625
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,870
as essentially a black box

626
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:29,510
that connects stimuli and responses are
those of you laws of familiar with

627
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,299
computers

628
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:33,019
order or other kinds of engineering
things no black box

629
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:35,159
is simply a device that connects two
things

630
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,610
and you don't know how it works

631
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,440
you don't know how it does these kinds
of connections

632
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,110
and he s are learning terrace

633
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:46,360
didn't know how these connections were
made and they didn't care

634
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,639
all they said was all they got to know

635
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:51,010
is that there are still alive and
responses

636
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,120
and the organism

637
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,730
although connects them up

638
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:59,960
we don't need to understand anything
about the organisms inter workings

639
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,580
in order to understand

640
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,810
what it's learning

641
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,050
all we have to do is understand

642
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,640
what stimuli ring pinging on the
organism

643
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,049
and what responses its making

644
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,250
and then finally

645
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,440
the final assumption barbie
traditionalists are theory of learning

646
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,540
if the assumption all of the passive
organism

647
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,200
the idea here is

648
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,690
that the organism

649
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,770
isn't it active during a learning
process

650
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,410
pavlov's dog is in trying to figure out

651
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,580
what's going on in the experiment

652
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,679
thorndike's cats

653
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,270
or trying to

654
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:41,080
figure out how to get out all of the law
out of the art of the puzzle box it just

655
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,770
happens

656
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,570
okay

657
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,760
by virtue of

658
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,940
the parent of the bell in the food

659
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,090
the animal

660
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,590
comes too

661
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,070
salivate

662
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,990
by virtue of the pairing of the paddle
pressing and escape the animal columns

663
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,780
to press

664
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,799
the panel

665
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:58,779
it's this assumption of the passive
organism

666
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:00,379
that actually give those

667
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:03,450
the metaphor conditioning

668
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,590
the idea here is that were nina
something that

669
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,370
happens to an organism

670
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,550
when you condition your hair

671
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,610
there put stuff on your heritage either
it gets less trivia ricketts more fruity

672
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,510
depending on what kind of condition your
youth

673
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,299
your hair isn't in or please let me
softer please please choose this one

674
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:22,200
don't use that one

675
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,280
in boulder the process

676
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,860
something is being done

677
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,590
similarly

678
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:32,200
and classical an instrumental
conditioning the prevailing view

679
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,900
is that things are happening

680
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,540
true

681
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,750
the organism

682
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:41,210
but the organism really is and actively
involved in the process

683
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,410
alm

684
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,710
or what's happening here

685
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,710
is that the havier is coming under the
control of the barn mental events

686
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,149
there's no sense he wrote

687
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:51,290
expectations were

688
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,669
free will or anything like that

689
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:54,889
on the park

690
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:57,790
all of the organism

691
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:02,670
these four assumptions association by
conjugate woody

692
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,550
arbitrariness

693
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,730
the empty organism and the path of
organism

694
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,980
we now know are entirely well

695
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,670
i talk about them because these
assumptions dominated the psychology of

696
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,669
learning

697
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:19,710
for more than half a century

698
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:26,480
and you can still see their residues in
the some psychological theories today

699
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,380
more important

700
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,049
demonstrating

701
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:32,250
however these assumptions were wrong

702
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:37,980
left us a legacy of some of the most
interesting stories in the learning

703
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,860
literature

704
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,419
studies that we're going to talk about

705
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:42,559
in the remainder of this lecture

706
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,880
and aware of that and the next lecture

707
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,160
we know it all

708
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,830
all of those wide variety of
experimental results

709
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,360
that challenge

710
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,610
of these kind of common sense
assumptions

711
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,400
about

712
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,250
about the learning process

713
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,059
and reveal that learning is quite
different

714
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,580
from what these early theorists thought
carnivores

715
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:08,299
all of his these experiments comment
basically two forms studies of

716
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:10,230
what we think of as

717
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,220
biological constraints on learning

718
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,630
and then later

719
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,250
studies of what we think of has

720
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,290
cognitive

721
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:17,970
constraints

722
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,309
on all knwo are learning

723
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:22,270
let's look at that the

724
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,750
biological constraints on learning first

725
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,750
are because

726
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,510
what they do is challenge a specially

727
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,230
this assumption of arbitrariness

728
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:37,500
here's a classic experiment by john
garcia than at the university of utah

729
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,100
all and his associates on what's known
as taste aversion learning

730
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,580
all or all of the based on that what's
known as bait showing us

731
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,890
in the real world

732
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,030
when animals

733
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,250
encounter a new food

734
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:58,070
what they will do is they will sample
the food don't need a small amount of it

735
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,160
they'll go away

736
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,100
and wait

737
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,630
if they get sick

738
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,100
they'll never approach that food again

739
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,640
they might need somethin else but they
won't go up there but they won't or that

740
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,670
they won't eat that particular of food
again they'll avoid it

741
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,470
all this is all of the phenomena that's
well known to ranchers

742
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,530
or who have to do with carly ortiz

743
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:24,030
it's well-known on blood into farmers of
of all kinds

744
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,799
and what garcia and his colleagues dead

745
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,540
was to bring the this phenomenon bay
china's

746
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,159
into the laboratory

747
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,799
in a particularly interesting on
particularly

748
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:36,480
experiments

749
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,289
the experiment is really set up

750
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:42,340
all i thought as a kind of classical
conditioning or experiment the was

751
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,570
you'll see in a minute

752
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:48,200
it has a kind of instrumental
conditioning quality to it as well

753
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,870
what happened in this experiment

754
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,779
is at the sotheby's subjects

755
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,570
which were rats befor laboratory rats

756
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,540
were exposed to a compound conditioned
stimulus

757
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,750
while they drank water

758
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,290
animals just drink water in their cages
and while these animals

759
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,039
although what to would come out the
livery water

760
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,409
and while the animals

761
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:09,710
were allowed to drink

762
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:14,239
they were exposed to a compound stimulus
which is at their work

763
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,760
whites flashing

764
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,239
in their cage

765
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:20,509
there was a clicking noise presented

766
00:34:20,509 --> 00:34:23,529
indicate like a little ratchet that was
spinning around

767
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,020
and the water was flavored suite

768
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,739
with all the saccharine

769
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:31,649
so garcia call this compound conditioned
stimulus

770
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:34,889
noisy

771
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:39,109
the animals were allowed to drink
there's four on for a moment or two

772
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:40,970
and then they were exposed

773
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:45,869
to warn or to different kinds of one
condition stimulus

774
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:48,139
one group of rats

775
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,759
for chuck

776
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:53,399
after they started drinking which caused
them some

777
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,149
immediate

778
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:56,169
pain in the foot

779
00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:57,480
another group of rats

780
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,819
was exposed to wait mild does of x_-rays

781
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:05,389
which after some interval

782
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:06,450
made them sick

783
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,609
made them nauseated

784
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:10,169
after all

785
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:13,080
the aftershock group got immediate pain

786
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,899
in the presence of the bright noisy
sweetwater

787
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:19,789
ghar group in the the x_-ray group

788
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:26,759
delayed nausea nausea after some period
of time also in the presence

789
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:28,979
noisy sweetwater

790
00:35:28,979 --> 00:35:31,109
what garcia bended

791
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:33,400
was to put the animals in a situation

792
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,889
where they were allowed to select one
ought to sources of water

793
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:41,329
they were given a choice

794
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:44,890
between right noisy water on the one
hand

795
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,550
there was a water tap where the lights
were flashing and there was a little

796
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,089
ratchet noise

797
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:54,900
or there was a water source that
delivered sweetwater

798
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,429
flavored

799
00:35:56,429 --> 00:35:57,440
saccharine

800
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,479
and wat holmberg go what garcetti and
his colleagues discovered

801
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:02,789
was that

802
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:05,680
bottles one avoid the water

803
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,980
but the water source that they are
boarded

804
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,740
depended upon beyond conditioned
stimulus

805
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,920
to which they had been exposed

806
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,670
here it is a schematic diagram

807
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,610
of the

808
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,909
of the experiment

809
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:22,489
all subjects were exposed to

810
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:23,360
noisy

811
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,539
suite

812
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:26,889
some subjects

813
00:36:26,889 --> 00:36:28,789
word and exposed to

814
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:29,630
what shock

815
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,179
which deliver which were or produced
media pain

816
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:34,160
another group

817
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,719
was exposed to x_-rays which produced

818
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:40,889
delayed nausea take out the experiment

819
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:43,509
here's the compound condition stimulus

820
00:36:43,509 --> 00:36:46,039
here is the on condition stimulus

821
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,039
here's the unconditional response

822
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,639
and here's the unconditional response
for group too

823
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:53,919
now we give the animals have choice

824
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,539
they can either

825
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:57,040
from a bright

826
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,419
noisy

827
00:36:58,419 --> 00:36:59,450
source of water

828
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,619
or they can drink

829
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:01,749
from is sweet

830
00:37:01,749 --> 00:37:03,220
choice on source of water

831
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,069
and hear are the results of the
experiment

832
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:07,140
the alleles

833
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,660
that were shocked

834
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,750
preferred to drink

835
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,679
the sweetwater

836
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,519
avoided

837
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,219
the bright nor easy water

838
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:24,559
by the same token the animals that were
exposed to the x-ray

839
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,299
avoided

840
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:26,889
those sweetwater

841
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:28,730
and pretty strongly preferred

842
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,209
to drink

843
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:31,359
the bright

844
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,249
noisy water

845
00:37:33,249 --> 00:37:34,810
so what's going on here

846
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:37,470
is that the animals in the shock group

847
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,660
have learned an association

848
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,880
between pates other abs i'm sorry

849
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,910
we meet our boa brightness of the war

850
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,199
bright noisy water and shock

851
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:52,479
and the animals associated the x_-ray
have learned an association between the

852
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:55,679
taste of the water and at the uh... and
then the taste

853
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,199
here we have

854
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,199
the number of licks at their own that
they're getting

855
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:02,320
for now we have

856
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,989
to our animals exposed to

857
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:08,549
exactly the same conditions

858
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:11,249
saying compound stimulus

859
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:15,249
same on conditions of the two different
doggone conditions deployed delivered at

860
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:17,590
exactly the same time but they will
learn

861
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,999
two different things

862
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:20,719
the shark to rats

863
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,190
forum an association

864
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:27,219
between the site and sound of this the
condition stimulus

865
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:28,599
and at the shock

866
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,219
the portland rats

867
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:33,829
foreman association between the taste

868
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:35,210
of the stimulus

869
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:35,749
and

870
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:37,120
or and they're all

871
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,619
and their own version

872
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:40,680
what is being illustrated here

873
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,920
or is that

874
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,219
yeah walls

875
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:48,549
dot learn the same fein's okay

876
00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:50,239
through this again

877
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:54,989
all elements of the compound stimulus or
associated with a shock

878
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:59,679
but these are the walls only associate
the light and the noise with the shock

879
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:02,630
they don't associate the taste with a
shock

880
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,520
all the elements of the compound
condition stimulus

881
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,599
or equally contiguous

882
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,690
x_-ray but the animals formal
association

883
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:17,730
between the taste of the stimulus and
the x_-ray not the site or sound of the

884
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,240
stimulus in the x-ray

885
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,100
what this shows you is that

886
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,759
the associations of these animals are
forming are not arbitrary

887
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:30,629
these that rats can't learn the
association between taste in shock

888
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:32,749
they'd all learn it

889
00:39:32,749 --> 00:39:33,819
animals don't learn

890
00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:35,150
the association

891
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,089
between slight and so

892
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:38,100
and nausea

893
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,380
it's just not something that's possible
for them to learn

894
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,649
here it is they sell more kind of
finding in another domain

895
00:39:46,649 --> 00:39:49,970
all this is a scapegoat avoidance
learning in pigeons

896
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,839
this work by robert bowls at the
university of washington

897
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,840
and what polls discovered

898
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,309
was that it was the easy to teach a
pigeon

899
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:03,230
flap its wings or to stretch of snack

900
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,589
in order to avoid shock

901
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:07,320
very easy to teach a pigeon

902
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,289
thought that

903
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:11,670
but it is harder in fact it's impossible

904
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,900
the teacher pigeon

905
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,909
the pekka ke to avoid shock

906
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:16,570
even though

907
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,359
it's incredibly easy

908
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:19,509
to teach a pigeon

909
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:21,939
the pekka ke to get food

910
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:23,500
you can't teach a pigeon

911
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,610
to pack a key

912
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,859
to avoid shock

913
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:28,660
similarly if you look at rights

914
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,869
it's very easy

915
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:31,050
to teach rats

916
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,180
to jump up on a shelf

917
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,650
to avoid shock

918
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:39,859
it's very easy to teach rats to learn to
run in a shuttle box to avoid shock

919
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:42,660
but it's very difficult it's not
impossible

920
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,929
but it's very difficult

921
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:46,099
teacher al animals

922
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:47,370
to press the lever

923
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,039
to avoid shock

924
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:52,039
boulders inside

925
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:55,549
is that the of the escape an avoidance
responses

926
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:59,049
that animals find it easy to learn

927
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:04,289
are those that are part of their inmate
repertoire of escaping avoidance

928
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:05,059
responses

929
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:09,139
if you're in a park and there's a little
kid the park what a little kids do in

930
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:09,939
parks

931
00:41:09,939 --> 00:41:11,810
they chased pigeons

932
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:15,999
okay never was a little kid the world
the didn't chase pigeons in a park

933
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:17,720
and what are the pigeons don't

934
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,290
okay that's right

935
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,970
they flap their wings they fly away

936
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:22,390
and

937
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,109
in the process of beginning to flopping

938
00:41:25,109 --> 00:41:27,700
birds will stretched their necks as

939
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,499
preparation

940
00:41:29,499 --> 00:41:31,779
solitude to taking off

941
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:35,469
these are natural escape an avoidance
responses

942
00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:38,400
that pigeons have and it's easy for them

943
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,469
to lauren

944
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:41,419
to engage in those behaviors

945
00:41:41,419 --> 00:41:42,679
are to arm

946
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,329
and to avoid shock

947
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:45,260
similarly

948
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,759
all rats will run

949
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:51,390
only in natural environment roll into a
state prov predators

950
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,699
and they find

951
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:55,890
running and john jumping up on shelves

952
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,739
to be are very natural

953
00:41:57,739 --> 00:42:01,369
are very easy escape it avoids responses
to learn

954
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:03,240
bowles is in sight then

955
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,129
was there a boring us learning

956
00:42:05,129 --> 00:42:08,689
kepala capitalizes i'm each

957
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:14,810
species specific repertoire of innate
escape and response

958
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,759
form behaviors

959
00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:20,670
if the if the sub if they animals or
required to

960
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:24,690
learn to escape the response of those
gaping avoid they can do that much more

961
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,069
quickly if the escape it avoids response
that you're trying to learn

962
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:31,969
is one that is part of their

963
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:33,739
repertoire

964
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:36,160
so the general idea here

965
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,109
is that

966
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:41,759
be kinds of associations that are four
hundred classical and instrumental

967
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:42,410
conditioning

968
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,829
are not by any means arbitrary

969
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:48,049
instead

970
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:48,720
alton

971
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,140
baraka learning seems to be governed by
what's known only as the preparedness

972
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,679
principal in learning

973
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:59,420
the general idea behind preparedness the
preparedness principle

974
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,320
it is that

975
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,369
by bird true audits evolutionary history

976
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:06,739
every species

977
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:10,420
predisposed perform certain kinds of
associations

978
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,089
these associations that the species is
predisposed to acquire

979
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:16,519
are we call

980
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:17,880
prepared

981
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,139
associations

982
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:21,259
they are all other

983
00:43:21,259 --> 00:43:22,709
associations

984
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:25,190
the animals have not been

985
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,420
predisposed to acquire

986
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,190
we call those one prepared

987
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,869
associations

988
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:32,450
and there is still other

989
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,069
associations

990
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,190
that are

991
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:35,619
contra prepared

992
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:38,530
meaning that by virtue of the
revolutionary history

993
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:42,510
animals just certain animals certain
species simply can't make those

994
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:45,679
associations at all

995
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,459
associating sight and sound of shock

996
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,579
that's a pre pared association

997
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:52,509
for rats

998
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:53,269
associating

999
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:55,019
pays with north york

1000
00:43:55,019 --> 00:43:57,349
that's a prepared association

1001
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:58,989
for rats

1002
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:01,409
associating sight and sound with nausea

1003
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:02,849
that's controverted or

1004
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:03,799
they can't do it

1005
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:04,820
they're not built

1006
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,499
to do that

1007
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:07,200
associating

1008
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,630
on don't know

1009
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,929
taste with for choc

1010
00:44:09,929 --> 00:44:12,269
that's also contra prepared

1011
00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:15,319
rats simply aren't able to do that

1012
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,240
the implication of this

1013
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:24,069
is that you can't afterall treat the
organism as if it were empty

1014
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:26,409
you can simply

1015
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:28,759
arrange

1016
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:32,970
stimuli and responses so that they occur
close together in space and time

1017
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,339
and expect the animal to be good to be
able to pick up on that

1018
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:38,609
the first thing you have to do

1019
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:39,239
is that

1020
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:41,709
you have to understand

1021
00:44:41,709 --> 00:44:44,189
howdy organism is built

1022
00:44:44,189 --> 00:44:48,949
you have to understand something about
its internal biological structure

1023
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:50,679
in order to understand

1024
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:51,920
water can learn

1025
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,009
and what it can't work

1026
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:56,440
rats evolved in such a way

1027
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:02,239
that they associate sight and sound with
pain and taste with nausea

1028
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,369
words by the way evolved in exactly the
opposite way

1029
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:11,160
birds find it very easy to associate the
sight and sound that surrounds our food

1030
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,920
with its gastrointestinal consequences

1031
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,460
but they find it very very very
difficult to associate

1032
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,450
the case

1033
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,280
of food

1034
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,609
with its gastrointestinal consequences
if you think about it per second

1035
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:27,670
most birds or site feeders birds walk
around they steal

1036
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:31,309
piece of grain on that on the ground of
the c_a_c_ door

1037
00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:32,539
or an insect whatever

1038
00:45:32,539 --> 00:45:35,079
and they pack at they're built

1039
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:36,849
look at their food okay

1040
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:41,019
and pack at it they have taste buds they
can taste food but they're just not

1041
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:43,299
build to associate

1042
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:44,310
with all

1043
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,769
with nausea or anything like that

1044
00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:51,429
you have to understand the individuals
biological workings

1045
00:45:51,429 --> 00:45:53,689
how the organisms

1046
00:45:53,689 --> 00:45:54,609
rain

1047
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:55,479
nervous system

1048
00:45:55,479 --> 00:45:57,659
has been shaped by evolution

1049
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:01,430
in such a way as tall is to make it easy
for it to learn

1050
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,320
some kinds of associations

1051
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,280
and hard

1052
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,109
fruitful learn

1053
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:09,649
kinds of associations

1054
00:46:09,649 --> 00:46:11,490
first point here is that

1055
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:14,889
we've got these problems

1056
00:46:14,889 --> 00:46:17,360
alva learning that undermine

1057
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,140
certain

1058
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:22,279
all assumptions of the stimulus response
theory of learning

1059
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:27,019
undermining the assault the association
the assumption of a of all bitterness

1060
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:29,469
you can't joe's pic

1061
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:31,920
stimuli and responses arbitrarily

1062
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,479
and expect animals to learn

1063
00:46:34,479 --> 00:46:36,479
animals are prepared to learn

1064
00:46:36,479 --> 00:46:40,309
those stimulus response associations

1065
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:41,679
their predisposed to learn

1066
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:44,079
by virtue or evolution

1067
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,199
and you can't

1068
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:48,739
construe the organism as empty

1069
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,550
you have to understand

1070
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,340
that evolution has shaped

1071
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,670
it's nervous system

1072
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,599
so as to

1073
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:57,009
pre parent to learn some things

1074
00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:01,579
and to preventive from morning other
kinds of things

1075
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:02,419
finally

1076
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:06,989
it turns out that some of these
experiments also undermine the principal

1077
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:09,889
of association by continuity

1078
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:13,979
let's look at the garcia kaylene
experiment again

1079
00:47:13,979 --> 00:47:17,979
we have the bright noisy sweetwater
coming on

1080
00:47:17,979 --> 00:47:20,449
come it off

1081
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:22,269
is shock

1082
00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:26,289
coming on very quickly after the bright
noisy sweetwater

1083
00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:28,019
but look at the

1084
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:33,559
x_-rays you don't feel like x_-rays okay
there's no sensory aspect to being a

1085
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:38,899
radiated with x_-rays but the animal
does feel nauseated a long-time

1086
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:39,970
afterwards

1087
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:43,430
what's happening here is that in the ref
case

1088
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:47,670
rats are forming an association between
taste

1089
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:52,450
of food and its gastrointestinal const
taste of water and it's gastrointestinal

1090
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:56,239
consequences even though there is no
longer it of time

1091
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,630
separating the stimulus

1092
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:02,049
response

1093
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:07,329
garcia experiment is really kind of uk
triple whammy as far ends the

1094
00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:11,869
traditional as far as there is a warning
is concerned it undermines the

1095
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:13,729
assumption of arbitrariness

1096
00:48:13,729 --> 00:48:19,049
it undermines the assumption on vehicle
of the empty organism and it undermines

1097
00:48:19,049 --> 00:48:22,650
the assumption of association by trying
to do it

1098
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:27,640
will attack these assumptions all death
or theories of learning from a cognitive

1099
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,449
perspective

1100
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:32,879
in our last lecture next monday and
uh... on on wednesday thank you very

1101
00:48:32,879 --> 00:48:33,129
much
