1
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,809
okay

2
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,099
okay last time we talked about

3
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,980
psychopathology more or less abstractly

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,050
talk about how we think about the fire
gtm

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,469
how we are think about deviance of
normality and all of that

6
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:26,599
what i want to do today is together will
boil that more concrete about the

7
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,239
particular forms of mental illness that
we observed

8
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,890
and how we think about them

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,220
last time i find that out

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,510
making a point

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,030
psychiatric diagnosis like any kind of
that medical diagnosis

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,190
this is centrally inactive
categorization

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,330
when you have a patient purification
aristocrat restrict clinical

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:48,870
psychologist

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,409
you have a patient who's got some kind
of problem

16
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:53,680
your the first thing you have to do is
to figure out

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,789
what kind of problem it is

18
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:01,510
okay that st dot that's what diagnosis
is and in figuring out what kind of

19
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,199
problem it is

20
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,450
you essentially categorize

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,649
the illness

22
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,940
or categorize the patient

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,780
and into baltimore diagnostic categories

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,280
and for the next question is how do we
think about these categories

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,460
well classically

26
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,840
we think that we thought about these
categories

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,229
in the class accordion categorization as
proper steps

28
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:26,670
diagnostic categories

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,010
features defining features

30
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,210
symptoms that work always present in
various forms of disease

31
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,400
date these symptoms diagnostic symptoms
essentially function does

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,640
defining features of the various
diagnostic categories so that you get a

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,680
system like this which is the classic
diagnostic system where you'd have a

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,150
mental illness divided into

35
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,520
to big categories psychosis and wilson's

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,880
and then psychosis divided into two
subordinate categories manic-depressive

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,890
illness and schizophrenic

38
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,430
and schizophrenia divided into various
kinds of subtypes

39
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,290
and again in the classical veeru

40
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,230
there was a strict separation between
categories you were even argue either

41
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,260
had manic-depressive illness three had
schizophrenic

42
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,209
you're either had some form of psychosis
three had sums for monroe says

43
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,620
if you're a schizophrenic

44
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,129
you had one or the other of these four
forums on sc is a prettier

45
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:24,569
rigid distinctions

46
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:25,510
between

47
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,690
all the various kinds of categories

48
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,849
but it turns out

49
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:34,010
just as there are problems with the
classification that

50
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,519
birds and fish

51
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,230
just like a problem for the
clarification of fruits and vegetables

52
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,819
there are problems with a classification
of mental illness when we look about

53
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,070
those problems are

54
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,510
for the same time for problems

55
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,879
so for example

56
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,699
in psychiatric diagnosis weather made
her

57
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:55,130
issues affecting cycle about psychiatric
diagnosis

58
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,969
is that many patients

59
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,079
all right well shadow only a partial
expression

60
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:04,449
antoine syndrome or another

61
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,040
separation might have

62
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,200
all offensive just organs

63
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,719
and then had a meal

64
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:12,559
but not shallow ambivalence or alter zm

65
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:18,609
so disrupt rule before cardinal symptoms
of schizophrenia but not the other two

66
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,909
well you do with such a patient

67
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,589
what you do what you're doing such a
patient it'd you begin to

68
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:28,049
hedge categorization so i won't happen

69
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:29,549
was that

70
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,519
the diagnostic off the vocabulary

71
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:33,649
got extended

72
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:34,890
to have

73
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:40,339
bad terms like skilled personality
excuse article personality

74
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:41,929
for people who

75
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:47,599
kind of had some of the symptoms of
schizophrenia but didn't have full-blown

76
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,639
through the frontier okay

77
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,570
and suddenly as

78
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,670
output the category of paranoid
personality developed

79
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,419
to classify people had delusions

80
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,019
so that they had that feature all
paranoid schizophrenic

81
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,099
but they didn't have any of the other

82
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:07,290
or part of features of schizophrenia
they didn't have

83
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,609
of the associate disturbance they didn't
have the actor dhoni or whatever

84
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:13,420
so joe status

85
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,550
thirty tomato

86
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,700
both kind of absolute that's really more
like a vegetable that it is like a fruit

87
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,309
so

88
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:23,190
well out there uh... there these
gradations

89
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,130
in the audit in mental illness

90
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,269
so that patients didn't really look like
any of the diagnostic categories

91
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,750
the second problem

92
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,780
what have you had

93
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,670
you don't do that kind of many patients

94
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,879
who seem to have

95
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,460
who's going to come back in the
expression all true world war two forms

96
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,300
of mental illness

97
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,410
remember that according to the classical
bulow categorization

98
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,169
you're a good one category or another
later a fish or a bird

99
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,990
your fruit or vegetable the realistic

100
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,000
or or a triangle affiliate you can't
beat

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,790
truly care but i am into different
categories dot mental patients about

102
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,330
their who clearly

103
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,949
didn't seem to blow into different
categories

104
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:05,180
so for example

105
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,380
on very frequently encounter patients
who have similar symptoms associated

106
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,849
with schizophrenic

107
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,840
c alm

108
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,919
follett assertive disturbance

109
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,969
and also some of the all symptoms
associated with affect of disorder

110
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:25,819
sojourn what happened was that the
diagnostic vocabulary was enlarged

111
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:28,790
cargo to cover these kinds of combined
expressions

112
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,300
suddenly got terms like giver aspect of
this error

113
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,110
for patients who

114
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,100
resemblance to the front of you have to
be involved with illness represent bles

115
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,870
fiza freddy in some respects

116
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,920
that resembled affective disorder in
rather respects

117
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,170
and they also or borderline personality
for which now has an entirely different

118
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,040
meaning that its origins

119
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,669
was intended to to cover people who work
right on the board of wine

120
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:54,390
between schizophrenia

121
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:59,720
bulb donna de fective disorder solve
this problem partial and combined

122
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,360
expression

123
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,150
which we said before critique of the
classical view of categories is proper

124
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,830
sets

125
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,230
i got out of the comes to us again

126
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,800
when we look at the nature of the
diagnostic categories

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,709
by third problem

128
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:15,550
ourselves for what

129
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,780
all of the more interesting problem
openssl respects is the instability

130
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,520
diagnostic

131
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,960
of out of psychiatric diagnoses

132
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,199
if you're up and then i will let em know
okay

133
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,850
if you're a square r square we are not
going to change into something else

134
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,060
dot people with various forms of mental
illness

135
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,020
moving in and out of categorization

136
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,910
so for example you can be in the acute
trainees of schizophrenia

137
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,700
the kind of a florida

138
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,030
although the phase dot uh...
representing the initial of the initial

139
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,309
episode

140
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:54,669
why debate then move into requested

141
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:56,400
phase of the disease

142
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,760
heart

143
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,729
the disease night but i thought you
might be calm

144
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:00,450
gigabyte

145
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,099
all we're going to what's known in the
medical traders in remission

146
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:08,419
and the question is what do you do with
a person who is categorized as

147
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:12,979
headed for the friday at one point but
that doesn't seem to have schizophrenia

148
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:13,770
and other ppl

149
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,130
hydeia categorize these individuals

150
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,749
well

151
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,169
of these problems

152
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:21,860
all part of began to

153
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,620
school

154
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,480
all bother people called a quite a bit

155
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,319
and that they decided to do

156
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,229
once to style

157
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:33,400
eyes the nature of psychiatric
classification

158
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,629
instead of presenting

159
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,150
mental health workers

160
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:42,039
witless solved defining features
symptoms that we're defining features of

161
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,300
various categories of disease they'd
these at the do you have a general idea

162
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,689
now is that

163
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:50,159
rallies

164
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,699
there are more alike

165
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,400
categories defined by family resemblance

166
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,289
that look more like prototypes so we
have onset of also orthodox disorders

167
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:04,249
the organic brain syndrome so a
personality disorders or whatever

168
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:06,320
but none of these is the sociated

169
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,469
with any

170
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:08,880
singling necessary

171
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,450
and jointly sufficient

172
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,199
are defining features

173
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:12,990
instead

174
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,710
what we've got now how r diagnoses as
forty sets

175
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,100
god illnesses

176
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,469
that are described in terms of

177
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:26,589
characteristic symptoms not symptoms
that always present in every case of a

178
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,020
particular

179
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,449
well form of illness

180
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:29,949
but symptoms that

181
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:32,010
tend to be present more often

182
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,590
all of them out

183
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,480
of say that you know i have in the
diagnostic all thug a clarification

184
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:38,929
scheme

185
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,019
and allowance for quite a bit of

186
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:41,970
heterogeneity

187
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,279
within categories

188
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,589
you'll have one patient with
schizophrenia who doesn't actually

189
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:48,200
resemble

190
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,820
they would watch on some other patient
along with uh... with schizophrenia

191
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,270
so that there were no

192
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,459
no clear boundaries

193
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,610
between one form of mental illness

194
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,700
and dog and another

195
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,639
you can see this situation

196
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,689
very clearly

197
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:09,010
when you look at heart with
schizophrenia is currently diagnose

198
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,270
when pataki still afraid it was first
introduced in the early part of the

199
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,770
twentieth century

200
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,870
alaska's i thought it was defined in
terms of bloggers four days

201
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,759
associate disturbance and had only a

202
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,339
ambivalence an autism

203
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,420
and blow asserted that

204
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,380
everything every patient with
schizophrenia habit these for character

205
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,319
these four symptoms and these four
symptoms

206
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:34,759
deferring to the illness of
schizophrenia

207
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:38,619
but we don't think like that are anymore
in psychopathology

208
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,599
instead the diagnosis of schizophrenia
can be made

209
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:43,010
if a patient has

210
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,970
to learn more abenney

211
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,260
so-called

212
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,670
characteristic symptoms these are
classified as positive symptoms

213
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,699
positive symptoms are stars symptoms
that

214
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:55,020
you know people have and

215
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,610
well people

216
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,410
okay there

217
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,620
their of their president

218
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,129
in art of the negative symptoms

219
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:07,330
art are things that are absent in the
old people but president in the home

220
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,200
oh yen-dollar

221
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,310
that i have some video people present
and well people you'll see what i mean a

222
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,040
minute

223
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,359
these positive symptoms delusions

224
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:20,840
at all of the day believe solve all our
various kinds

225
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,589
hallucinations

226
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:24,180
hearing voices for example

227
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,170
disorganized speech not being able to
communicate your means all of the

228
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:29,940
affectively

229
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,920
are grossly disorganized speech

230
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,519
if you're a delegation in very pod

231
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,870
all occurring salvos of behaviors

232
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,020
these are symptoms

233
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,510
in many patients with schizophrenia

234
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,100
but tend to be absent

235
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,850
in people without schizophrenia so
they're called positive symptoms

236
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,730
these negative symptoms aspect of
flattening

237
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,220
i am all this is related to blow his
concept of edwardo near

238
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,870
many through the front of patience

239
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,310
all just don't seem to show much affect
they don't express much out and i think

240
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,300
they don't

241
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,860
smile a lot they don't smile flown a lot
to be there for that matter all energy

242
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,269
up

243
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:11,729
or difficulty in maintaining her
ideology u_s_a_ stream of thought

244
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:15,480
is bullish and difficulties and all
indian motivation

245
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,100
again

246
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,450
most people don't have flat affects most
people are very expressive if there are

247
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,860
in there a motions

248
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,110
most people don't have difficulty of

249
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,650
home of maintaining a train of thought
don't have any difficulty getting up and

250
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,150
going

251
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,270
but again

252
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:36,019
not every fifth affronted patient it's
going to have every one of these

253
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,070
in fact

254
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,820
because the diagnosis of schizophrenia
required

255
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,790
all the way that a patient have

256
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,880
two or more these characteristic
symptoms

257
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,670
you can't have it you can imagine

258
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:51,669
when a patient with schizophrenia who
has delusions and affect in flat name

259
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,430
another patient

260
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,230
who had solicitations and disorganized
speech but not delusions and not affect

261
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,319
a flattening

262
00:11:58,319 --> 00:11:59,720
itself as a step

263
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,939
the diagnosis of schizophrenia on now

264
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:06,700
and again these dot these are two or
more characteristic symptoms

265
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,619
have to be accompanied by

266
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:12,179
evidence of social or occupational
dysfunction and they have to persist for

267
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,669
more than six months

268
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:15,650
but the point is

269
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,380
all of the class these are now

270
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,140
characteristic symptoms symptoms that
are all only imperfectly correlated with

271
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,220
category membership

272
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,080
you could have

273
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,820
who had the same

274
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,340
illness

275
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,910
schizophrenic ah...

276
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,039
who look very different

277
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,440
from each other

278
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,040
similarly when you look at major
depressive disorder

279
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,020
all

280
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,710
here at the diagnosis now requires that
a patient present

281
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:47,130
five symptoms firearm or symptoms over a
period of two weeks

282
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,510
depressed mood

283
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,220
diminished interest in things

284
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,769
or weight loss

285
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:56,939
all in fact meal or hypersonic leaders
are one form of sleep disorder or the

286
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:57,440
other

287
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,410
a lot of agitation

288
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,110
all the rest of energy

289
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,390
easy alton easy feted hope it's called
easy to fatigue

290
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,450
our feelings of restlessness

291
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,719
or inability to concentrate

292
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,869
are perhaps suicidal thoughts

293
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:13,030
but again

294
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,860
not every depressed patient is going to
show after these symptoms

295
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,250
in order to be diagnosed with major
affect the disorder

296
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,550
all you have to show or you have to show

297
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,359
five or more of these symptoms

298
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:27,390
so that you can get

299
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,580
two individuals with depression

300
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,950
gordon look very different from each
other are not of heterogeneity

301
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,540
in these diagnostic categories

302
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,670
tumour examples

303
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,090
anxiety disorder

304
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:42,730
all

305
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,149
obviously

306
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:45,519
dusty fits its name

307
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,700
well u

308
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,860
gotta have excessive anxiety

309
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,470
but even excessive ags already isn't
sufficient

310
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,820
to be tapped to be go

311
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,439
diagnosed with anxiety disorder

312
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:57,960
there have to be

313
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,770
all some extra symptoms here

314
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,790
and any three will do here

315
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,059
so you can have

316
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,870
one page with anxiety disorder

317
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,079
who has restlessness

318
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,720
and is easily fatigued in his irritable

319
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,459
another patient with anxiety disorder

320
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,130
who has sleep disturbance

321
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,389
and muscle tension

322
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,679
and has difficulty concentrating

323
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,450
patients will look very different

324
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,770
from each other even though they're
carrying

325
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,350
the same diagnostic

326
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,410
ul label

327
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,360
here is the last example of this
post-traumatic stress disorder

328
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,530
all

329
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,129
there's only one necessary to develop a
symptom over here

330
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:35,330
and that is that the person actually is
exposed to travel

331
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,979
whether it's the trouble of work

332
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:39,259
where the trial of natural disaster

333
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:43,309
or the trial of being victimized
although the victim of some kind of

334
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:44,840
crime

335
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,620
exposure trauma alone

336
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,190
is not sufficient

337
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,029
qualified person for diagnosis of
post-traumatic stress disorder

338
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,429
they actually have to show some

339
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,110
symptoms of disorder

340
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,880
but again

341
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,500
the symptoms that they can show all very
very valuable

342
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,590
so that

343
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,530
one

344
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,510
person with d_t_s_ the will have
recovered memories of the trauma

345
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,109
another

346
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,720
all patients with d_t_s_ d

347
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,390
very distressed when he or she comes
into contact with the

348
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,180
dramatic incidence of again

349
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,420
oh seven out

350
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,870
this is a p_t_ esti will try to avoid
thinking

351
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,359
our boats at all about their trouble

352
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:30,469
orders will open simply detach
themselves from the source of the trauma

353
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:33,489
alone and just not some not so that's a
different ways

354
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:35,930
of has been keith usd

355
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,440
and the same illness

356
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,690
but very very different manifestations
of the illness we've moved

357
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,840
for a living

358
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,040
from diagnosis in terms of

359
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,710
singly necessary in jointly sufficient
defining symptoms

360
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,020
so that we know

361
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,000
all diagnosis is

362
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,749
more of an act of judgment

363
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:56,339
okay

364
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,249
we can't just look up a patient symptoms
of a cookbook anymore if they are you

365
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:02,880
got the four days you've got to get a
friendlier

366
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,400
you have to figure out

367
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,960
or what the pattern

368
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,329
of all of those old symptoms it is

369
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:11,580
and hello

370
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,110
how serious they are

371
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:19,979
so no we have body of research that
looks at the diagnostic process itself

372
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,240
and it turns out

373
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,969
then when you look at the kinds of
factors

374
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:30,969
that all affect clinicians certainty or
confidence in his or her psychiatric

375
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,670
psychiatric diagnosis

376
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,820
at the same kinds of factors

377
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,709
that after that us that affect a
person's

378
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:39,139
certainty or confidence

379
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:43,260
that they've classified some natural
object correctly whether itself

380
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,370
tomato oral

381
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,440
or whatever

382
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,680
so for example

383
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,580
if the patient presents

384
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,960
lots of characteristics features

385
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,119
you're more certain of your diagnosis

386
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:57,850
that if the patient only presents just a
few

387
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,490
if the patient presents

388
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,970
whole lots of feet are symptoms that are
also characteristic of some other

389
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,290
diagnosis

390
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,079
so that symptoms characteristic
alternative categories

391
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,730
that your confidence level will go down
he won't bow you won't be sure anymore

392
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,230
or exactly of whether you classify the
person correctly or not

393
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,000
the textbook cases

394
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,010
now that we learn frogs

395
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,380
when we learn how to make a diagnosis

396
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,200
all we don't we no longer expect

397
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,140
every patient bc it looks just like the
patients that are described in the

398
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,460
textbook instead

399
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,840
the textbook cases service something
like category prototypes

400
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,850
when you think about whether or not
whether or not eliza birder or whatever

401
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,630
you're going to say it all out called a
bird of the kind of looks like a sparrow

402
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,600
you don't expect backwards to look
exactly like sparrows

403
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,360
okay are the same way all of the of or
ordered all up

404
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,240
textbook cases our presided

405
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,880
just as

406
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,710
idealized examples that have lost of the
symptoms are characteristic of water and

407
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,220
other diagnosis

408
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,940
and relatively few

409
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,660
symptoms that are characteristic

410
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,130
all alternative

411
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,830
diagnoses

412
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,240
so that's how we get from symptoms the
diagnosis

413
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,710
we have

414
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,080
diagnostic categories

415
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,990
that are

416
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,960
are set out in terms of characteristic
features

417
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,809
and as with any other active
categorization

418
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:26,490
your job is

419
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,110
do the best uterine

420
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,190
make the best judgment you can

421
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,290
are matching

422
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,770
the art symptoms presented by the
patient with the character of these

423
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,340
symptoms are characteristic

424
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,429
of various

425
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:40,550
of the various diagnostic

426
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,059
categories

427
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,480
but that's not where at the process

428
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,190
stops

429
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,940
diagnosis psychiatric diagnosis is
always made in terms of symptoms

430
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,140
does the person have delusions does the
person experience hallucinations does a

431
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:02,780
person have excessive worry or is the
person excessively sad or or or whatever

432
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,670
altogether

433
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,870
we don't think that

434
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,230
the symptoms are just

435
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,210
evidence to the diagnostic process

436
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,940
but we want to do is to get to
underlined pathology

437
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,340
again in terms of the medical model
symptoms are not the disease

438
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,050
symptoms are closed by

439
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,499
the disease and what you want to use
that what you want to do

440
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,570
is to use them to other symptoms

441
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,890
to figure out not the only way in
pathology is

442
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,550
this is true for a medical doctor

443
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,710
patient comes in and says doctor i had
chest pains

444
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,090
that's the symptom

445
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,040
okay

446
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,030
then what you want to find out is one of
the person has quality of our heart

447
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:44,580
trouble

448
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,120
and if the person s for trouble

449
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,860
what kind of heart trouble it is you
always want to explain the symptoms

450
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,950
in terms of some underlying pathology

451
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,050
and in fact caucus balaji

452
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,690
no different from a medical pathology

453
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,510
these underlying pathologies or revealed
essentially by laboratory research

454
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,880
by experimental research of various
crimes that tried to

455
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,340
to try to find out

456
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,980
what did what the disease process really
is

457
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,190
disclosing the patient

458
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,880
to have the symptoms all of that he or
she is having

459
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,800
and again

460
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,549
that's parlayed exactly grandmom hidden
in the medical model

461
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:26,450
scientific medicine treats

462
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,220
diseases

463
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,630
it doesn't treat symptoms

464
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,599
new radio positioning is hey i've got a
fever

465
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:36,370
he doesn't put you in the refrigerator
to cool you off

466
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,250
okay

467
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,450
doesn't treat the symptoms

468
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,470
he says well you've got some kind of
infection so i'll give you some

469
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,750
antibiotic

470
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,929
the same kind of thing goes on

471
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:49,080
in the armed even though i've been in
psychopathology

472
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,620
now for those of you are photo following
along with slides are gonna skip

473
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,200
a bunch

474
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,750
for inferno

475
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,220
and yeah i don't know instantly

476
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,909
summary all the kinds of underline
pathologies that we talk about

477
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:05,690
u_n_ all is not in mental illness

478
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,780
in medicine

479
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,010
the underline pathologies are clear

480
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,670
sometimes the lesions to some part of
the anatomy

481
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:19,690
person suffers a lesion in the brain
coral broken bone or of war or whatever

482
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,890
sometimes there's a physiological
malfunctions

483
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,300
or some part of the bodies of operating
quite right gavel or say a heart murmur

484
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,790
earth something like that

485
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,870
o'rourke there may be some in veterans
of suicide

486
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,590
mark though some infection

487
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,680
that's gotten into the body and that
basically has to get out follow somehow

488
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,240
that wasn't the kinds of underline
pathologies we talk about in medical

489
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,779
illness

490
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:44,820
if you're

491
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,360
kandahar problem or a long problem or
cancer or or whatever psychopathology we

492
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,710
have a somewhat different list

493
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,429
first the underlines pathology sometimes
comes

494
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:58,860
in terms of what we call

495
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,370
psychological deficits

496
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,490
better intended to be

497
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,889
somehow analogous to

498
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:04,549
alm

499
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:06,399
not the psychologically analogous

500
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:08,300
two of

501
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,460
physical structure and function

502
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,660
set we fans liked

503
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,050
there is some patients

504
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,280
attentional functions

505
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,990
just aren't working right

506
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,850
okay

507
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,310
for their other mental patients who are
having difficulties atmosphere of memory

508
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,280
determined their vote with their motto
that whatever apparatus they have for

509
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,179
our

510
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,210
for remembering things isn't working of
right

511
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:30,139
are usually

512
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:32,030
uh... at least in principle

513
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,310
there's some kind of neural substrate
here is the reason the patients are

514
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,450
having difficulty

515
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,620
with attention

516
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,820
or thinking or remembering

517
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,940
is because some part of their brain
autism working or properly that i think

518
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,660
we're talking about

519
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,200
psychological deficits

520
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,000
deficits in the operation of one or
another psychological function

521
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,120
cases have psychopathology

522
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,030
mental functions are operating just find
a person's thinking clearly uh... and as

523
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,820
god good attention

524
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,150
doesn't have any problems of memory

525
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,240
what what what the undermine pathology
really is

526
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,730
is something like

527
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,560
fault some kind of

528
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,720
arnelle adaptive mental contents of the
person just

529
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,110
has the roar of idea about things

530
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,529
inappropriate thoughts

531
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,380
believes their expectations

532
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,480
as when

533
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,800
depressed people believe that are
everything above all the world autism is

534
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,610
bad

535
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,040
already reported expectations is when

536
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,690
of phobic individual although it has an
inappropriate fear of snakes

537
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,760
on sometimes the feeling of persons

538
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,880
emotions or or motives

539
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
our car somehow inappropriate

540
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,140
we think about these kinds of natural
death of mental contents

541
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,740
as often reflecting all some kind of
problem of social learning that the

542
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,100
person just

543
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,140
acquired some piece of knowledge

544
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,320
that's really good in the new in the way

545
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,460
bucknell adaptive of behavior so again

546
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,210
by analogy to the medical case

547
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,310
we have problems of

548
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,590
also

549
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,029
psychological structure

550
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:11,810
problems or psychological function

551
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,560
and that

552
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,790
because of some forms of mental illness

553
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,750
where it is just

554
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,980
persons not thinking right

555
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,649
uh... person's got bubbles wrong beliefs

556
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:23,820
all roaring expectations or whatever

557
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,420
palm

558
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:29,590
and we discover these things five means
are they are called set of methods

559
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,580
that we call experimental
psychopathology now i'm just not going

560
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,590
to talk about experimental sort of
throaty today

561
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,820
i what to do something else on entirely

562
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,669
or or

563
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:45,520
she's operably here

564
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,710
although so

565
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,580
though some friends of cycle of a star
psychopathology

566
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,680
there's a psychological deficit that is
fundamental in schizophrenia

567
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,370
we think it's something that has to do
with the attentional system in childhood

568
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,130
autism we felt there seems to be some
problem

569
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,569
thirty-odd in the in the uh...
mechanisms that relate the child

570
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:08,920
to to other people

571
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,060
and depression

572
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,970
the psychological deficit affects the
armed

573
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,430
the uh... of the the emotional system in
various ways

574
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,470
and an attention deficit disorder

575
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,129
there's again a problem at all

576
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:23,330
behavior tential system

577
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,679
but it's one that's quite different from
the problems we see in schizophrenia

578
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,070
so if you have forgotten so i have
mental illness

579
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:37,059
the underlying pathology it's best for
eleven terms of is psychological deficit

580
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:40,029
a_t_t_ fact in the psychological
structure

581
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:40,980
or function

582
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,870
uh... reforms of psychopathology

583
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:48,360
they are there aren't any psychological
deficits they died the mind is working

584
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,590
perfectly well

585
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,140
it's just got there and stuff in it

586
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,340
in five years

587
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,690
people have unwarranted fears

588
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,019
in obsessive-compulsive disorder

589
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,940
all again there are on warranted for
years and behaviors that the person

590
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,090
tries to

591
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,990
are that used to ward off the art of the
new york appeared event

592
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,770
some forms of depression

593
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,720
are best for help in terms of person
just having inappropriate

594
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,410
malad active believes about him or
herself and the world and then certain

595
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,740
psychophysiology oldest orders like are
psychosomatic ulcers

596
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,290
why we have a person whose feted
inappropriate reaction

597
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,070
who are to stress

598
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,160
again

599
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,159
mental functions are working ok it's
just that the person has

600
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,960
now look at it

601
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,760
inappropriate

602
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,290
thoughts feelings or or or desires

603
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,400
now that's how we think about mental
illness but the psychological level of

604
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,559
analysis

605
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,400
but as i said earlier

606
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,120
it's also the case for some forms of
mental illness

607
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,130
but there are a bad logical
abnormalities

608
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,319
that cause

609
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,440
the psychopathology to occur to begin
with

610
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,900
all here to bury good examples in
schizophrenia

611
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,500
very popular

612
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,940
all all hypothesis about schizophrenia

613
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,110
is that

614
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,780
milestone

615
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,929
altercations with with a prettier

616
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,760
have excess activity in a particular
neuro transmitter

617
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,770
also known as though i've known as
dopamine

618
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,299
higher levels of dopamine

619
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:24,580
or apparently at the heart all of our
schizophrenics

620
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,970
dopamine is in our transmitter that's
very importantly involved in the body of

621
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,050
the attentional system

622
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,379
and for depression

623
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:35,910
are there may be an underlying of the
biological abnormality

624
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,770
affecting another

625
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,309
neurotransmitter

626
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:41,000
are not to actually to north of effort

627
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,590
and on and and serotonin

628
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,070
apparently all levels of these nor
transmitters

629
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,970
seem to be responsible for at least some
forms of depression

630
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,510
so we get

631
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,620
psychopathology

632
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,580
is analogous to a medical pathology

633
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,049
there are symptoms are closed by

634
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:02,559
so i'm a underline disease

635
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,299
okay

636
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,390
which we can describe in psychological
terror

637
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,010
and sometimes find the source of
informal under laurin all underlying

638
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,810
biological abnormality as well

639
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,300
so the next question is

640
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,360
has mental illness come from

641
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,510
okay that is the question of ideology

642
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,170
where we got these psychological
deficits

643
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:30,270
where we get this these inappropriate
fear is inappropriate author all

644
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,130
obsessive behaviors and on and so on

645
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,809
all then it turns out

646
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:35,820
all that

647
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,770
also when you look at the origins spots
like a pathology

648
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,919
question about the elegy

649
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:46,750
you see the same kind of interactions
between nature nurture

650
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:53,060
between biology experience between genes
and the environment that we fall

651
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,280
when we were looking at

652
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:59,170
the development of a personality in the
last set of lectures

653
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,900
the production of

654
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,950
the predominant framework for
understanding

655
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,140
the origins of psychopathology

656
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,700
is known as the day that this is stress
model

657
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,809
which has

658
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:14,239
through components to it

659
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:15,649
that i got the cis

660
00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:17,360
and stress

661
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,390
the diet offices component is
essentially any predisposition

662
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,150
to sam formal five mental illness

663
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:31,010
this predisposition does not clause the
mouth of the mental illness to a car

664
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,450
that it does leave the person

665
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,170
venerable

666
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:38,950
to send form of mental illness or that
increased with

667
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,020
for that form of of mental illness

668
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,330
the idea is

669
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,420
that people

670
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,309
acquirer

671
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:47,900
one way or another

672
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,780
seven died at the system leaves the
address for all of the first time for

673
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,600
mental illness

674
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,980
the dialysis alone is not sufficient

675
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,580
cause

676
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,779
the mental illness to occur

677
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:03,310
ladder

678
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,670
each individual medics and relatively
good

679
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,280
or relatively poor adjustment

680
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,220
to whatever today at the cis factor of
dot is

681
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,309
pre more evidence that

682
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:16,350
term from medicine refers to

683
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,950
what the person's condition is before
the onset of illness

684
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,160
so some people will adapt very well

685
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,970
to whatever dialysis order caryn

686
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,370
or others board adapt although well at
all

687
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,090
but again

688
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,980
the died after cecil alone does not
cause the disease

689
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,460
but i got the cis

690
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,870
it also causes the disease

691
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,539
or only in the interaction with the
second factor

692
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,490
which is known as the stress factor

693
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,929
and i think that i have to some stress
model

694
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,430
we define stress

695
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,620
as any

696
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,770
eve event

697
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:55,020
that challenges the person's adjustment

698
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,620
stresses any event that challenges the
person's current level of adjustment or

699
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,419
current level

700
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:01,770
of adaptation

701
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,950
and it's the stress

702
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,090
combined with udya offices that then

703
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:12,559
leads to an acute episode of illness an
acute episode of is a prettier

704
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,580
oregon acute episode of of depression

705
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,590
or whatever

706
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,019
but again

707
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:23,140
stress of the stress factor all alone is
not sufficient to cause mental illness

708
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,600
to occur

709
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,089
rather

710
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:28,120
the stress factor only causes mental
illness

711
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,620
the unbearable individuals

712
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,779
in individuals

713
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:33,379
who are who are carrying

714
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:34,610
a particular

715
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,070
dari offices factor

716
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,540
it's the dialysis

717
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,080
at the stress commbank

718
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,450
that precipitate

719
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,159
but at the sort of mental illness

720
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,850
neither one alone

721
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,230
is sufficient

722
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:51,080
now you see in this kind of framework
before when we talked about

723
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,680
the interaction of the person and the
situation

724
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,129
you can think of the dialysis

725
00:31:57,129 --> 00:31:58,640
as every

726
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,220
characteristic all of the individual or
a characteristic of the person

727
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,110
you could think of the stress

728
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,280
as uncharacteristic of the environment

729
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,970
outside of the person

730
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,140
and as a indicated before it ever
lectures on personality and social

731
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,620
interaction

732
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,630
you could think about that this is the
stress as independent of each other okay

733
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,509
so here

734
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:21,870
we have

735
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,420
individuals who were low and i got the
since

736
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,460
someday offices

737
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,070
here individuals who were high

738
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,930
here individuals who have

739
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,390
low exposure to stress

740
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:36,419
hari exposure to stress

741
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:41,060
and the two factors that this is the
stress just add onto each other

742
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,840
so that

743
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,050
the more data since you've got

744
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,250
but more stress you're subjected to

745
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,980
the more likely you are

746
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,259
to have an acute episode

747
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,309
of storm form

748
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:53,250
of mental illness

749
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:53,890
burnt

750
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:58,419
because they'd i thought that this is an
stress interacting with each other

751
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:01,260
began a multiplicity of our relationship

752
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,239
so that

753
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:05,080
if you've got a low levels of dialysis

754
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,970
even with

755
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:09,910
high levels of stress you're relatively
unlikely

756
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,420
have an acute episode of mental illness

757
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,330
but if you've got high levels of diana
pisses

758
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,490
even low levels of stress

759
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,640
precipitate

760
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,380
acute episode again

761
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,639
there just to remind you that you've
seen this kind of

762
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:29,340
alms out there that that this kind of
booked on grass before

763
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,879
when we were talking about the person by
situation russian this is just another

764
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,530
example

765
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,080
so for example

766
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,720
all you can imagine that there are
various kinds of patterns

767
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,410
of the relationship between guyana
persists and stress

768
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:50,100
if you've got if you're carrying a
substantial dialysis for seven form of

769
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,950
mental illness

770
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,689
relatively little stress is going to be
required

771
00:33:54,689 --> 00:34:00,700
to precipitate an acute episode and by
virtue of that high degree of dialysis

772
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,259
you made bog bog make

773
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:05,390
are relatively poor adjustment

774
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,570
even before

775
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,980
the acute facility

776
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,629
family

777
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:14,539
if an individual is subjected to test
radical level stress

778
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:17,549
even the middle of a war zone for
example or be in the middle of some

779
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:19,399
natural disaster

780
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:20,849
then you might get

781
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:22,940
the stress levels that are so high

782
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,419
as to precipitate uh... audio an acute
episode of mental illness

783
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:31,509
even in people who are relatively low
organ risk

784
00:34:31,509 --> 00:34:33,379
so they can cut it compensate

785
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:34,699
for each other

786
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:38,789
so if you have got out this is levels
that are more or less mobile

787
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:41,409
the likelihood barbecued episode

788
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:43,690
is going to be a function of the amount
of stress

789
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,179
you experience

790
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,500
if the amount of stress you experienced

791
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,029
is more or less within normal

792
00:34:50,029 --> 00:34:50,690
limits

793
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,720
that nearly all the likelihood of having
an acute episode

794
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,700
is going to be determined by the amount

795
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,889
of play out this is

796
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,279
your carry

797
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:00,509
now let's just illustrate

798
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:02,770
with the couple's dog concrete

799
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:07,499
actual empirical examples how this of
how this works

800
00:35:07,499 --> 00:35:08,249
first

801
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:11,849
let's look at our old friend the twins
study

802
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:12,529
okay

803
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:14,769
to look at dramatic

804
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:19,579
glad i got the seas disguise a prettier
here we have summary data

805
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:25,469
for three major forms of mental illness
schizophrenia bipolar affect of disorder

806
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:27,480
so-called manic-depressive illness

807
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,759
and you know polar affective disorder

808
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:34,449
and we have letter cold concordance
rates

809
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:35,829
offer these illnesses

810
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:38,420
for but i don't think i think i'd
ethical twins

811
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,589
and for does iconic fraternal twins
concordance rate simply means

812
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:45,619
death warrants win

813
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:47,359
as a particular illness

814
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,219
what's the likelihood that the other
twin is also going to have illness and

815
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:54,510
what i want you to see here is

816
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:59,170
that even for a major mental illness
like schizophrenia that concordance rate

817
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,609
is remarkably low

818
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:02,469
okay

819
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:04,499
if when twin has schizophrenia

820
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:07,759
there's only about a thirty eight
percent chance that the other twin will

821
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:09,719
also have schizophrenic

822
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:11,320
same thing four

823
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,980
all occurred before at for affect a
disorder on two major depression

824
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,880
depressive illness

825
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,900
if won't win has depression

826
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,179
forty percent will be a forty percent
chance that the other twin will have

827
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:24,629
depression

828
00:36:24,629 --> 00:36:28,890
here from all installed bipolar disorder
so-called manic-depressive illness

829
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,869
but even better

830
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:34,059
the concordance rate is far from one
hundred percent

831
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:37,629
presumably in these three forms of
mental illness

832
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:40,749
part of the dialysis is generic in
nature

833
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:45,429
that there is some kind of hereditary
factor that his accounting ford that

834
00:36:45,429 --> 00:36:46,649
that is

835
00:36:46,649 --> 00:36:50,189
disposing people filter this form of
mental illness

836
00:36:50,189 --> 00:36:52,450
that genes are not

837
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,499
decisive

838
00:36:53,499 --> 00:36:57,299
because individuals who are genetically
identical

839
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,330
can be very different from each other

840
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,259
with respect to whether they actually
terry are the disease

841
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:04,750
are you have an example

842
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,780
where it appears to be the case

843
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,099
that there is a genetic factor

844
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:12,359
we don't know exactly what it is
actually we don't have any idea what it

845
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,180
is

846
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,519
there's a bit

847
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:17,119
bogged evidence like this strongly
suggests

848
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,989
that there is a genetic factor

849
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:21,919
that will leave individuals at with

850
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:23,759
for schizophrenia

851
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:26,269
or at risk for bipolar disorder

852
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:31,839
or at risk for depressive or a disorder
because it

853
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,750
what makes a difference here

854
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,879
apparently

855
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,549
the different environments

856
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:38,500
in which these individuals

857
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,239
or car or a living

858
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:46,380
so what kinds of unfolded and all
environmental factors all might there be

859
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,720
it turns out

860
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:52,770
that there is a good relationship
between socioeconomic status and

861
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,300
schizophrenic suggesting that

862
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,010
no distress associated with low
socioeconomic stratos

863
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,209
but there's no socioeconomic status

864
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:03,879
alm orthotic people

865
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:04,789
all

866
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:06,630
this in people with schizophrenia

867
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:12,570
there is the history of copied failures
profound loss is profound frustrations

868
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:12,959
again

869
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,329
of stress factor

870
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:18,390
itself is insufficient to cause
schizophrenia

871
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:24,390
but which may come back in with a
genetic diagnosis to lead to ons gov

872
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,909
august of episode

873
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:28,789
similarly family mala jostled

874
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:31,759
and our communication deviance within
the family

875
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:34,689
are these are all environmental
contributions

876
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:37,450
they don't have anything to do with the
gene

877
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,779
or they they seem to be environmental
factors in the background of many

878
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:44,979
schizophrenic patients that seemed to
precipitate

879
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:46,620
are beyond beyond set

880
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,579
all of the of the illness

881
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:51,369
here's another example

882
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:52,940
not the flat major

883
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,229
our foremost mental illness and harrison
conduct order disorder

884
00:38:57,229 --> 00:39:01,799
all right this is work by upshaw i'm
casting at the university of london all

885
00:39:01,799 --> 00:39:03,679
and his soul and his colleagues

886
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:04,829
who are interested

887
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:08,090
in the interaction of dialysis and
stress

888
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,250
leading to

889
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,470
antisocial behavior disorder conduct
disorder

890
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,489
in the auto invoice

891
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:18,510
and they suggested on the basis of there
are the bear analyses

892
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,109
that there's a particular gene

893
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:25,039
particular for became known as the
n_r_a_ all a gene

894
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,390
which promotes

oxidase okay

896
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:32,699
that

897
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:36,119
deficits factor of judah genetic
diagnosis factor

898
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:39,619
for all pretty social or the behavior
disorder

899
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:40,349
at that

900
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:45,319
this gene in another seth is not
sufficient

901
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:47,939
closed conduct disorder to occur

902
00:39:47,939 --> 00:39:48,630
rather

903
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,759
face although the proposed

904
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:54,899
individuals caryn this genetic dialysis

905
00:39:54,899 --> 00:39:57,200
if they're exposed to

906
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,670
or higher levels of stress like a
history of not all of our of

907
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,539
maltreatment

908
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:03,809
that that would be a dof

909
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:06,740
of the pushed and pushed the child over

org into

911
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:12,049
into a syndrome of antisocial behavior
disorder that they're actually able to

912
00:40:12,049 --> 00:40:12,900
study this

913
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,949
on in new zealand

914
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:17,859
well it in a daughter that authority

00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:18,559
group of

916
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,369
more than a thousand new zealand or
their children

917
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:24,760
because of the vote in new zealand
health system works

918
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,090
these kids recess

919
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,450
or every other year

920
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,199
from the time they were three

921
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:30,559
until they work

922
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:33,399
well into into their twenties

923
00:40:33,399 --> 00:40:35,990
and watch has been his colleagues did

924
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,009
when i was too

925
00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:38,799
duet genetic analysis

926
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:41,480
and determine wider these

927
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,259
children

928
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:47,799
bad of particular version of the nato a
gene or not

929
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:49,450
and then also

930
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,910
on assess the history of maltreatment in
the family

931
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,580
and then determined whether any of these
kids

932
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,759
actually met the diagnostic criteria

933
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:01,179
for adolescent

934
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:01,950
disorder

935
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,599
here are the results of the study

936
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:06,190
physically to levels

937
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,280
the so that the their children

938
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,699
were classified

939
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:14,059
unter meserve two levels of m_ a_ l_ a_
activity

940
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:16,589
low levels were high levels

941
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:20,949
and then they were also classified in
terms of their exposure

942
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:24,020
altered mental history of maltreatment
at dot at home

943
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,409
where they had no limit

944
00:41:25,409 --> 00:41:28,920
or maybe some or very very severe

945
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,159
and you've got here

946
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,859
the number the percentage five children

947
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:39,729
with various combinations of and they
have a activity and a history of stress

948
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:40,969
the percentage of them

949
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:45,759
that actually allowed deadly diagnosis
about a less than conduct disorder and

950
00:41:45,759 --> 00:41:46,969
that you see here

951
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:52,759
is a perfect example rb interaction or a
diagnosis and stress

952
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:53,950
well levels

954
00:41:56,209 --> 00:42:00,599
that's the dialysis factor that's
carried on the jeans

955
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:01,229
combined

956
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:03,729

maltreatment

958
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:10,119
eighty five percent of those kids will
end up with a diagnosis of adolescent

here heart children with that

961
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:20,180
buddies but exactly the same two that i
think that this is low levels of a daily

activity

963
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:24,570
levels of maltreatment

964
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,619
and watch

965
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:26,319
lower

966
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,920
likelihood of actually developing

00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,899
conduct disorder

968
00:42:30,899 --> 00:42:34,819
are individuals with high levels of the
railway activity

969
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:37,389
and even when they're exposed to

970
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,159
severe

971
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,840

972
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,719
at home

973
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:43,210
thirty all likelihood of actually

974
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,609
having allison conduct disorder is
relatively low

975
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:50,209
it's the specific avaricious

976
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:50,809
combine

977
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:53,050
this any specific stress

978
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,509
that leaves

979
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:55,529
the illness

980
00:42:55,529 --> 00:42:58,640
low levels of their own if you don't
have the dialysis

981
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,670
you're very unlikely to get the illness

982
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:03,049
but even if you've got the diagnosis

983
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:04,920
only if you're exposed to

984
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,059
high levels of stress

985
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:12,309
the adolescent conduct disorder on
actually all occur

986
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:16,929
on here is another example again from
test these laboratories are very very

987
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,809
active all of the laboratory

988
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:20,439
but even at the

989
00:43:20,439 --> 00:43:24,749
the upon diagnostic category does major
depressive illness

990
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:27,090
and they had a all hypothesis

991
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,899
that the specific gene known as five h t
t

992
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:35,339
albeit it is implicated in the on and
the price of all the details

993
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:36,380
all again

994
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,589
on it so it's involved with m_e_l_

995
00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:40,989
homes and

996
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:42,190
again they didn't think that

997
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,560
the genetic it padberg

998
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,440
diagnosis was decisive

999
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,950
rather the genetic

1000
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:53,319
endowment interacts with a history of
stressful life events they thought

1001
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:56,229
to produced by

1002
00:43:56,229 --> 00:43:59,299
alot to produce

1003
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:00,099
depressive illness

1004
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:03,630
a case like dead at the same kind of
study

1005
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:07,630
but they didn't then they went to the
debate in the cargo study

1006
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:08,280
assessed

1007
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,460
the dialup the uh...

1008
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:14,009
give the individuals in terms of their
genetic endowment

1009
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:17,030
this gene five h t t dean

1010
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,760
or comes in basically

1011
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,650
four forms

1012
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,819
powerdvd get consider member get two
chromosomes

1013
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:24,709
two shorts

1014
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:27,119
or shorten along along in a short

1015
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,170
or to lawrence

1016
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,659
also did

1017
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:31,839
hurt dot org

1018
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,040
individuals who've got at least one
short only all of the five h t teaching

1019
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,830
here individuals who don't have any of
the short a little

1020
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:42,299
and i think that we counted the number
of stressful events

1021
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:44,129
experienced by these individuals

1022
00:44:44,129 --> 00:44:46,650
from the ages of twenty one to twenty
six

1023
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,890
and then determine

1024
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:51,380
whether they were depressed at age

1025
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,459
and hear are the results of this

1026
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:59,670
prayer individuals with the short
version but the five h_d_t_v_ genotype

1027
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,570
that is they're tearing at her one

1028
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,820
or two

1029
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,679
short oleoyls of the gene

1030
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:09,010
here are individuals who are carrying
the lawn

1031
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,040
version of the five h_d_t_v_

1032
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,029
arjuna type

1033
00:45:12,029 --> 00:45:15,400
and no or other classified as well in
terms of

1034
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,000
harmony stressful events the experience
during that five year period

1035
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,969
known

1036
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:23,049
three were for

1037
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:25,609
and that once again what the pattern is
like

1038
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:29,230
the short version of the five h_d_t_v_
dean

1039
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:31,760
appears to be a genetic diagnosis

1040
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,229
fork the passion

1041
00:45:33,229 --> 00:45:37,919
that carry majhi nh does not

1042
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,039
bomb

1043
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:42,140
mean necessarily that you're going to
get depressed

1044
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,310
it's or delete this genotype

1045
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:48,259
even combination with high levels of
stress

1046
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:49,349
but notice

1047
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:53,749
that if your ex if you're exposed to
high levels of stress

1048
00:45:53,749 --> 00:45:55,900
but you've got the loan

1049
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,189
version of the five h_t_t_p_

1050
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:01,999
you're no more likely to become
depressed that if you've got no stress

1051
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:03,009
at all

1052
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:05,869
is these specific interaction

1053
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:12,869
other particular genetic endowment with
any history off stress that leads to

1054
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:15,720
part of that that leads to depressive
illness

1055
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,759
are better able

1056
00:46:17,759 --> 00:46:18,929
excellent example

1057
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:22,599
also beat out advancers stress of the
model

1058
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:25,769
both doesn't distrust model inaction

1059
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:26,820
then they are

1060
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,809
again this is from of the kathy's poem

1061
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:32,219
or laboratory

1062
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:35,630
or if you know we have to have the
simpsons trusted pathological showing

1063
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:36,229
its

1064
00:46:36,229 --> 00:46:39,440
this is not just normal shyness the
citadel

1065
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,559
really

1066
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:41,740
withdrawn

1067
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:46,150
are part of the heart of the inhibition
of the presence of strangers

1068
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,230
and again that that the farthest
etiology

1069
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,869
was implicated part in this

1070
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:54,459
also they are going to assess

1071
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:57,739
the president's all of the short version

1072
00:46:57,739 --> 00:47:00,170
b_-five h_d_t_v_ or a gene

1073
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:04,369
and then looked at all agreed that these
individuals in terms of

1074
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:06,150
in terms of social support

1075
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,169
in their family environment

1076
00:47:09,169 --> 00:47:10,869
here is

1077
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,329
pattern of

1078
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:13,890
shyness

1079
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:15,099
here we have

1080
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:19,449
high levels of the haber lynnette or in
addition very very high levels

1081
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:21,489
of although the showings

1082
00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:26,599
low levels ovr shyness fear and the
level of social of support

1083
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:28,670
look at the pattern of results

1084
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,839
if you're carrying the the short

1085
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,060
version of the farthest e_t_ gene and
you have a low levels of social support

1086
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,789
you know very unlikely

1087
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:42,199
fitted to develop pathological shyness

1088
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:45,439
but if you've your terrain short

1089
00:47:45,439 --> 00:47:46,529
version of the gene

1090
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:50,150
but you've got very strong social
support in your family and in your

1091
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,049
neighborhood

1092
00:47:51,049 --> 00:47:54,929
you're no more likely to develop
pathological shyness all of them dot

1093
00:47:54,929 --> 00:47:56,579
than anybody else

1094
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:57,199
similarly

1095
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:59,229
if you've got the war

1096
00:47:59,229 --> 00:48:01,509
version all of the gene

1097
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:04,339
even if you're in or very poor

1098
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,390
social environment

1099
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:07,380
very low levels of social support

1100
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,930
you're not going to

1101
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:13,400
or score high in behavioral innovation
it's a specific

1102
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,309
lakshman

1103
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,680
between genetic diagnosis

1104
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,519
and sawmill form alva larval

1105
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:22,799
all blown though

1106
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:24,140
between genetic biographers

1107
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,030
and some kind of stress or

1108
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,889
well social support

1109
00:48:27,889 --> 00:48:31,420
marv albert history of maltreatment
history of stress or whatever

1110
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,269
but this is how the day after so
stressed model all works

1111
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:38,979
here is another version from the same of
from the same study

1112
00:48:38,979 --> 00:48:41,039
people terrain

1113
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:43,079
short version of the gene

1114
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:45,119
much at risk

1115
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,669
the arm

1116
00:48:46,669 --> 00:48:48,589
for pathological shriners

1117
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:49,640
when the gene

1118
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,099
is combined with low levels volvo

1119
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:53,549
of social support

1120
00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:54,919
this is the way it goes

1121
00:48:54,919 --> 00:49:01,319
all the way all of them that this is the
way it goes all the way along

1122
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:03,650
or finish the thought next time

1123
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,209
dot i want to just prepare you

1124
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:12,269
because usually we think about that the
system data battles and stress as bad a

1125
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:15,219
logical and environmental respectively

1126
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:18,619
that dialysis is always something like a
gene

1127
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:19,749
and distress or

1128
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:23,679
is always something in the social
environment that's not necessarily the

1129
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:24,579
case

1130
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:26,260
and i'll make that point

1131
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,420
on monday

1132
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,440
thank you very much

1133
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,140
have a good weekend
