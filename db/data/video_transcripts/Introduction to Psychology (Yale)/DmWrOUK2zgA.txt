Professor Paul Bloom:
Two follow-ups on

2
0:16
yesterday's--I'm sorry,
on Monday's lecture.

3
0:19
One is that somebody came up
after class and asked when the

4
0:24
preference for your own language
emerges in development and

5
0:30
fortunately,
studies pretty much exactly

6
0:33
this sort of infant
understanding.

7
0:35
She knew the answer.
There's been studies looking at

8
0:38
newborn babies finding that
pretty much the moment they pop

9
0:42
out they favor their own
language over other

10
0:45
language--over other languages.
And this suggests that they are

11
0:49
listening while in utero,
while in the womb,

12
0:52
to the rhythms of their
language and developing a

13
0:55
preference for it.
A second issue is,

14
0:57
I talked very briefly about a
court case in which the person

15
1:02
was--said at a moment where
someone else was pointing a gun

16
1:07
at a police officer,
"Let him have it!"

17
1:10
and a police officer was killed.
And that person was charged

18
1:14
with murder but I admitted I
didn't actually know how things

19
1:17
turned out and was kind enough
to do extensive research.

20
1:21
Well, he went to Wikipedia and
[laughter]

21
1:24
found out the answer.
The answer is he was tried and

22
1:28
found guilty for murder.
He was then subsequently

23
1:33
pardoned.
In fact, he was pardoned in

24
1:36
1988, which is really nice
except he was executed in 1957.

25
1:42
But they did it into a movie.
So, it's a movie.

26
1:47
Okay.
So, I want to do today,

27
1:49
for the first part of the
lecture, is continue the

28
1:52
language lecture and then move
to perception,

29
1:54
attention, and memory.
And what we had spoken about

30
1:57
was--We first talked about
universals of language,

31
2:01
then moved to some detail about
the different aspects of

32
2:05
language including phonology,
morphology, and syntax.

33
2:09
We discussed the ways in which
language does the amazing things

34
2:13
it does, including the fact that
language has used arbitrary

35
2:17
science or sounds to convey
concepts,

36
2:20
and that languages exploit a
combinatorial system including

37
2:25
recursion to put together these
symbols into a virtually

38
2:29
limitless set of meaningful
sentences.

39
2:32
We then talked about
development and made some

40
2:35
remarks about the developmental
time course – talking about

41
2:39
the emergence of language from
babies to – where babies are

42
2:42
really good at learning language
to you who are not,

43
2:46
whose brains have atrophied,
whose language capacities are

44
2:52
dead.
Final issue is to shift to

45
2:55
animals.
Now that we know something

46
2:58
about language,
we could then ask do animals

47
3:02
use--possess the same sort of
language?

48
3:05
And if not, can they learn it?
Now, there is absolutely no

49
3:09
doubt at all that nonhuman
animals possess communication

50
3:12
systems.
This has been known forever and

51
3:16
is not a matter of controversy.
And if you want to use the term

52
3:20
"language" to mean
"communication," then the answer

53
3:22
is obviously "yes."
Dogs and bees and monkeys have

54
3:25
language.
If you want to use language

55
3:28
though in the more technical,
narrow sense as anything that

56
3:32
has the properties that we
discussed earlier,

57
3:36
using English and ASL and
Spanish and so on as our

58
3:39
background, the answer's almost
certainly "no."

59
3:42
Animal communication systems
fall into sort of one of three

60
3:47
categories.
Either there is a finite list

61
3:49
of calls, so vervet monkeys,
for instance,

62
3:52
have a small list of calls to
convey different warnings like

63
3:56
"attack from a snake" or "attack
from a leopard."

64
3:59
There is a continuous analog
signal.

65
4:02
So, bee dance,
for instance,

66
4:04
works on this way.
Bee dance communicates the

67
4:06
location of food sources but
doesn't do it in any

68
4:09
syntactically structured way.
Rather, the intensity of the

69
4:12
dance corresponds to the
richness of the food source.

70
4:15
And then, you get things like
random variation on a theme such

71
4:19
as birdsong.
But what you don't find in any

72
4:22
real sense is phonology,
morphology, syntax,

73
4:25
combinatorial systems or
arbitrary names.

74
4:29
Now, this much is not
particularly controversial.

75
4:32
There gets to be a lot of
controversy though.

76
4:35
This is the summary about
nonhuman communication systems.

77
4:37
It gets more controversial when
we get to famous cases of

78
4:42
primates trained by humans such
as Kanzi,

79
4:47
Nim Chimpsky,
and other famous primates that

80
4:50
you may well have seen on the
Discovery channel and other

81
4:55
venues.
And this is fairly

82
4:56
controversial.
If you read the Gray textbook,

83
5:00
while nothing in it is
particularly inaccurate,

84
5:03
I think Gray is actually a
little bit too credulous,

85
5:06
too believing in the claims
that have been made about the

86
5:09
abilities of the animals.
So many scientists argue,

87
5:13
for instance,
that animals like Kanzi,

88
5:16
even if they can be said to be
learning words at all,

89
5:20
learn very few of them.
And it takes them extensive

90
5:24
years of training to learn,
unlike a normally developing

91
5:29
child who could learn a word in
a day or a word in an hour.

92
5:33
The utterances often have order
but this order tends to be very

93
5:38
limited and lacks the recursive
properties.

94
5:41
And in fact,
the lack of recursion is not

95
5:44
controversial.
Finally, the utterances of

96
5:48
chimpanzees--trained chimpanzees
are extremely repetitive so what

97
5:54
you often see on TV and in
documentaries is sort of a

98
5:59
sampling.
And the sampling could often be

99
6:02
very impressive but if you take
just what they say at random it

100
6:06
tends to look like this.
This is typical chimpanzee

101
6:09
utterances just taken at random:
"Nim eat, Nim eat.

102
6:13
Drink, eat, me Nim.
Me gum, me gum.

103
6:16
Tickle me, Nim play.
Me eat, me eat.

104
6:20
Me banana, you banana,
me you give.

105
6:22
Banana me, me eat.
Give orange,

106
6:26
me give, eat orange,
me eat orange."

107
6:29
Lila Gleitman once commented
that if any normally developing

108
6:33
child spoke like this,
his parents would rush him

109
6:37
screaming to a neurologist.
There's a broader question

110
6:42
here, which is,
"Why would we ever expect a

111
6:45
chimpanzee to learn a human
language?"

112
6:48
We don't normally expect one
species to have the capacities

113
6:52
associated with another species.
So, bats use echolocation to

114
6:57
get around and some birds
navigate by the stars,

115
7:01
but there's not an active
research program seeing if cats

116
7:04
can use echolocation or dogs
could navigate by the stars.

117
7:07
And I think one reason why you
might be tempted to think,

118
7:10
"well, of course chimps must be
able to learn language" is

119
7:13
because you might be caught in
the grips of some bad ideas

120
7:16
about language.
So, one idea is you might say,

121
7:20
"Look.
Chimps should use language

122
7:22
because chimps are so smart."
But the response to this is,

123
7:26
"they are smart but we know
that smart isn't enough."

124
7:32
We know that the human capacity
for language is not totally a

125
7:35
result of smartness.
There are smart children who,

126
7:38
due to some deficit in their
language capacity,

127
7:41
don't speak or understand a
language.

128
7:43
So, the smartness of
chimpanzees does not in itself

129
7:46
demonstrate that they should be
able to learn language.

130
7:49
You might also point out
correctly that chimps are our

131
7:51
nearest evolutionary relatives,
which is right,

132
7:54
so you--one would expect on the
face of it--it's not

133
7:58
unreasonable to expect us to
share a lot of abilities with

134
8:03
them.
On the other hand,

135
8:05
we split from them a long time
ago and plainly humans are

136
8:09
different from chimps.
And there was five million

137
8:13
years either way and that's more
than enough time for a language

138
8:17
capacity to evolve.
Now, none of this is to say

139
8:22
that the study of nonhuman
communication systems isn't

140
8:27
interesting.
From my own--This is my

141
8:30
personal opinion I'll raise
here.

142
8:33
From my own opinion,
the study of the attempts to

143
8:36
try to teach chimpanzees,
or gibbons, or gorillas,

144
8:39
a human language like ASL are
misguided.

145
8:42
It would be as if a team of
monkeys kidnapped a human child

146
8:46
and tried to train him how to
hoot like a monkey.

147
8:49
It might be enjoyable but it
does not seem to give us any

148
8:52
rich insights.
What I think is a lot more

149
8:54
interesting is the study of
these animal communication

150
8:57
systems in the wild.
There's a linguistics of human

151
9:00
language that has delineated the
principles that underlie all

152
9:04
human languages.
It would be as extraordinarily

153
9:07
interesting to attempt the same
linguistic program to the other

154
9:11
communication systems used in
the wild such as the cries of

155
9:14
vervet monkeys and bee dance.
So, this brings the section on

156
9:18
language to a close but I want
to tell you a few things we

157
9:21
didn't talk about.
One of the problems with an

158
9:24
Intro Psych course is we have to
whip through a lot of topics

159
9:27
very fast.
So, if you were to take a

160
9:29
course that focused directly on
language you might learn,

161
9:32
for instance,
more about language in the

162
9:34
brain, something touched about
very briefly in the textbook but

163
9:37
something that has a large
literature associated with it.

164
9:40
Similarly, and related to this,
there's language disorders,

165
9:44
disorders like aphasias and
disorders like specific language

166
9:48
impairment and dyslexia.
There is the study of language

167
9:52
perception and production.
How is it that we do this

168
9:54
amazing feat of understanding
and producing words in a

169
9:58
fraction of a second?
Where does that ability come

170
10:01
from?
There is the study of reading

171
10:03
which is, in many ways,
different from the study of a

172
10:07
language.
Remember when Darwin described

173
10:10
language as an instinct.
He carefully distinguished it

174
10:13
from other things that don't
come natural to us including

175
10:16
reading.
And in fact,

176
10:18
reading is difficult.
Reading is a cultural

177
10:20
invention, not every human has
it.

178
10:22
And unlike language,
reading is acquired with

179
10:25
tremendous difficulty over many
years.

180
10:27
On the other hand,
reading plainly intersects with

181
10:30
language.
It's a new way of conveying

182
10:32
language, moving out from speech
to writing.

183
10:35
And the psychology and
neuroscience of reading is thus

184
10:39
very interesting.
There's bilingualism and

185
10:42
multilingualism.
The questions people in this

186
10:45
room typically are going to be
interested in is does it matter

187
10:50
for how well you learn language
whether you're learning one or

188
10:54
two or three or four.
How is it that a multilingual

189
10:58
encodes all these different
languages inside a single brain?

190
11:03
And so on.
Finally, a very hot issue is

191
11:07
that of the relationship between
language and thought and I'm

192
11:12
actually--A few years ago I
taught an entire seminar called

193
11:16
"Language and Thought" devoted
to precisely this question.

194
11:20
And it's a cool question and it
could break up into two very

195
11:24
general questions.
One is, "Is language necessary

196
11:27
for abstract thought?"
And one way to answer that

197
11:30
question is to look at creatures
without language like babies and

198
11:34
chimpanzees and see how smart
they are.

199
11:37
It might be that they're
not--that they're very smart,

200
11:39
in which case it would suggest
you don't need language for

201
11:41
abstract thought.
On the other hand,

202
11:43
it might be that they have
certain cognitive limitations,

203
11:46
which would suggest that
language is essential for

204
11:48
abstract thought.
Then there's the related

205
11:51
question.
Even once you know a language,

206
11:53
does the structural properties
of the language that you know

207
11:57
affect the way you think?
And the claim that the language

208
12:00
you know affects how you think
is sometimes described as

209
12:04
linguistic relativity or the
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.

210
12:07
So for instance,
there's a lot of research

211
12:09
looking at speakers of different
languages such as English versus

212
12:13
Korean and seeing whether
structural differences in these

213
12:16
languages affect how you think.
Now, some of this work is

214
12:19
discussed in the readings,
the book--the Gray textbook,

215
12:22
and the selections from The
Norton Anthology. And this

216
12:26
makes up--again,
I've showed this to you on

217
12:29
Monday--your reading response
where you have to address this

218
12:33
question and take your best shot
at answering it.

219
12:37


220
12:40
What are your questions about
language?

221
12:42


222
12:54
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

223
13:00
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question was raised,

224
13:06
"Some people learn languages
easier than others and how do we

225
13:09
explain this?"
And the answer is you could ask

226
13:13
the question both with regard to
first language learning – so

227
13:17
some children learn language
very quickly,

228
13:20
some are very slow – and also
with regard to second language

229
13:23
learning.
Some of you are breezing

230
13:25
through your second language
requirement here at Yale.

231
13:28
Others are struggling and
miserable.

232
13:31
And there's considerable
variation.

233
13:34
There's the story of Einstein
who was very slow to learn

234
13:37
language and didn't speak at all
until he was four.

235
13:41
And in fact,
he was a--He said his first

236
13:43
words when all of a sudden he
was having supper with his

237
13:46
parents and he put down the
spoon and he said,

238
13:49
"The soup is too hot."
And his parents stared in

239
13:54
astonishment and said,
"You've never spoken before."

240
13:56
And he said,
"Well, up to now everything's

241
14:01
been fine."
[laughter]

242
14:04
It's not a true story.
[laughter]

243
14:07
The question of why and where
these differences come from,

244
14:11
nobody really knows and it's
surprisingly hard.

245
14:15
There's a slight advantage for
being female.

246
14:18
Girls are slightly more
advanced in language than boys

247
14:21
but it's not a big one and you
need a hundred people to just

248
14:24
see it statistically.
There's a big genetic factor.

249
14:29
If your parents learned
language quickly and learned

250
14:32
other languages quickly,
you are more likely to.

251
14:34
But an understanding of the
brain bases of these differences

252
14:39
or the cognitive bases or the
social bases is just--is largely

253
14:43
an open question.
Yes.

254
14:46
Student: What happens
when parents [inaudible]

255
14:50
Professor Paul Bloom:
This is actually more the norm

256
14:54
around the world than the
situation in the United States

257
14:58
where kids are exposed to a
single language.

258
15:01
What happens is children learn
both languages.

259
15:05
Children are very good,
as adults are,

260
15:07
of distinguishing different
languages on the basis of their

261
15:10
sound system and their rhythms
so they don't typically confuse

262
15:13
them.
And then they just learn more

263
15:15
than one language.
And that's actually more the

264
15:19
average state of affairs around
the world.

265
15:22
Yes.
Student: You said that

266
15:27
people who are right-handed
learn languages [inaudible]

267
15:32
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question is about the

268
15:37
hemispheric specialization for
language.

269
15:41
And I don't have actually much
more to say than what I said

270
15:44
before, which I agree is deeply
unsatisfying.

271
15:47
If you're right-handed,
language is probably in the

272
15:50
left side of your brain.
How many people here are

273
15:53
left-handed?
For you we don't know.

274
15:56
It varies.
Some of you have it in the left

275
16:00
side.
Some of you have it in the

276
16:01
right side.
For some of you it's kind of

277
16:03
diffuse.
Now, why is this?

278
16:06
And in fact,
why are some people

279
16:08
right-handed and others
left-handed in the first place?

280
16:11
Those are really good questions.
Yes.

281
16:16
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

282
16:28
Yes.
I'll--Yes, that's--I'll answer

283
16:32
that question.
And unfortunately,

284
16:34
it's going to be the last one
and then I'll go to vision.

285
16:36
The question is,
"Does learning more than one

286
16:38
language cause you to learn them
slower than just learning one

287
16:42
language?"
And it would stand to reason

288
16:44
that it would.
There's a finite amount of

289
16:46
mental resources.
If I'm just learning English,

290
16:48
I use all of it for English.
And if I'm learning English and

291
16:51
Spanish I kind of got to split.
And you'd expect them to be

292
16:54
each learned slower.
It's one of the surprises of

293
16:57
the study of language
development that that

294
17:00
common-sense view does not
appear to be true.

295
17:03
Children learning more than one
language seem to show no deficit

296
17:08
relative--in each of their
languages, relative to a child

297
17:12
learning just one language.
In other words,

298
17:15
if I am just learning English
and I'm a kid and you're

299
17:18
learning English and Spanish and
you're a kid,

300
17:20
you'll reach the milestones in
English the same time I will.

301
17:25
Your extra learning of Spanish
doesn't seem to affect you.

302
17:28
There doesn't seem to be any
detriment for learning multiple

303
17:32
languages.
Another question which comes up

304
17:35
is, "Is there any cognitive
deficit?"

305
17:38
In other words,
some people have argued that

306
17:40
learning multiple languages
sometimes harms children in

307
17:42
certain ways.
This is a claim that's been

308
17:44
made in Quebec,
for instance,

309
17:46
over the debate over how
children should be taught

310
17:48
English and French.
It does not appear to be the

311
17:51
case.
There appears to be,

312
17:53
as far as we know,
no down side to learning many

313
17:57
languages when you're young.
Does that answer your question?

314
18:02


315
18:07
I want to move now to the topic
that will take us through today

316
18:11
and through the beginning of
next week – perception,

317
18:15
attention, and memory.
And I'm putting them together

318
18:19
instead of treating them as
separate lectures because

319
18:22
there's a sense in which they're
the same story.

320
18:26
You see a scene.
You see this scene and you're

321
18:30
looking at it and you're
perceiving it.

322
18:32
It's coming through your eyes
and you're interpreting it and

323
18:35
you see something.
You see a man and you see a

324
18:37
house.
If you were to shut your eyes,

325
18:40
you could still hold that scene
in memory.

326
18:42
And a week later,
if I'm to ask you about that,

327
18:49
"What season was it?"
you would do pretty well.

328
18:54
This is the story I want to
talk about – how we do this.

329
18:58
And in the course of this I
want to make a series of claims

330
19:03
that go something like this.
For perception,

331
19:06
I want to first persuade you
the problem of perception's hard

332
19:10
and that successful perception
involves educated and

333
19:13
unconscious guesses about the
world.

334
19:15
For attention,
I want to suggest that we

335
19:17
attend to some things and not
others and we miss a surprising

336
19:21
amount of what happens in the
world.

337
19:23
For memory, there are many
types of memory.

338
19:27
The key to memory is
organization and understanding.

339
19:29
And you can't trust some of
your memories.

340
19:33
How many of you remember where
you were at 9/11?

341
19:39
Many of you are wrong.
And I am never going to

342
19:43
persuade you of this because you
have certain memories.

343
19:48
And you could tell the story.
Everybody could tell the story

344
19:51
where they were when the towers
went down.

345
19:54
But clever psychologists on
September 12 said,

346
19:57
"Let's do a study."
And they asked people,

347
20:00
"Where were you yesterday when
you heard the news?"

348
20:03
And they told them.
And then they went back to them

349
20:06
later, a year later,
two years later,

350
20:08
and said, "Tell me about what
happened September 11."

351
20:12
And they said,
"I remember totally where I

352
20:14
was.
I have a very--" And then--And

353
20:16
often the story was wrong.
There is a lot like that which

354
20:20
we're going to talk about.
And the biggest moral then--so,

355
20:24
I put it really,
in really big print--We are

356
20:28
often wrong about our
experiences, both of the present

357
20:32
and of right now.
So, let's start with perception.

358
20:37
There is a story--I went to
graduate school at MIT and there

359
20:41
was a story there about Marvin
Minsky who is the A.I.

360
20:45
guru.
He--If you've heard the

361
20:47
words--the phrase "artificial
intelligence," that was him.

362
20:51
And if you heard the claim that
people are nothing more than

363
20:55
machines made of meat--also him.
Well, there's a story where he

364
20:59
was doing work on robotics and
he was interested in building a

365
21:02
robot that could do all sorts of
cool things that's like a robot.

366
21:06
And the story goes the robot
had to among--had to write--had

367
21:12
to see the world.
It had to be able to pick up

368
21:15
things and recognize people and
see chairs and navigate its way

369
21:19
and Minsky said,
"That's a tough problem.

370
21:22
It's going to take a graduate
student a whole summer to figure

371
21:25
it out."
And he assigned it to a

372
21:27
graduate student for a summer
project.

373
21:29
Visual psychologists,
perception psychologists,

374
21:33
love that story because the
study of computer vision and

375
21:37
robotics vision and the attempts
to make machines that can

376
21:42
identify and recognize objects
has been a profound failure.

377
21:47
There is, at this point,
no machine on earth that could

378
21:52
recognize people and objects and
things at the level of a really

379
21:57
dumb one-year-old.
And the reason why is that it's

380
22:01
a much harder problem than
anybody could have expected.

381
22:06
Well, what makes it such a hard
problem?

382
22:10
Well, one reason why you might
think it's an easy problem is

383
22:13
you say, "Okay.
We have to figure out the

384
22:15
problem of how people see.
Well, here's what we do."

385
22:19
You're in--You're over there
and here's your eye.

386
22:23
And somehow it has to get to
this television monitor and then

387
22:25
you look at it and that'll solve
the problem of how you see.

388
22:28
So, sometimes people say, "Hey.
I hear the eye flips things

389
22:31
upside down.
I guess this guy is going to

390
22:33
have to get used to looking at
things upside down.

391
22:36
That's an interesting problem."
No.

392
22:39
That's not the way to look at
it because that doesn't answer

393
22:43
any questions.
That just pushes the question

394
22:46
back.
Fine.

395
22:46
How does "he" see?
We're not answering anything.

396
22:50
Similarly, although the
Terminator's view of the world

397
22:53
may correspond to that ,
that doesn't solve any problem

398
22:56
of how he actually sees.
So, he has all these numbers

399
22:59
shooting out there.
Well, he has to read the

400
23:01
numbers.
He has to see this.

401
23:02
This is my iTunes.
[laughter] That's inadvertent.

402
23:10
Here's the right way to think
about perception.

403
23:15
You got the eye,
which is very ugly and bloody,

404
23:19
and then around here you have
the retina.

405
23:22
And the retina is a bunch of
nerve cells.

406
23:24
And the nerve cells fire
at--for some stimulus and not

407
23:29
others.
And from this array of firings,

408
23:32
"firing… not firing…
firing… not firing," you have

409
23:37
to figure out what the world is.
So, a better view is like this.

410
23:44
The firings of the neurons
could be viewed as an array of

411
23:48
numbers.
You have to figure out how to

412
23:51
get from the numbers to objects
and people, and to actions and

413
23:57
events.
And that's the problem.

414
23:59
It's made particularly a
difficult problem because the

415
24:03
retina is a two-dimensional
surface and you have to infer a

416
24:06
3D world from a two-dimensional
surface.

417
24:09
And this is,
from a mathematical point of

418
24:12
view, impossible.
And what this means is that

419
24:15
there--For any two-dimensional
image there is an indefinite

420
24:19
number of three-dimensional
images that correspond to it.

421
24:23
So for instance,
suppose you have this on your

422
24:27
retina, an array of light shaped
like that .

423
24:31
What does that correspond to in
the world?

424
24:33
Well, it could correspond to a
thing just like that that you're

425
24:37
looking for or it could
correspond to a square that's

426
24:40
tilted backwards.
And so, you have to figure out

427
24:43
which is which.
And the way we solve this

428
24:47
problem is that we have
unconscious assumptions about

429
24:52
how the world works.
Our minds contain certain

430
24:56
assumptions about how things
should be that enable us to make

431
25:01
educated guesses from the
two-dimensional array on to the

432
25:05
three-dimensional world.
And I purposefully did not make

433
25:09
the slides available for this
class ahead of time because I

434
25:12
don't want people to cheat,
but there are several points

435
25:15
where you could look at the
slides and confirm that some of

436
25:18
the things I'm going to tell you
are actually true.

437
25:20
And I want to give you three
examples.

438
25:22
One is color.
And I'm going to conflate here

439
25:25
color and brightness.
The other is objects.

440
25:28
The other is depth.
First, the problem of color.

441
25:32
How do you tell a lump of coal
from a snowball?

442
25:36
Well, that's a lump of coal and
that's a snowball,

443
25:40
and it's from Google images.
How do you know which is which?

444
25:46
Well, a lump of coal you say is
black and a snowball is white.

445
25:50
How do you know?
Well, maybe you have on your

446
25:53
retina--Your retina responds to
sort of color that hits it.

447
25:58
It's oversimplified,
but let's assume that this is

448
26:00
true.
So, this is black coming out

449
26:02
and that's white and that's how
you tell.

450
26:06
But in fact,
that can't be right.

451
26:09
It can't be right because
objects' color is not merely a

452
26:13
matter of what material they're
made of but of the amount of

453
26:17
light that hits it.
So, as I walk across the stage

454
26:21
I fall into shadow and light,
and none of you screams out,

455
26:26
"Professor Bloom is changing
colors!"

456
26:29
Rather, you automatically
factor out the change in

457
26:34
illumination as this is
happening.

458
26:38
And this could actually be
quite striking.

459
26:40
So, you see this display over
here.

460
26:43
Take a look at those two blocks.
I take it you see this one as

461
26:49
lighter than that one.
You do.

462
26:52
You might imagine this is
because this strip is lighter

463
26:57
than this but it isn't.
They're the same.

464
27:01
And you won't believe me until
you actually print it out and

465
27:06
take a look, but they are in
fact the same.

466
27:09
I'll show it to you.
And you could say I'm tricking

467
27:11
you but this is the way it
works.

468
27:13
There's the close-up.
So, remember we're comparing

469
27:15
this and this.
Now, let's take away other

470
27:19
parts of the environment and
you'll see they're the same.

471
27:26
Now you say, "But hold it.
This can't be the same as this"

472
27:32
but the answer is--goes like
this.

473
27:35
We know shadows make surfaces
darker.

474
27:39
We don't know this like "Here's
something I know."

475
27:42
Rather, we know this in that
it's wired up in our brains.

476
27:47
So when we see a surface in
shadow we automatically assume

477
27:52
that it's lighter than it looks,
and we see it as lighter.

478
27:58
And you could show this by
removing the cues to the shadow.

479
28:01
And you see it as it really is.
And this is an illustration of

480
28:05
how the information to your eyes
is just one bit of information;

481
28:09
the degree of light coming from
a single source is one bit of

482
28:13
information that you use to
calculate certain assumptions

483
28:17
and come to a conclusion.
Here's a different kind of

484
28:21
example: Objects.
You see this and you

485
28:24
automatically and intuitively
segment it into different

486
28:28
objects.
You segment it into a man and a

487
28:31
house and birds and trees.
How do you do this?

488
28:36
It turns out,
to program a computer to

489
28:38
segment a scene into different
objects is hugely difficult and

490
28:42
the question of how we do it is,
to some extent, unknown.

491
28:47
But one answer to this question
is there are certain cues in the

492
28:51
environment that are signals
that you're dealing with

493
28:54
different objects.
And these cues are often

494
28:57
described as Gestalt principles.
So, one example is "proximity."

495
29:02
When you see things that are
close to each other,

496
29:05
you're more likely than not to
assume that they belong to the

497
29:08
same thing.
There's "similarity."

498
29:11
That display could correspond
to an indefinite number of

499
29:15
objects but you naturally tend
to see it as two.

500
29:18
You do one with one texture
pattern, the other with the

501
29:22
other texture pattern.
"Closure."

502
29:25
The fact that this is a closed
square here suggests it's a

503
29:29
single object .
"Good continuation."

504
29:32
If you had to judge,
this could just as well be two

505
29:35
shapes, one that runs from A to
C, the other one that runs from

506
29:40
D to B.
But you don't tend to see it

507
29:42
that way.
Rather, you tend to see it as

508
29:44
one that runs from A to B,
the other one that runs from C

509
29:48
to D.
"Common movement."

510
29:50
If things move together they're
a single object.

511
29:53
And "good form."
You see the object over there .

512
29:57
In the absence of any other
information, you might be

513
30:00
tempted to say that's a single
thing, a plus sign maybe.

514
30:04
This , because it has lousy
form, you're more tempted to say

515
30:08
it's two things,
one thing lying on top of each

516
30:11
other.
And these are the sort of cues,

517
30:14
expectations;
none of them are right.

518
30:17
There's cases where they could
all fool you.

519
30:21
But these are useful cues that
guide our parceling of the

520
30:25
world, our segmenting of the
world into distinct objects.

521
30:29
Here they are summarized .
And here's a case where they

522
30:32
fool you .
So you might think,

523
30:34
if you're suggestible,
that there is a triangle here.

524
30:40
And this is a case where there
are certain cues driving you to

525
30:44
think that there's a triangle
here.

526
30:46
There is, however,
no triangle here.

527
30:48
If you cover up these little
Pacmen here, the triangle goes

528
30:53
away.
Similarly, there is no square

529
30:55
in the middle .
There is no square.

530
30:58
It's very Matrix.
And these are illusions because

531
31:03
these are cues that there should
be a square there,

532
31:08
the regularity of form.
Finally, "depth."

533
31:12
You see this and you don't--You
see it on one level as a flat

534
31:17
thing.
Another level you look inside

535
31:19
the picture and you see,
for instance,

536
31:21
the man is in front of the
house.

537
31:23
You look at me and you see the
podium.

538
31:26
And if you have a terrible
neurological disorder you see

539
31:29
this strange creature that's
half podium leading on to a

540
31:32
chest and up to a head that's
sort of--the top of him is

541
31:35
wiggling and the podium staying
still.

542
31:38
If you are neurologically
normal, you see a man walking

543
31:41
back and forth behind a podium.
How do you do that?

544
31:44
Well, this is really a problem
because, I could give you a

545
31:49
technical reason why vision is
hard,

546
31:53
but crudely,
you got a two-dimensional

547
31:55
retina and you have to figure
out a three-dimensional world.

548
31:58
How do you do it?
And the answer once again is

549
32:02
assumptions or cues.
There are certain assumptions

550
32:06
the visual system makes that
aren't always right and in fact,

551
32:10
in cases of visual illusions,
can be wrong but will guide you

552
32:14
to perceive the world in a
correct and accurate way.

553
32:18
So for example,
there is binocular disparity.

554
32:22
This is actually a sort of
interesting one.

555
32:24
This is the only depth cue that
involves two eyes.

556
32:27
If I look at you pretty close,
the image I get here and the

557
32:32
image I get here are somewhat
different while--or I have to

558
32:38
focus my eyes together to get
the same image.

559
32:42
If I look at you in back,
they're almost identical

560
32:45
because the further away,
given the two eyes that are

561
32:48
static, the closer the images
look.

562
32:50
And it's not,
again, that you say to

563
32:52
yourself, "Oh.
Back there an orange.

564
32:55
It's the same image in my right
eye and my left eye.

565
32:57
You must be far away."
Rather, unconsciously and

566
33:00
automatically you make
estimations on how far people

567
33:04
are in depth based on binocular
disparity.

568
33:08
There is "interposition."
How do you know I'm in front of

569
33:12
the podium and the podium's not
in front of me?

570
33:14
No.
How do you know the podium's in

571
33:17
front of me?
Well, from where I'm standing

572
33:20
it's right.
How do you know the podium is

573
33:22
in front of me?
Well, because I'm walking here

574
33:26
and then it cuts into me.
And unless I'm going through a

575
33:30
grotesque metamorphosis,
what's happening is it makes

576
33:33
sense to say I'm moving behind
the podium.

577
33:36
Interposition.
You take the guy.

578
33:38
How do you know the guy is
standing in front of the house?

579
33:40
Well, because there is--you see
all of him and he's blocking a

580
33:47
lot of the house.
There's relative size.

581
33:51
How far away am I?
Well, if you looked at me and

582
33:55
you had to estimate how far away
I am, part of the way you'll

583
33:59
figure that out is you know how
tall a human's supposed to be.

584
34:03
If you thought that I was fifty
feet tall, you would assume I'm

585
34:08
further away than I am.
And so, your judgments on size

586
34:13
dictate your judgments about
distance.

587
34:16
Usually, this cue isn't
necessary but if you look at the

588
34:19
Empire State Building--If you go
into a field and you see a tower

589
34:24
and you look,
your judgment of how far away

590
34:27
the tower's going to be depends
on your knowledge of how tall a

591
34:32
tower should be.
If it's this tall, you say, "Oh.

592
34:36
It must be--" And then you'd be
surprised.

593
34:38
There's texture gradient,
which I'll explain in a second,

594
34:44
and linear perspective,
which I'll also explain in a

595
34:49
second.
Texture gradient goes like this.

596
34:52
Remember the problem we had
before.

597
34:54
How do you know if that thing
is this object or an object in

598
35:00
and of itself?
Well, the answer is things with

599
35:04
textures will show themselves
because the textures will get

600
35:08
smaller from a distance.
Now, logically,

601
35:11
this could still be a single
thing standing upright with just

602
35:15
dots going up smaller.
But the natural assumption is

603
35:19
the reason why the dots recede
in this regular fashion is

604
35:23
because it's receding in depth.
Classic illusion – the

605
35:28
Mueller-Lyer illusion.
People will see this as longer

606
35:34
than this .
It's not.

607
35:36
If you don't believe me,
print it out and measure it.

608
35:39
Related to the Ponzo illusion,
once again people see this one

609
35:44
as--you get illusions named
after you when you discover

610
35:48
these--this one as longer than
this .

611
35:51
Again, it's not.
What's going on here?

612
35:53
Well, the top line looks longer
even though it isn't.

613
35:59
And one explanation for why is,
these other lines in the scene

614
36:04
cause your visual system to make
guesses about distance.

615
36:09
And then you correct for
distance by making assumptions

616
36:13
about size.
If you have two lines--You'll

617
36:16
get--We'll get in more detail in
a second, but if you have two

618
36:20
lines and they take up the same
amount of space on your retina,

619
36:24
but you believe that one is 100
feet away and the other's 50

620
36:28
feet away, the one that's 100
feet away you will see as bigger

621
36:32
because your brain will say,
"Well, if it takes up just this

622
36:36
much space but it's further
away, it must be bigger than

623
36:39
something that's closer and
takes up that much space."

624
36:42
And that's what goes on here.
For the top line,

625
36:45
for the Mueller-Lyer illusion,
we assume that this is further

626
36:49
away and this is closer based on
the cues to distance.

627
36:53
And the cue is factored in.
And because we assume that this

628
36:57
is further away,
we assume it must be bigger to

629
37:00
take up the same space as this
which is closer.

630
37:03
Similarly for the Ponzo
illusion.

631
37:05
There's linear perspective.
Parallel lines tend to recede

632
37:09
in distance.
If this top one is further away

633
37:12
than this but they take up the
same size in your eye,

634
37:16
this one must be bigger and you
see it as bigger.

635
37:20
And the book offers more
details on how these illusions

636
37:25
work.
I'm going to end with an

637
37:27
illusion that I'm not even going
to bother explaining.

638
37:30
I'll just show it to you
because you should be able to,

639
37:32
based on thinking about these
other illusions,

640
37:35
figure it out.
It was developed by Roger

641
37:37
Shepard.
Well, you know that.

642
37:40
And they are called Shepard
tables .

643
37:42
And the thing about it is,
these look like two tables.

644
37:45
If you ask people--You don't
frame in terms of here's a

645
37:48
lecture on visual perception.
You ask people,

646
37:50
"Which of these tables would be
easier to get through a door if

647
37:53
you have a thin door?"
People would say the one on the

648
37:56
left.
This one looks sort of thicker

649
37:58
and harder to get through.
This one looks longer and

650
38:01
leaner.
In fact, they're the same size.

651
38:04
What I mean by that is that
this is exactly the same as this

652
38:13
.
Now, I'm going to prove it to

653
38:15
you by showing you something
which took me--on the computer

654
38:19
which took me about seven hours
to do.

655
38:21
And nobody's going to believe
it because I could have faked

656
38:24
it.
But if you want,

657
38:25
print it out and do it
yourself.

658
38:27
You just take a piece of paper,
put it on here.

659
38:29
Then you move it and the same.
I showed it to somebody and

660
38:38
they called me a liar.
Anyway, you could do it

661
38:41
yourself in the privacy of your
own home or study.

662
38:45
But what I'd really like you to
do after you do it is say,

663
38:50
"Okay.
Fine.

664
38:52
Why does this one look longer
and thinner than this one?"

665
38:55
And the answer is the same
answer that will explain the

666
38:58
Mueller-Lyer illusion and the
Ponzo illusion,

667
39:00
having to do with cues to depth
and the way your mind corrects

668
39:06
the perception of depth.
And that's all I have to say at

669
39:12
this point about perception.
I want to move now to attention

670
39:18
and memory and I'm going to
treat attention and memory

671
39:22
together.
We are fascinated with memory

672
39:26
and, in particular,
it's particularly interesting

673
39:30
when memory goes wrong.
It's particularly fascinating

674
39:35
what happens in cases of
amnesia.

675
39:39
So for example,
I need a volunteer who is

676
39:42
willing to do a little bit of
acting, a very little bit,

677
39:47
an incredibly little bit.
Excellent.

678
39:50
Okay.
So well, you just stay there.

679
39:51
So pretend you have amnesia.
Okay?

680
39:54
What's your name?
Student: I don't know.

681
40:00
Professor Paul Bloom:
Perfect.

682
40:00
I'm really glad you said that.
That's the wrong answer because

683
40:03
you don't have total amnesia.
You still remember English.

684
40:06
Okay.
It's very clever.

685
40:09
Okay.
So you couldn't have lost all

686
40:12
your memories.
You have English.

687
40:14
You --So we'll do you.
What's your name?

688
40:19
Oh.
He looks puzzled but he still

689
40:22
maintains bowel and bladder
control so he hasn't forgotten

690
40:27
everything.
[laughter]

691
40:29
Now, I always lose the third
volunteer in that demo.

692
40:34
So, what I'm saying is that
memory is a hugely broad

693
40:40
concept.
It includes autobiographical

694
40:43
memory, which is what we
standardly think.

695
40:46
That's a perfectly rational
response.

696
40:48
When I say somebody's losing
their memory,

697
40:50
"Oh.
I have a movie about somebody

698
40:52
losing their memory," you don't
imagine a person in diapers.

699
40:55
You imagine the person walking
around, having sex with cool

700
40:58
people and saying,
"Where am I?"

701
41:00
And [laughter]
so what you imagine is you

702
41:03
imagine them losing their
autobiographical memory,

703
41:06
their sense of self.
But of course,

704
41:09
knowing English is part of your
memory and knowing how to stand

705
41:13
and knowing how to chew and
swallow are all things that

706
41:17
you've learned,
that you've--that have been

707
41:20
molded by experience.
There's another distinction

708
41:23
which is going to come in
regarding amnesia,

709
41:26
which is there's broadly two
types of amnesia.

710
41:29
They often run together,
but one type of amnesia is you

711
41:33
lose your memory of the past.
Another type of amnesia--That's

712
41:38
the Matt Damon amnesia.
Another type of amnesia though

713
41:42
is you lose the ability to form
new memories.

714
41:46
And here's a film of a man who
had exactly this problem.

715
41:51
He was a world-renowned choir
director and he suffered viral

716
41:55
encephalitis which led to brain
damage which destroyed most of

717
42:00
his temporal lobes,
his hippocampus,

718
42:03
and a lot of his left frontal
lobe.

719
42:05
It could be--It could have been
worse in that he retains the

720
42:09
ability to talk.
He seems to be--He's not

721
42:12
intellectually impaired.
He just can't form new memories

722
42:16
and so he lives in this
perpetual "now" where just

723
42:21
nothing affects him and he
feels--This has not always

724
42:25
happened.
There's more than one of these

725
42:28
cases and it doesn't always
happen like this,

726
42:31
but he feels continually reborn
at every moment.

727
42:34
And we'll return to this and
then ask what's going on here.

728
42:40
But there's a few themes here.
I want to, before getting into

729
42:44
detail about memory,
I want to review some basic

730
42:46
distinctions in memory when we
talk about memory.

731
42:49
So crudely, you could make a
distinction between sensory

732
42:53
memory, short-term memory,
which is also known as working

733
42:56
memory, and long-term memory.
Sensory memory is a residue in

734
43:00
your senses.
There's a flash of lightning.

735
43:03
You might see an afterimage.
That afterimage is your sensory

736
43:08
memory.
There's somewhat of a longer

737
43:11
echoic memory for sounds.
So as somebody is talking to

738
43:14
you even if you're not paying
attention you'll store a few

739
43:17
seconds of what they're saying,
which is sometimes,

740
43:20
when somebody's talking to you
and you're not listening to them

741
43:23
and they say,
"You're not listening to me."

742
43:25
And you say, "No.
You were talking about--" and

743
43:28
pick up the last couple of
seconds from echoic memory.

744
43:31
There's short-term memory.
Anybody remember what I just

745
43:37
said?
If you did, that's short-term

746
43:40
memory--spans for a few minutes.
And then there's long-term

747
43:44
memory.
Anybody know who Elvis is?

748
43:46
Do you know your name?
Do you know where you live?

749
43:49
Your long-term memory store
that you walk around with and

750
43:53
you're not going to lose right
away.

751
43:55
When we think about amnesia in
the movie sense,

752
43:59
we think of a certain loss of
long-term memory associated with

753
44:04
autobiographical personal
events.

754
44:07
There is a distinction between
implicit and explicit,

755
44:10
which we'll talk about it in
more detail.

756
44:12
But explicit,
crudely, is what you have

757
44:14
conscious access to.
So, what you had for dinner

758
44:18
last night.
You could think back and say,

759
44:21
"I had this for dinner last
night."

760
44:22
Implicit is more unconscious.

761
44:25


762
44:28
What the word--what certain
word--what the word "had" means,

763
44:32
how to walk,
how to ride a bicycle,

764
44:34
that you might not be able to
articulate and might not even be

765
44:39
conscious of but still have
access to.

766
44:41
There's a distinction between
semantic memory and episodic

767
44:45
memory.
Semantic memory is basically

768
44:48
facts, what a word means,
what's the capital of Canada,

769
44:54
and so on.
Episodic is autobiography,

770
44:57
is what happened to you.
That Yale is in New Haven is

771
45:05
semantic.
That you went on vacation away

772
45:09
from New Haven last week,
it would be episodic.

773
45:14
There is encoding stores and
retrieval, which refers to

774
45:18
different levels of what happens
in memory.

775
45:21
Encoding is getting the memory
in, as when you study for a test

776
45:26
or you have an experience.
And storage is holding the

777
45:30
memory.
And retrieval is getting the

778
45:34
memory out.
Finally, retrieval is often

779
45:37
broken, conveniently,
into recall versus recognition,

780
45:41
where recall is when you just
pull it out of memory and

781
45:45
recognition is when you
recognize what corresponds to

782
45:48
something in the past.
Anybody remember what color tie

783
45:52
I had on two days ago?
Oh.

784
45:55
Okay.
Well, that would be impossible

785
46:00
to remember but if I asked you,
"Is it purple or is it orange?"

786
46:03
that would be much easier.
[laughter]

787
46:12
Now, you could break up,
crudely, the memory into

788
46:16
stages.
So you start that sensory

789
46:18
memory is just the stuff that
comes in leading to short-term

790
46:22
memory, leading to long-term
memory.

791
46:25
And this stage theory is
something which we'll discuss in

792
46:29
more detail.
But this leads us to the issue

793
46:33
of attention.
How do you get memory from your

794
46:37
sensations, from what you're
hearing?

795
46:40
I'm speaking to you.
You're hearing me.

796
46:42
How does it ever get in to the
other systems?

797
46:45
What decides what's remembered
and what's not?

798
46:47
There's all sorts of things
happening to you now.

799
46:49
The seat of your chair is
pressing against your butt.

800
46:55
You wouldn't say, "Oh.
I want to remember this forever.

801
46:57
The seat's pressing against my
butt."

802
47:00
[laughter]
Your neighbor is exuding a

803
47:02
certain sort of smell.
You're thinking about something.

804
47:05
Your eyes follow him.
Not everything gets in memory.

805
47:07
You'd go mad if you tried to
remember everything.

806
47:10
You can't.
So, what determines what gets

807
47:13
into memory?
Well, one answer is "attention

808
47:17
does."
And attention is--could be

809
47:20
crudely viewed as a flashlight,
a spotlight on experience that

810
47:26
willingly zooms in on something
and makes it memorable.

811
47:31
Attention has certain
properties.

812
47:33
Some things come from
attention--to attention

813
47:36
effortlessly and automatically.
Here's an example.

814
47:40
You're going to see an array of
letters here.

815
47:43
One of them's going to be green.
When you see the green one,

816
47:49
please clap.
[laughter]

817
47:53
No, not this green one.
[laughter]

818
47:57
There's going to be another
slide.

819
48:01
Okay.
You're ready now.

820
48:10
but there's going to be an "o."
When you see it clap.

821
48:16
Okay.
Sometimes it's work.

822
48:19
Find the red "o."
[laughter] It's harder.

823
48:35
Sometimes attention is
involuntary.

824
48:40
I need a volunteer.
And all I want to do is I want

825
48:45
to show you colors on the screen
and I'd like you to name the

826
48:48
colors as they come out.

827
48:49


828
48:52
Do you want this?
Student 1: I'm

829
48:54
colorblind.
Professor Paul Bloom: Oh.

830
48:57
[laughter]
The first one is easy.

831
48:58
See.
This is--You have to just go

832
48:59
down the colors .
Anybody?

833
49:01
Okay.
Student 2: Red,

834
49:07
green, blue,
black, green,

835
49:08
blue, red, blue,
black, red.

836
49:10
Professor Paul Bloom:
Excellent.

837
49:15
[applause] Okay.
Now these.

838
49:17
These will be words but just
name--Okay, you.

839
49:20
Just name the colors.
Student 3: Green,

840
49:25
red, blue, black,
blue, red, green,

841
49:28
black, red, blue.
Professor Paul Bloom:

842
49:31
Perfect.
Now, we'll go back to you,

843
49:33
same deal, words.
Student 4: Red,

844
49:35
blue, green -- Professor
Paul Bloom: No,

845
49:37
no, no.
Huh uh.

846
49:38
Don't--I know you can read.
The colors.

847
49:41
Student 4: Okay.
Sorry.

848
49:43
Okay.
Blue, green,

849
49:45
red, green, black,
green, blue,

850
49:48
black, red, Professor Paul
Bloom: Very good actually.

851
49:55
[laughter]
That's known as the Stroop

852
49:59
effect.
Being an expert reader,

853
50:02
as you are, your knowledge of
reading, your attention to what

854
50:07
the words meant,
subverted your desire to do the

855
50:11
task.
You couldn't make that go away

856
50:14
even if you wanted to.
If somebody gave you $1,000 to

857
50:17
read this as fast as you read
this, and as fast as you read

858
50:21
this, you'd be unable to.
You can't block it.

859
50:24
There is some work--There are
some interesting discoveries

860
50:29
about attention.
I have a demonstration here.

861
50:32
I'd like people actually--It's
important--Some of you may have

862
50:36
seen this before.
It's important for you to be

863
50:39
silent throughout it.
What you're going to see is

864
50:42
you're going to see two teams of
basketball players.

865
50:45
One of them is going to have
white T-shirts.

866
50:52
The other one will have black
T-shirts.

867
50:54
They'll be passing balls back
and forth.

868
50:57
What I'd like you to do is
count in your head how many

869
51:02
passes the white team does with
the ball.

870
51:06
[laughter]
What number did people get?

871
51:07
Okay.
Did anybody notice anything

872
51:12
unusual?
[laughter]

873
51:13
Did anybody not notice anything
unusual?

874
51:15
Okay.
Some people did not notice

875
51:18
anything unusual.
Those who didn't see anything

876
51:22
unusual, watch this again and
just watch it.

877
51:26
[laughter]
About 50% of people when

878
51:28
counting, who have never seen
this before don't notice

879
51:32
anything.
But then when you're not

880
51:34
counting it's kind of obvious
what you're missing.

881
51:36


882
51:52
[laughter]
And this is one demonstration

883
51:55
among many of the fact that when
you're attending to something

884
52:00
you have a very small window of
attention and you lose the focus

885
52:05
on other things.
Here's another different

886
52:10
example.
I'd like people to watch a

887
52:13
movie and pay attention very
closely to what happens in the

888
52:17
movie and try to remember this.
How many of you noticed

889
52:20
something odd in that movie?
How many of you didn't?

890
52:24
Okay.
Now, everybody look at the

891
52:29
scarf, the color of the plates
and the food,

892
52:33
among other things.
The phenomena,

893
52:36
in general, has been called
"change blindness."

894
52:40
And what it is is we tend to
be--when there's a focus of

895
52:44
attention focused in a certain
way,

896
52:46
we tend to be oblivious to
other things that go on in the

897
52:49
environment.
Often it is,

898
52:51
in fact, quite difficult when
there's a change in scene to

899
52:55
notice what changes and what
stays the same.

900
52:59
So, in this final demo,
there's just going to be two

901
53:07
pictures flicking.
Could you clap when you see

902
53:12
what's different between the two
pictures?

903
53:13


904
53:30
[applause]
[laughter]

905
53:31
I myself am terrible at these
and so I have a lot of sympathy.

906
53:33
How many people never saw it?

907
53:34


908
53:46
[laughter] Good.
That's very impressive.

909
53:56
[laughter]
One more time with a different

910
53:57
one.

911
53:57


912
54:14
[applause]
Did anybody not see it?

913
54:16
Be honest.
I'll give you another try.

914
54:18


915
54:33
[applause] Okay.
I'll put you out of your misery.

916
54:35


917
54:45
[laughter]
This is work by Dan Simons and

918
54:48
it's part of an extraordinarily
interesting body of work on

919
54:53
what's known as "change
blindness."

920
54:56
And what this means is,
the phenomena is,

921
55:00
we have a very narrow focus of
attention and huge changes can

922
55:05
happen that we are oblivious to.
This is why,

923
55:09
in movies, there are so
many--so much difficulty with

924
55:12
continuity changes.
Dan Simons is also famous for

925
55:15
having brought this outside of
the laboratory in some classic

926
55:19
experiments and I'm trying to
get the film corresponding to

927
55:23
them.
What he did was that he did

928
55:25
this great study in the Cornell
campus where he was--where what

929
55:29
happened is they would get some
unsuspecting person walking

930
55:32
through campus and some guy
would come over and say,

931
55:35
"Excuse me, Sir.
I'm lost.

932
55:38
Could you help me with
directions?"

933
55:40
And have a map and then the
person would say,

934
55:43
"Sure."
And then there'd be two

935
55:45
construction workers holding a
door.

936
55:47
And these guys were going to
rudely bump between these two

937
55:51
characters and then the
experimenter gets switched with

938
55:54
another guy.
So now, when these two guys

939
55:57
walk away, the subject is
standing there with an entirely

940
56:00
different person.
[laughter]

941
56:02
What's interesting is nobody
notices.

942
56:07
[laughter]
They notice if the person

943
56:09
changes sexes.
"Didn't you used to be a woman?"

944
56:13
[laughter]
And they notice if the

945
56:16
experimenter changes races,
but most other changes they're

946
56:20
oblivious to.
There's another experiment.

947
56:23
I think Brian Scholl did this
one but it may have been Dan

948
56:27
Simons where what happens is a
subject comes in to the lab.

949
56:32
They say, "If you're going to
do an experiment with us,

950
56:35
you need to sign the human
subject form."

951
56:38
Hands him the form,
the experimenter.

952
56:40
The subject signs the form.
The experimenter takes the form

953
56:43
and says, "Thank you.
I'll put it down here."

954
56:45
Goes down here and then a
different person pops up.

955
56:49
[laughter] People don't notice.
And there's a certain level on

956
56:53
which we're oblivious to
changes.

957
56:56
What's weird is we don't
see--we don't think we are.

958
56:59
We think we see the world as it
is and we don't know--notice

959
57:02
that when we're attending to
something;

960
57:05
everything else gets blanked
out.

961
57:07
And so about 50% of people who
have never seen this demo

962
57:10
before, the gorilla demo,
they don't notice the gorilla.

963
57:14
And there's--you couldn't
imagine anything more obvious.

964
57:18
The gorilla study was actually
done a very long time ago.

965
57:23
And it was originally done in a
different way but I'll show it

966
57:28
to you just because this is the
original study and now that you

967
57:33
all know what to expect--Oh,
not that one.

968
57:37
Oops.
Nope.

969
57:45
That's actually--If you looked
at that quickly,

970
57:47
it's a current Yale professor.
Oh.

971
57:50
I'm never going to get my DVD
back.

972
57:52
Anyway, I'll show you the other
demo on--next week.

973
58:01
I will.
[laughter]

974
58:05
Any questions about attention
and memory at this point?

975
58:08
Yeah.
Student: [inaudible]

976
58:13
Professor Paul Bloom:
Yeah.

977
58:16
Why does it work that way?
Why is it--Why do things that

978
58:20
become very practiced become
automatic and involuntary?

979
58:24
It's a good question.
I don't know.

980
58:27
We know that they do.
We know that once you--that you

981
58:31
can't not read once you know how
to read.

982
58:34
You also can't not listen.
If I'm talking to you and I'm

983
58:40
extremely boring,
but I'm talking to you,

984
58:43
it's very hard not to listen.
You can't shut off your ears.

985
58:47
You could put your fingers in
them but you can't shut off

986
58:50
your--You also can't shut your
eyes without actually shutting

987
58:53
them.
You can't say,

988
58:54
"This is a disgusting movie.
I'm not going to attend to it."

989
59:00
[laughter]
So, that's not answering your

990
59:02
question.
It's just saying that your

991
59:04
observation is a right one and a
more general one.

992
59:07
When you're good at something
and you're over-practiced,

993
59:11
it becomes involuntary and you
cannot stop it.

994
59:14
Okay.
Well--Oh.

995
59:16
One more in back.
Yes.

996
59:19
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

997
59:21
What now?
Sorry.

998
59:22
Over there.
Yeah.

999
59:24
Student: [inaudible]
right before his accident?

1000
59:28
Professor Paul Bloom:
Did he remember things before

1001
59:30
his accident?
Yes.

1002
59:31
He had some amnesia of events
before his accident but he did

1003
59:35
remember things.
He knew his name and he knew

1004
59:37
other things about his life.
Okay.

1005
59:40
I'll see you next week.
