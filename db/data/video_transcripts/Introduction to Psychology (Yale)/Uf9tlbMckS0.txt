Professor Paul Bloom:
This class today is about

2
0:16
language.
And language is,

3
0:18
to a large extent,
where the action is.

4
0:23
The study of human language has
been the battleground over

5
0:26
different theories of human
nature.

6
0:28
So, every philosopher or
psychologist or humanist or

7
0:32
neuroscientist who has ever
thought about people has had to

8
0:36
make some claim about the nature
of language and how it works.

9
0:40
I'm including here people like
Aristotle and Plato,

10
0:43
Hume, Locke,
Freud and Skinner.

11
0:45
I'm also including modern-day
approaches to computational

12
0:49
theory, cognitive neuroscience,
evolutionary theory and

13
0:53
cultural psychology.
If you hope to make it with a

14
0:56
theory of what people are and
how people work,

15
1:00
you have to explain and talk
about language.

16
1:03
In fact, language is
sufficiently interesting that,

17
1:06
unlike most other things I'll
talk about in this class,

18
1:10
there is an entire field
devoted to its study,

19
1:13
the field of linguistics that
is entirely devoted to studying

20
1:17
the nuances and structures of
different languages.

21
1:21
Now, I'll first,
before getting into details,

22
1:23
make a definitional point.
When I'm talking about language

23
1:27
I'm meaning systems like English
and Dutch and Warlpiri and

24
1:32
Italian and Turkish and Urdu and
what we've seen and heard right

25
1:36
now in class in the
demonstration that preceded the

26
1:40
formal lecture.
Now, you could use language in

27
1:44
a different sense.
You could use the term

28
1:47
"language" to describe what dogs
do, or what chimpanzees do,

29
1:51
or birds.
You could use language to

30
1:53
describe music,
talk about the--a musical

31
1:56
language or art,
or any communicative system,

32
1:59
and there's actually nothing
wrong with that.

33
2:02
There's no rule about how
you're supposed to use the word

34
2:05
"language."
But the problem is if you use

35
2:07
the word "language" impossibly,
incredibly broadly,

36
2:10
then from a scientific point of
view it becomes useless to ask

37
2:14
interesting questions about it.
If language can refer to just

38
2:17
about everything from English to
traffic signals,

39
2:21
then we're not going to be able
to find interesting

40
2:23
generalizations or do good
science about it.

41
2:26
So, what I want to do is,
I want to discuss the

42
2:28
scientific notion of language,
at first restricting myself to

43
2:32
systems like English and Dutch
and American sign language and

44
2:37
Navajo and so on.
Once we've made some

45
2:40
generalizations about language
in this narrow sense,

46
2:43
we could then ask,
and we will ask,

47
2:46
to what extent do other systems
such as animal communication

48
2:51
systems relate to this narrower
definition.

49
2:54
So we could ask,
in this narrow sense,

50
2:56
what properties do languages
have and then go on to ask,

51
2:59
in a broader sense,
what other communicative

52
3:01
systems also possess those
properties.

53
3:04
Well, some things are obvious
about language so here are some;

54
3:09
here are the questions we will
ask.

55
3:11
This will frame our discussion
today.

56
3:13
We'll first go over some basic
facts about language.

57
3:15
We'll talk about what languages
share, we'll talk about how

58
3:18
language develops,
and we'll talk about language

59
3:21
and communication in nonhumans.
I began this class with a

60
3:25
demonstration of--that
illustrates two very important

61
3:30
facts about language.
One is that languages all share

62
3:35
some deep and intricate
universals.

63
3:39
In particular,
all languages,

64
3:41
at minimum, are powerful enough
to convey an abstract notion

65
3:45
like this;
abstract in the sense that it

66
3:47
talks about thoughts and it
talks about a proposition and

67
3:51
spatial relations in objects.
There's no language in the

68
3:55
world that you just cannot talk
about abstract things with.

69
3:59
Every language can do this.
But the demonstration also

70
4:02
illustrated another fact about
language, which is how different

71
4:06
languages are.
They sound different.

72
4:08
If you know one language,
you don't necessarily know

73
4:11
another.
It's not merely that you can't

74
4:14
understand it.
It could sound strange or look

75
4:17
unusual in the case of a sign
language.

76
4:20
And so, any adequate theory of
language has to allow for both

77
4:25
the commonalities and the
differences across languages.

78
4:30
And this is the puzzle faced by
the psychology and cognitive

79
4:33
science of language.
Well, let's start with an

80
4:37
interesting claim about language
made by Charles Darwin.

81
4:41
So, Darwin writes,
"Man has an instinctive

82
4:43
tendency to speak,
as we see in the babble of our

83
4:47
young children,
while no child has an

84
4:50
instinctive tendency to bake,
brew or write."

85
4:53
And what Darwin is claiming
here, and it's a controversial

86
4:57
and interesting claim,
is that language is special in

87
5:00
that there's some sort of
propensity or capacity or

88
5:04
instinct for language unlike the
other examples he gives.

89
5:09
Not everything comes natural to
us but Darwin suggests that

90
5:13
language does.
Well, why should we believe

91
5:15
this?
Well, there are some basic

92
5:18
facts that support Darwin's
claim.

93
5:22
For one thing,
every normal--every human

94
5:25
society has language.
In the course of traveling,

95
5:29
cultures encounter other
cultures and they often

96
5:32
encounter cultures that are very
different from their own.

97
5:36
But through the course of human
history, nobody has ever

98
5:39
encountered another group of
humans that did not have a

99
5:42
language.
Does this show that it's built

100
5:45
in?
Well, not necessarily.

101
5:48
It could be a cultural
innovation.

102
5:51
It could be,
for instance,

103
5:52
that language is such a good
idea that every culture comes

104
5:56
across it and develops it.
Just about every culture uses

105
6:01
some sort of utensils to eat
food with, a knife and a fork,

106
6:05
chopsticks, a spoon.
This probably is not because

107
6:09
use of eating utensils is human
nature, but rather,

108
6:13
it's because it's just a very
useful thing that cultures

109
6:16
discover over and over again.
Well, we know that this

110
6:20
probably is not true with regard
to language.

111
6:23
And one reason we know this is
because of the demonstrated case

112
6:29
studies where a language is
created within a single

113
6:34
generation.
And these case studies have

114
6:38
happened over history.
The standard example is people

115
6:43
involved in the slave trade.
The slave trade revolving

116
6:48
around tobacco or cotton or
coffee or sugar would tend to

117
6:51
mix slaves and laborers from
different language backgrounds,

118
6:55
in part deliberately,
so as to avoid the possibility

119
6:59
of revolt.
What would happen is these

120
7:01
people who were enslaved from
different cultures would develop

121
7:04
a makeshift communication system
so they could talk to one

122
7:07
another.
And this is called a "pidgin,"

123
7:11
p-i-d-g-i-n, a pidgin.
And this pidgin was how they

124
7:15
would talk.
And this pidgin was not a

125
7:17
language.
It was strings of words

126
7:19
borrowed from the different
languages around them and put

127
7:22
together in sort of haphazard
ways.

128
7:25
The question is what happens to
the children who are raised in

129
7:29
this society.
And you might expect it that

130
7:32
they would come to speak a
pidgin, but they don't.

131
7:36
What happens is,
in the course of a single

132
7:39
generation, they develop their
own language.

133
7:42
They create a language with
rich syntax and morphology and

134
7:46
phonology, terms that we'll
understand in a few minutes.

135
7:50
And this language that they
create is called a "creole."

136
7:54
And languages that we know now
as creoles, the word refers back

137
7:59
to their history.
That means that they were

138
8:01
developed from pidgins.
And this is interesting because

139
8:05
this suggests that to some
extent the ability to use and

140
8:08
understand and learn language is
part of human nature.

141
8:12
It doesn't require an extensive
cultural history.

142
8:14
Rather, just about any normal
child, even when not exposed to

143
8:18
a full-fledged language,
can create a language.

144
8:21
And more recently,
there's been case studies of

145
8:25
children who acquire sign
language.

146
8:27
There's a wonderful case in
Nicaragua in sign language where

147
8:31
they acquire sign language from
adults who themselves are not

148
8:36
versed in sign language.
They're sort of second-language

149
8:39
learners struggling along.
What you might have expected

150
8:42
would be the children would then
use whatever system their adults

151
8:45
use, but they don't.
They "creolized" it.

152
8:48
They take this makeshift
communication system developed

153
8:51
by adults and,
again,

154
8:52
they turn it into a full-blown
language, suggesting that to

155
8:56
some extent it's part of our
human nature to create

156
9:00
languages.
Also, every normal human has

157
9:06
language.
Not everybody in this room can

158
9:09
ride a bicycle.
Not everybody in this room can

159
9:12
play chess.
But everybody possesses at

160
9:15
least one language.
And everybody started to

161
9:19
possess at least one language
when they were a child.

162
9:22
There are exceptions,
but the exceptions come about

163
9:26
due to some sort of brain
damage.

164
9:28
Any neurologically normal human
will come to possess a language.

165
9:33
What else do we know?
Well, the claim that language

166
9:38
is part of human nature is
supported by neurological

167
9:42
studies,
some of which were referred to

168
9:45
in the chapters on the brain
that you read earlier that talk

169
9:49
about dedicated parts of the
brain that work for language.

170
9:52
And if parts of these
brains--if parts--if these parts

171
9:56
of the brain are damaged you get
language deficits or aphasias

172
10:00
where you might lose the ability
to understand or create

173
10:04
language.
More speculatively,

174
10:06
there has been some fairly
recent work studying the genetic

175
10:11
basis of language,
looking at the genes that are

176
10:16
directly responsible for the
capacity to learn and use

177
10:20
language.
And one bit of evidence that

178
10:23
these genes are implicated is
that some unfortunate people

179
10:27
have point mutations in these
genes.

180
10:29
And such people are unable to
learn and use language.

181
10:33
So, in general,
there is some support,

182
10:35
at least at a very broad level,
for the claim that language is

183
10:39
in some sense part of human
nature.

184
10:42
Well, what do we mean by
language?

185
10:44
What are we talking about when
we talk about language?

186
10:46
We don't want to restrict
ourselves, for instance,

187
10:48
to English or French.
What do all languages share?

188
10:53
Well, all languages are
creative and this means a couple

189
11:00
of things.
One meaning is the meaning

190
11:04
emphasized by Rene Descartes.
When Rene Descartes argued that

191
11:09
we are more than merely
machines, his best piece of

192
11:12
evidence for him was the human
capacity for language.

193
11:15
No machine could do this
because our capacity for

194
11:19
language is unbounded and free.
We could say anything we choose

195
11:23
to say.
We have free will.

196
11:25
And in fact,
language allows us to produce a

197
11:29
virtual infinity of sentences.
So, we could create and

198
11:33
understand sentences that we
never heard before.

199
11:35
And there are a lot of
sentences.

200
11:38
So, if you want to estimate how
many grammatical sentences under

201
11:44
twenty words in English,
the answer is,

202
11:49
"a lot."
And what this means is that any

203
11:53
theory of language use and
language comprehension cannot

204
11:58
simply appeal to a list.
When you understand a sentence

205
12:02
I said you have to have the
capacity to understand a

206
12:05
sentence even if you've never
heard it before.

207
12:07
And this is because we could
effortlessly produce and

208
12:11
understand sentences that no
human has ever said before on

209
12:16
earth.
Would anybody volunteer to say

210
12:18
a sentence, non obscene,
non derogatory,

211
12:21
that has never been spoken
before on earth,

212
12:24
ever?

213
12:24


214
12:29
Here.
I'll start.

215
12:35
"It's surprisingly easy to get
a purple tie on eBay if you

216
12:39
don't care much about quality."
I could imagine no one else in

217
12:43
the world has said this before.
"I am upset that one cannot

218
12:47
easily download 'Buffy the
Vampire Slayer' through iTunes."

219
12:52
Now, it's possible somebody
said both these sentences

220
12:56
before, but you probably have
not heard them.

221
13:00
But you understand them
immediately.

222
13:03
So, how do you do it?
Well, you have rules in your

223
13:08
head.
You've learnt what the words

224
13:11
mean, but you have abstract and
unconscious rules that take

225
13:15
these words,
figure out the order,

226
13:18
and in a fraction of a second,
give rise to understanding.

227
13:22
And that's the sort of thing
linguists study.

228
13:24
So, take some standard examples
from the linguistic study of

229
13:30
English.
And bear in mind the rules

230
13:32
we're talking about here are not
rules you explicitly know.

231
13:36
They're automatic rules of the
same sort we're going to talk

232
13:40
about in the context of visual
perception in that they're

233
13:44
implicit and unconscious and not
accessible to explicit

234
13:47
understanding.
So for instance,

235
13:50
immediately you read "The pig
is eager to eat" versus "The pig

236
13:55
is easy to eat" and in a
fraction of a second you know

237
13:59
there's an important difference.
"The pig is eager to eat" means

238
14:04
the state of affairs that we're
talking about is when the pig

239
14:07
does the eating.
"The pig is easy to eat" is

240
14:10
when the pig is being eaten.
You would see a sentence like

241
14:14
"Bill knew that John liked him"
and you know,

242
14:17
without even knowing how you
know,

243
14:19
that this could mean that Bill
knew that John liked Bill or it

244
14:24
could mean that Bill knew that
John liked Fred.

245
14:28
But it can't mean that Bill
knew that John liked John.

246
14:32
The natural interpretation,
in fact, is that Bill knew that

247
14:35
John liked Bill.
The two words co-refer.

248
14:39
Contrast that with "Bill knew
that John liked himself," which

249
14:42
only has the meaning Bill knew
that John liked John.

250
14:46
And this is what linguists do
for a living so if you hear me

251
14:49
talking about this and say,
"I want to spend the next forty

252
14:52
years of my life studying that,"
you should become a linguist.

253
14:56
But that's the sort of--those
are the sort of phenomena that

254
14:59
we're interested in.
Now, it gets more complicated.

255
15:02
Those are examples from syntax,
but language has many

256
15:05
structures.
Language has structures going

257
15:08
from the bottom to the top.
All languages--All human

258
15:12
languages have phonology,
which is the system of sounds

259
15:17
or signs;
morphology, which is the system

260
15:21
of words or morphemes,
basic units of meaning;

261
15:26
and syntax, which refer to
rules and principles that put

262
15:30
together words and phrases into
meaningful utterances.

263
15:34
And I want to talk briefly
about each of these three parts

264
15:38
of language before looking at
some other issues.

265
15:42
I'm indebted here to Steven
Pinker's excellent book The

266
15:45
Language Instinct which
provides, I think,

267
15:47
a superb discussion of these
phenomena.

268
15:49
And I'm going to steal some of
my examples from Pinker.

269
15:53
So, phonology.
Phonology is the system of

270
15:59
sounds that languages have.

271
16:01


272
16:08
There's a subset.
There's a list,

273
16:11
a finite list,
of possible sounds that

274
16:13
language can use.
I'm going to put aside for the

275
16:15
moment the question of sign
languages and how they work.

276
16:18
I'm going to talk about them in
a little bit.

277
16:20
The idea is that English has
about forty of these phonemes.

278
16:25
So, if you're a native
monolingual speaker of English

279
16:29
you hear speech and each sound
you hear is categorized as

280
16:33
falling into one of those forty
morphemes--sorry,

281
16:37
phonemes.
So, for example,

282
16:39
English has a phoneme of "lu,"
"l," and a phoneme of "r."

283
16:46
And so, an English speaker can
hear the difference between

284
16:50
"lip" and "rip" and that
corresponds to two different

285
16:53
words in English.
Other languages don't have that

286
16:57
distinction and so those
distinctions are very difficult

287
17:01
for non-native English speakers
to learn.

288
17:04
So, part of what goes on when
you learn, is you have to learn

289
17:09
the language--the phonemes that
your language has.

290
17:12
Another part of the problem of
learning language is you have to

291
17:17
figure out what the boundaries
are between the words.

292
17:20
You have to use sound signals
to figure out the boundaries

293
17:23
between the words.
Now that--If the only language

294
17:26
you've ever heard is English,
that's going to seem like a

295
17:29
really weird example of a
problem because you're listening

296
17:33
to me speak and in between each
of my words you're hearing a

297
17:36
pause.
You don't have to be very smart

298
17:38
to figure out where one word
begins and one word ends.

299
17:41
But the pause is a
psychological illusion.

300
17:45
If you were to just talk into
an oscilloscope that measured

301
17:49
your sound vibrations,
there are no pauses between the

302
17:52
words.
Rather, the pauses are inserted

303
17:55
by your mind as you already know
where one word begins and

304
17:59
another one ends.
And you insert a pause at that

305
18:03
point.
You could see this when you

306
18:05
hear a language you don't
already know.

307
18:09
So, for those of you who have
never heard French before,

308
18:12
when you hear somebody say,
"Je ne sais pas" you could say,

309
18:15
"Remarkable!
French has no pauses between

310
18:18
words."
And you-- And now a French

311
18:21
speaker, of course,
hears "Je ne sais pas."

312
18:24
For Hebrew, I know one sentence
in Hebrew: "Sleecha,

313
18:28
eypho ha-sheeruteem" which I
think is a request for the

314
18:31
bathroom.
But if you don't know Hebrew

315
18:35
there's no pauses.
And the truth is,

316
18:37
when you each gave your
demonstrations,

317
18:40
nobody spoke properly because
nobody spoke--Here's the

318
18:44
sentence: "Glorp fendel smug
wuggle."

319
18:47
Rather, you all sounded like,
"blublublublublub" without any

320
18:51
pauses because I don't know your
languages.

321
18:54
Children come into the world
without knowing any specific

322
18:59
language and so they have to
learn pauses.

323
19:03
They have to learn to interpret
sounds in context and sometimes

324
19:08
they make mistakes.
They get problems of

325
19:11
segmentation.
And there are some

326
19:13
illustrations.
You could see their mistakes if

327
19:16
they're trying to repeat back
something that's already known

328
19:19
within a society.
So, songs are a good example.

329
19:22
These are excerpts from
children.

330
19:24
"I'll never be your pizza
burnin'."

331
19:27
Anybody know--figure out what
that corresponds to?

332
19:29
Student: Beast of burden?
Professor Paul Bloom:

333
19:31
"Beast of burden."
Very good.

334
19:33
"A girl with colitis goes by."
Somebody?

335
19:38
Student: "A girl with
kaleidoscope eyes."

336
19:41
Professor Paul Bloom:
"The ants are my friends;

337
19:42
they're blowin' in the wind."
And [laughter]

338
19:48
this is a religious one.
"Our father with Bart in heaven;

339
19:54
Harold be they name… Lead us
not into Penn Station…" Now,

340
19:59
phonological understanding
illustrates all sorts of aspects

341
20:04
of language processing and,
in fact, of consciousness.

342
20:08
Because remember I said that,
typically, when you hear a

343
20:13
sentence you make--you
manufacture in your mind gaps

344
20:17
between the words.
Typically, when there's

345
20:21
something which is unclear
you'll fill in the gap and

346
20:25
figure out what the word is.
And you'll hear it that way.

347
20:29
So, the few examples--The best
examples, again,

348
20:32
are for when it goes wrong.
So, a classic example is from

349
20:37
the song "Super Freak" by Rick
James.

350
20:41
I got a big lecture about
copyright laws and this is going

351
20:46
to violate most of them.
Rick James is going to be

352
20:49
sitting on the--at--staring at
the web two years from now

353
20:51
saying, "Hey.
That's my thing."

354
20:53
Okay.
So, I want you to listen to

355
20:55
this line.
I'm sure most of you have heard

356
20:59
this before but I want you to
listen closely.

357
21:04
What was that last line?

358
21:06


359
21:15
[laughter]
"The kind of girl you read

360
21:17
about--" Well,
it turns out that nobody really

361
21:20
knows.
And it sounds to many people

362
21:23
who do top-down interpretation
as--to me as well,

363
21:28
that "she's the kind of girl
you read about in

364
21:30
Newsweek magazine."
But that makes no sense at all

365
21:34
given that you don't want to
"bring home to Mama."

366
21:39
And she's--and it's not
the--and in fact,

367
21:42
if you check the notes on the
song, she's in fact,

368
21:46
"the kind of girl you read
about in new wave magazines."

369
21:50
Now, when you listen to it
then, again, knowing that,

370
21:57
you hear it that way.
Now, this top-down--This is

371
22:02
known as "top-down" processing.
Top-down processing is an

372
22:06
example of when you know what
something is you hear it that

373
22:12
way.
And this is extremely useful

374
22:16
when it comes to filling in gaps
in sounds.

375
22:21
In normal conversation,
if I'm to say "s-- entence" you

376
22:26
won't hear that as "s--
entence."

377
22:29
Rather, you hear "sentence."
You fill in the gap.

378
22:32
This can lead to problems.
The problem it's led to in my

379
22:36
life revolves around the song
"Get Crunk" [laughter]

380
22:41
because I've heard "Get Crunk"
and my children asked me if I

381
22:45
would buy them "Get Crunk" from
iTunes.

382
22:49
My children are eight and ten.
And now "Get Crunk," as I was

383
22:53
aware from having heard it
before, involves the consistent

384
22:57
refrain of "get crunk" extremely
bad word,

385
23:00
"get crunk" extremely bad word,
and so I said "no."

386
23:04
And then they said,
"Well, there's a clean version

387
23:06
of it."
So, I downloaded the clean

388
23:09
version.
Unfortunately,

389
23:10
knowing what the clean
version--knowing what the word

390
23:14
is means to me the clean version
is not very clean.

391
23:18
Now, I will add,
[laughter]

392
23:21
before people write letters and
stuff, this is the clean

393
23:28
version.
[laughter]

394
23:31
Thank goodness they took away
that obscene word.

395
23:37
[laughter] Okay.
So, top-down processing affects

396
23:42
how we hear things,
usually, almost always,

397
23:45
for the better.
And in fact,

398
23:47
this is a theme we're going to
return to next class when we

399
23:50
talk about vision because the
same thing is going to happen

400
23:54
there.
How we see the world is often

401
23:57
confusing and befuddled but what
we know can clear things up.

402
24:03
Same with sound.

403
24:04


404
24:08
Morphology is the next level up.
Phonology is sounds.

405
24:11
Morphology is words.
And human language uses this

406
24:16
amazing trick described by
Ferdinand de Saussure,

407
24:19
the great linguist,
as "the arbitrariness of the

408
24:23
sign."
And what this means is we can

409
24:26
use--take any arbitrary idea in
the world, the idea of a chair

410
24:31
or a story or a country,
and make a sound or a sign to

411
24:36
connect to it.
And the link is arbitrary.

412
24:40
You might choose to use a word
for "dog" as "woof woof" because

413
24:44
it sounds like a dog but you
can't use a word for "country"

414
24:49
that sounds like a country.
You could use a sign language

415
24:53
thing for "drink" that looks
sort of like the act of drinking

416
24:56
but you can't use a sign
language word for "country" that

417
25:00
looks like a country,
or for "idea" that looks like

418
25:03
an idea.
So, the way languages work is

419
25:06
it allows for arbitrary naming.
It allows for this map between

420
25:11
a symbol, say a spoken word,
and any sort of thought we want

421
25:17
to use.
And those arbitrary mappings,

422
25:20
as we come to learn them,
make up the vocabulary of a

423
25:25
language.
I'm talking about words but the

424
25:28
more technical term is
"morpheme."

425
25:31
And what a morpheme is is the
smallest meaningful unit in a

426
25:35
language.
Now often, this is the same

427
25:38
thing as a word.
So, "dog" is a word.

428
25:40
And "dog" is also a morpheme,
but not always because there

429
25:43
are single morphemes and then
there are words that are

430
25:46
composed of many morphemes.
So, "dogs" and "complained" are

431
25:51
one word, but two morphemes and
what this means is that you make

432
25:57
the word by putting together two
morphemes.

433
26:01
To put it differently,
in order to know what "dogs"

434
26:04
means, you never had to learn
the word "dogs."

435
26:07
All you had to know is the word
"dog" and the plural morpheme

436
26:11
's' and you could put them
together to create a word.

437
26:15
How many morphemes does the
average speaker know?

438
26:20
The answer is fairly startling.
The average speaker knows,

439
26:25
as a low-ball estimate,
about 60,000 words.

440
26:28
I think the proper estimate is
closer to 80,000 or 100,000.

441
26:34
What this means,
if you average it out,

442
26:37
is that since children start
learning their first words at

443
26:40
about their first year of life,
they learn about nine new words

444
26:44
a day.
And it's not a continuous nine

445
26:49
words every day.
It goes up and down depending

446
26:54
on the age.
But still, the amount of words

447
26:56
we know is staggering.
How many of you know more than

448
27:00
one language pretty fluently?
Those of you who know other

449
27:04
languages might have in your
heads 200,000 words or 300,000

450
27:08
words and you're accessing them
in a fraction of a second.

451
27:12
It is--could legitimately be
seen as one of the most

452
27:18
astonishing things that people
do.

453
27:22
Finally, syntax.
So, we have the sound system of

454
27:26
a language, the phonology.
We have the words of a

455
27:29
language, the morphology,
but all that gives you is

456
27:33
"dog," "cup," "chair," "house,"
"story," "idea."

457
27:37
That won't allow us to
communicate complicated ideas.

458
27:41
So, the final step in the story
is syntax.

459
27:45
And syntax refers to those
rules and principles that allow

460
27:49
us to combine words into phrases
and phrases into sentences.

461
27:54
And syntax uses another neat
trick and this is defined by

462
27:59
Wilhelm von Humboldt as the
"infinite use of finite media."

463
28:05
So, here's the question.
Your vocabulary is finite.

464
28:09
There are just so many words.
You have to learn them one by

465
28:12
one, but you could produce a
virtual infinity of sentences.

466
28:16
How can you do that?
How can you go from a finite

467
28:20
list of symbols to an infinite
number of sentences?

468
28:25
And the answer is you have a
combinatorial system.

469
28:30
Now, language is not the only
thing in culture or nature that

470
28:34
has this sort of combinatorial
system.

471
28:37
Music also has a combinatorial
system.

472
28:40
There's a finite number of
notes but a limitless number of

473
28:43
musical compositions.
DNA also has this sort of

474
28:47
combinatorial system where you
have a finite number of,

475
28:53
I guess, bases or amino acids
that could combine to a possible

476
28:57
infinity of strings,
of DNA strings.

477
29:00


478
29:03
So, how does this happen?
Well, the infinity mechanism,

479
29:08
and many of you will be
familiar with this from

480
29:11
mathematics or computer science,
is recursion.

481
29:14
And there's a lot to be said
about this but it could be

482
29:17
pretty simply illustrated in
language.

483
29:20
So, here's an example of a
simple language.

484
29:22
It's not--It's actually close
to how linguists describe normal

485
29:27
languages, but it's very simple.
It has three nouns,

486
29:31
"Fred," "Barney" and "Wilma,"
and two verbs,

487
29:34
"thinks" and "likes."
A very simple language.

488
29:38
And one rule.
And the way to read this rule

489
29:42
is you make a sentence by taking
a noun, any noun,

490
29:47
putting a verb after it,
and then following that verb

491
29:51
with a noun.
Now, when you do this,

492
29:54
how many--And then so,
for instance,

493
29:57
you get the sentence "Fred
likes Wilma."

494
30:01
When you do this,
how many possible sentences are

495
30:04
there?
Let me just take a second.

496
30:06
Okay.
Any guesses?

497
30:12
Eighteen.
The sentences are "Fred likes

498
30:16
Fred," "Fred likes Barney,"
"Fred likes Wilma,"

499
30:19
"Fred thinks Fred," "Fred
thinks Barney," "Fred thinks

500
30:21
Wilma," and so on.
The three nouns followed by any

501
30:25
of the two verbs followed by any
of the three nouns.

502
30:28
That is not a very interesting
language.

503
30:30
But now, take a more
complicated language--same

504
30:34
vocabulary, the same three
nouns, the same two verbs,

505
30:39
the same sentence,
but now one other sentence.

506
30:43
This sentence expands to a noun
followed by a verb followed by a

507
30:48
sentence and there you get
recursion.

508
30:51
You have one rule invoking
another rule and then you can

509
30:57
get a sentence like "Fred thinks
Barney likes Wilma."

510
31:04
And here you get a potential
infinity of sentences.

511
31:09
And this is obviously a toy
example but you could see the

512
31:14
use of recursion in everyday
life and in everyday use of

513
31:19
language.
You could say,

514
31:21
"John hates cheese," "My
roommate heard a rumor that John

515
31:24
hates cheese,"
"It disturbed Mary when I told

516
31:26
her that my roommate heard a
rumor that John hates cheese,"

517
31:29
"I was amazed that it disturbed
Mary when I told her that my

518
31:31
roommate heard a rumor that John
hates cheese,"

519
31:33
"Professor Bloom had devoted
way too much of his lecture

520
31:34
talking about how I was amazed
[laughter]

521
31:36
that it disturbed Mary when I
told her that my roommate heard

522
31:38
a rumor that John hates cheese,"
"It really bothered me that--"

523
31:42
and there's no limit.
There's no longest sentence.

524
31:46
You could keep producing a
sentence deeper and deeper

525
31:49
embedded until you die.
And this is part of the power

526
31:52
of language.
Now, the syntactic rules are

527
31:56
complicated.
And one of the puzzles of

528
31:59
syntactic rules,
or one of the issues of them,

529
32:02
is that different rules can
conspire to create the same

530
32:06
sentence.
So, you take a sentence

531
32:08
like--This is a classic line
from Groucho Marx:

532
32:12
"I once shot an elephant in my
pajamas.

533
32:15
How it got into my pajamas I'll
never know."

534
32:17
And the humor,
such that it is,

535
32:20
revolves around the ambiguity
of rules that generate it,

536
32:24
like this versus like this.
Often, to illustrate the issues

537
32:29
of ambiguity,
people have collected poorly

538
32:33
thought-out headlines in
newspaper reports that play

539
32:38
on--that inadvertently have
ambiguity.

540
32:42
"Complaints about NBA referees
growing ugly."

541
32:45
So, that's the beauty of that
structure.

542
32:48
"Kids make nutritious snacks."
"No one was injured in a blast

543
32:54
which was attributed to the
buildup of gas by one town

544
32:58
official."
Last summer I was in Seoul

545
33:01
visiting the--visiting Korea
University and the big headline

546
33:07
there on the front page was
"General arrested for fondling

547
33:13
privates."
[laughter]

548
33:15
Now, there actually is--The
ambiguity is actually quite

549
33:20
difficult to avoid in the
construction and understanding

550
33:24
of sentences.
It's one of the ways in which

551
33:28
it's often difficult to write
clearly, and in fact,

552
33:31
there's a whole sub-field of
the law involving the use of

553
33:36
linguistic theory to
disambiguate sentences both in

554
33:40
the Constitution,
in legislation,

555
33:44
as well as in some criminal
cases.

556
33:48
And there was,
several years ago,

557
33:51
a very serious criminal case
that rested on a sentence.

558
33:57
And here's what happened.
There were two brothers,

559
34:00
one of them retarded,
and they get into a robbery.

560
34:03
And a police officer sees them
and points the gun at them.

561
34:09
And one of the brothers points
a gun at the police officer.

562
34:15
The police officer shouts for
the brother, the non-retarded

563
34:19
brother, to drop the gun.
Actually, he said,

564
34:23
"Give me the gun."
The retarded brother shouted,

565
34:27
"Let him have it," whereupon
the brother shot and killed the

566
34:32
police officer.
Now, the brother who did the

567
34:35
shooting was plainly a murderer.
What about that brother who

568
34:39
shouted, "Let him have it"?
Well, it depends on what he--on

569
34:43
how you interpret that sentence
because the sentence is

570
34:47
beautifully ambiguous.
It could mean "shoot him,

571
34:52
let him have it," or it could
mean "give him the gun,

572
34:56
let him have it."
And in fact,

573
34:59
the trial, which I think
somebody could--If people out

574
35:01
there know about this,
please send me an e-mail.

575
35:04
My understanding was he was
found guilty but a lot to turn

576
35:08
on the ambiguity of a sentence.
I want to shift now and talk

577
35:13
about where does all this
knowledge come from but I'll

578
35:17
stop and answer any questions
about the material so far.

579
35:22
What are your questions?
Yes.

580
35:24
Student: How does syntax
differ from grammar or are they

581
35:27
exactly the same?
Professor Paul Bloom:

582
35:29
Syntax--The question is,
"How is syntax different from

583
35:30
grammar?"
They're exactly the same.

584
35:33
Syntax is a more technical term
but it means the same thing as

585
35:39
grammar.
Yes.

586
35:41
Student: You said that
every normal human being that's

587
35:44
born uses at some point or
another some kind of language.

588
35:47
Aren't there people who weren't
born within a culture and grew

589
35:52
up and who never really spoke a
language though they were

590
35:57
physically normal?
Professor Paul Bloom:

591
35:59
Yes.
I'm glad you actually asked me

592
36:01
about that because,
as I said it,

593
36:02
I realized it wasn't quite
right.

594
36:04
The point that was just raised
here is I had said before that

595
36:07
everybody who's neurologically
normal comes to acquire and

596
36:11
learn a language.
But what about people who are

597
36:14
neurologically normal but they
don't have language around them?

598
36:18
And in fact,
there have been,

599
36:20
historically,
some cases of this.

600
36:22
There's been,
probably apocryphal,

601
36:24
stories about children who are
raised by wolves or by dogs.

602
36:29
There are stories,
horrible stories,

603
36:31
some in the twentieth century,
about children who are locked

604
36:35
away by insane or evil parents
and have never learned to speak.

605
36:40
There are stories of deaf
people who are within certain

606
36:43
societies where nobody signs to
them, and so they're what's

607
36:47
known as linguistic isolates.
And they themselves never learn

608
36:50
to speak.
And those cases are the

609
36:53
dramatic exception and they do
tell you something.

610
36:57
They tell you that it's not
enough to have a brain for

611
36:59
language.
Somebody does have to use it

612
37:02
with you.
Interestingly,

613
37:04
it doesn't have to be that many
people.

614
37:07
So, Susan Goldin-Meadow has
studied deaf children that

615
37:11
nobody signed to but what she
studies is deaf children with

616
37:15
deaf siblings and these children
don't just sit there.

617
37:19
They create their own language.
It's not a full-blown language

618
37:23
like American sign-language or
langue des signes

619
37:25
quebecoise but it's a
language nonetheless,

620
37:28
with words and syntax and
phonology.

621
37:31
It's an interesting question.
Any other questions?

622
37:39
Yes.
Student: Could it be

623
37:46
argued that there are inherent
limits to grammar?

624
37:56
Professor Paul Bloom:
It's a good question.

625
37:58
The question is,
"Are there inherent limits in

626
38:00
our abilities to come up with
grammars?"

627
38:03
And most linguists would argue
"yes," that languages are highly

628
38:07
constrained in how they do
things.

629
38:09
So, for instance,
one example is there's no

630
38:12
language in the world that ever
constructs a question by

631
38:17
switching the order of words
around in a sentence.

632
38:21
There's no language in the
world that has a rule that says

633
38:25
the fifth word has to be a verb.
And linguists have all of these

634
38:29
conditions they say,
"no language in the world works

635
38:31
this way."
Now this is--;So,

636
38:33
these are constraints on
grammar and they're really

637
38:36
interesting because they tell us
what's a humanly natural

638
38:39
language versus what's not a
humanly natural language.

639
38:43
But notice, even if there is
incredible constraints on

640
38:46
grammars, still--we could still
produce an infinite number of

641
38:50
sentences.
It's just like if you restrict

642
38:53
me to only a subset of numbers,
only the odd numbers,

643
38:57
still there's an infinity of
odd numbers.

644
39:00
So, grammar can be restricted
but still give rise to an

645
39:07
infinity of possible sentences.
Well, there's a radical claim

646
39:13
about the origin of language
associated with the guy who we

647
39:17
met when we talked about
behaviorism who wrote A

648
39:20
Review of Verbal Behavior,
 the linguist Noam Chomsky.

649
39:24
And Chomsky makes this radical
claim.

650
39:28
And this is that we shouldn't
view language learning as

651
39:31
learning at all.
Instead, we should view it as

652
39:34
something similar to growth.
So he says,

653
39:37
No one would take
seriously the proposal that a

654
39:39
human organism learns through
experience to have arms rather

655
39:42
than wings,
or that the basic structure of

656
39:45
particular organs results from
accidental experience.

657
39:47
[Language]
proves to be no less marvelous

658
39:49
and intricate than these
physical structures.

659
39:51
Why, then, should we not study
the acquisition of a cognitive

660
39:55
structure like language more or
less as we study some complex

661
39:58
bodily organ?
So, you might learn to play

662
40:01
baseball, you might learn about
the American Civil War,

663
40:05
but if Chomsky is right you
didn't learn to speak English.

664
40:09
Rather, what happened is you
heard English and--but the

665
40:12
capacity grew in your head and
something a lot more similar to

666
40:17
the development of arms or legs
or a visual system.

667
40:20
Well, should we believe this?
We know there has to be some

668
40:25
effect of the environment
shaping language,

669
40:28
obviously,
because in order to know

670
40:31
English you have to have heard
English, in order to know Dutch

671
40:34
you have had to heard,
to--had to have learned and

672
40:37
heard Dutch.
And in fact,

673
40:39
languages differ in all the
ways that we were talking about.

674
40:42
Some languages like English has
a--have a distinction between

675
40:46
‘l' and ‘r.'
Other languages do not.

676
40:49
For a language like English,
that creature there is referred

677
40:53
to with the morpheme "dog."
That's a historical accident of

678
40:57
English.
In French it's chien and

679
41:01
in Greek it's something else.
And each of those 6,000

680
41:06
languages and people in the room
who know another language would

681
41:09
say,
"Yeah, in Vietnamese it's

682
41:11
this," "In Urdu it's this," "In
Czech it's that."

683
41:14
Finally, there is syntax.
So, English is what's known as

684
41:19
a subject-verb-object language.
That means if you want to

685
41:24
convey the idea that Bill hit
John, you would say,

686
41:28
"Bill hit John."
But not all languages work that

687
41:32
way.
In fact, the majority of

688
41:34
languages, more languages,
are actually

689
41:36
subject-object-verb languages.
So, you would say,

690
41:40
if you wanted to convey that
Bill was the hitter and John was

691
41:44
hit, "Bill John hit."
All of this has to be learned.

692
41:48
And all of this has to be
learned through exposure to

693
41:51
language users.
On the other hand,

694
41:54
there is considerable evidence
that the development of these

695
41:59
language skills,
in some way,

696
42:02
is similar to growth in the way
that Chomsky suggests.

697
42:09
So, here are some basic facts
about language development.

698
42:12
One is something which I had
mentioned before.

699
42:15
All normal children learn
language.

700
42:21
There can be specific
impairments of language.

701
42:25
Now, again, we spoke about them
before when talking about the

702
42:28
brain.
Some of these impairments could

703
42:30
be due to trauma,
the aphasias.

704
42:33
Trauma, a blow to the head,
a stroke can rid you of your

705
42:38
language.
But, also, there are genetic

706
42:40
disorders, some falling under
the rubric of what's known as

707
42:44
"specific language impairment,"
where children are born without

708
42:49
the same ability as the rest of
us to learn to speak.

709
42:55
And these are interesting in
many ways.

710
42:58
One reason that they're
interesting is that they

711
43:01
illustrate something about human
language.

712
43:04
It is not--It would not be
unreasonable for you to think

713
43:08
before listening to his lecture,
"Look.

714
43:10
All you need to have to learn a
language is to be smart" or "All

715
43:14
you need to have to learn a
language is to want to

716
43:18
communicate" or "All you need to
have to learn a language is to

717
43:22
be a social person wanting
to--having the ability to

718
43:25
understand others and deal with
others."

719
43:28
But the cases of specific
language impairments suggest

720
43:32
that all of that is wrong,
because there are children in

721
43:36
this world right now who are
plenty smart,

722
43:39
who really want to communicate,
and who are entirely social

723
43:44
creatures but they can't learn
language.

724
43:48
And this suggests that the
ability to learn language and

725
43:52
understand language is to some
extent separate from these other

726
43:56
aspects of mental life.
Continuing on this theme,

727
44:00
we also know that language is
learnt without any sort of

728
44:05
feedback or training.
There are many Americans who

729
44:08
believe that they need to teach
their children language.

730
44:12
And there's a huge industry
with DVDs and flash cards and

731
44:16
all sorts of things designed to
teach your children language.

732
44:19
And I think many parents
believe that if they didn't

733
44:22
persist in using these things
their children would never learn

734
44:25
to speak.
But we know that that's not

735
44:28
true.
We know that this isn't true

736
44:30
because there are communities
where they don't speak to their

737
44:35
kids.
They don't speak to their kids

738
44:37
because they don't believe it's
important to speak to their

739
44:40
kids.
Some linguists would

740
44:42
interview--Linguists would
interview adults in these

741
44:45
communities and say,
"Why don't you speak to your

742
44:48
babies?"
And these adults would respond,

743
44:51
"It'd be ridiculous to speak to
a baby.

744
44:54
The baby has nothing to say.
You might as well just speak to

745
44:58
your dog."
And then the American linguist

746
45:00
would say, "Yeah.
We speak to our dogs."

747
45:05
[laughter]
Americans and Europeans speak

748
45:07
to everything and everybody.
Other cultures are more picky

749
45:10
and they don't talk to their
children until their children

750
45:14
themselves are talking.
This doesn't seem to make much

751
45:17
of a difference in language
learning.

752
45:20
Some studies have,
motivated by Chomsky's work in

753
45:24
expressed--sorry,
motivated by Chomsky's critique

754
45:28
of Skinner's Verbal Behavior,
 have asked even in-- "What

755
45:33
if we just looked at children
within the United States?

756
45:36
Don't these children get
feedback?"

757
45:39
And the answer is yes and no.
So your average highly educated

758
45:45
Western parent does give their
children feedback--do give their

759
45:50
children feedback based on what
they say.

760
45:53
But they don't typically give
feedback based on the syntax or

761
45:58
grammaticality of what they say.
The example given by Brown and

762
46:03
Hanlon in the classic study in
the 1970s is they did all of

763
46:07
these studies looking at what
children say and how parents

764
46:10
responded,
and it turns out parents

765
46:13
respond not to the grammatical
correctness but to the affect or

766
46:19
cuteness or sociability of the
utterance.

767
46:23
So for instance,
if a child says to his mother,

768
46:26
"I loves you,
Mommy," it's a very unusual

769
46:28
parent who would say,
"Oh, no.

770
46:30
The verb agreement is mistaken.
[laughter]

771
46:34
You've added a redundant ‘s.'
It's not appropriate."

772
46:38
Similarly, if a child is to
say, "I hate your guts,

773
46:42
Mother," it's an unusual
mother, "That's wonderful.

774
46:45
There's a subject, verb, object.
The whole thing's structurally

775
46:48
fine."
We respond to our kids like we

776
46:51
respond to each other based on
the message that's conveyed,

777
46:54
not the grammaticality of the
utterances.

778
46:56
Children make grammatical
mistakes all the time but then

779
47:00
they go away and they go away
without correction.

780
47:04
So those are some basic facts.
What do we know about the time

781
47:09
course of language?
Well, early on children start

782
47:13
off and they prefer the melody
of their own language.

783
47:18
These studies were done in
France with four-day-old babies.

784
47:23
And what they did was they used
a sucking method.

785
47:26
Remember, there's a limited
number of things babies can do.

786
47:28
One of the things they can do
is suck, and these babies would

787
47:32
suck on a pacifier to hear
French.

788
47:34
And they would prefer to hear
French than to hear Russian.

789
47:41
And these investigators claimed
this is because they had been

790
47:45
exposed to French in the first
four days of their lives.

791
47:49
Reviewers, mostly from France,
objected and said,

792
47:53
"No.
Maybe French just sounds better.

793
47:55
Everybody's going to like
French."

794
47:57
So, they re-did the study in
Russia.

795
48:00
Russian kids sucked harder to
hear Russian than they did to

796
48:03
French.
And what they're listening to

797
48:06
isn't the words.
They don't know words yet.

798
48:08
They don't know of syntax yet.
It's the rhythm of the language.

799
48:11
For you, French and Russian
sound different.

800
48:14
Even if you're like me and you
don't know a word of either

801
48:17
language, they still sound
different.

802
48:18
They sound different to babies
too.

803
48:22
And a baby being raised in
France or a baby being raised in

804
48:27
Russia knows enough to tell
what's his language and what

805
48:32
isn't.
Early on, children are

806
48:35
sensitive to every phoneme there
is.

807
48:40
So, English-speaking children,
for instance,

808
48:42
can--English-speaking babies
– babies who are born in the

809
48:46
United States – can
distinguish between English

810
48:49
phonemes like "lip" and "rip"
but they could also distinguish

811
48:53
between phonemic contrasts that
are not exemplified in English,

812
48:58
such as phonemic contrasts in
Czech or Hindi.

813
49:00
Yes.
Student:

814
49:02
I'm wondering if you can say
the wrong things to them--to

815
49:06
infants based on what you were
saying before.

816
49:09
Because I was in France one
summer and I had some neighbors

817
49:11
there.
I hated these neighbors,

818
49:13
I thought they were stupid.
Not because they were French,

819
49:18
but they had a baby and it
would gaggle and coo and they

820
49:25
would respond in similar terms.
Professor Paul Bloom:

821
49:30
They would gaggle and coo back
at the baby.

822
49:31
Student: [inaudible]
And I hate these people.

823
49:34
[inaudible]
So I don't know if it--Does it

824
49:40
matter what you say to babies as
long as you say something.

825
49:50
Professor Paul Bloom:
There's a lot going on in your

826
49:54
question.
[laughter]

827
49:55
Some raising--Well,
there's a lot going on in your

828
49:57
question.
The answer to the question--

829
50:00
The question was,
"your baby's going to coo and

830
50:03
'ga ga, goo goo,' does it matter
if you coo and 'ga ga,

831
50:06
goo goo' back?"
No, it doesn't make a

832
50:08
difference.
Your hatred towards them was

833
50:11
unmotivated.
You can be relieved of that

834
50:15
debt, or now you know you feel
bad now, I guess.

835
50:18
[laughter]
If you speak to your children

836
50:22
in perfect English,
it's very strange.

837
50:25
Nobody speaks to their babies
in, "Hello, Son.

838
50:28
It's time--Oh.
You want to change your diaper

839
50:31
right now so stay still."
That's bad parenting.

840
50:34
It sounds kind of silly.
More--What most people do is,

841
50:36
"Oh.
You're such a cute little baby."

842
50:38
And it probably--One--T
here's--Evolutionary

843
50:41
psychologists debate the
function of why we talk funny to

844
50:46
babies.
And some people have argued

845
50:48
that it does help their language
learning.

846
50:51
And some people have argued
instead that what it does is it

847
50:55
calms them.
They like to hear the music of

848
50:57
a smooth voice and so on.
But whether or not you do so

849
51:01
doesn't seem to make a big
difference.

850
51:03
It is very difficult to find
any effect of how parents talk

851
51:07
to their kids on how their kids
learn language,

852
51:10
particularly when it comes to
babies.

853
51:13
So, early on babies can--are
sensitive to all phonemes and

854
51:19
then that goes away.
Around twelve months of age it

855
51:23
goes away.
This is one thing you were much

856
51:26
better at when you were a baby
than you are now.

857
51:29
When you were a baby you were a
multilingual fool.

858
51:33
You could understand the sound
differences of every language on

859
51:38
earth.
Now, if you're like me,

860
51:41
you could barely understand
English.

861
51:43
[laughter]
You narrow down until you're

862
51:46
sensitive just to the language
you hear.

863
51:49
And this narrowing down is
largely in place by about twelve

864
51:55
months of age.
Around seven months is babbling.

865
51:59
And I want to stop at this
point to go back to the issue--I

866
52:04
promised you I would turn a bit
to sign language and I want to

867
52:09
describe now a very elegant--I
want to show a little film now

868
52:14
of a very elegant series of
experiments looking at the

869
52:18
question of whether babies who
are exposed to a sign language,

870
52:23
babble.
One of the real surprising

871
52:26
findings in my field over the
last ten/twenty years has been

872
52:31
that the acquisition of sign
languages has turned out to be

873
52:36
almost exactly the same;
in fact, as far as we know,

874
52:40
exactly the same as the
acquisition of spoken languages.

875
52:43
It didn't have to be that way.
It could have been just as

876
52:46
reasonable to expect that
there'd be an advantage for

877
52:50
speech over sign.
That sign languages may be

878
52:53
full-blown languages but they
just take--they're just harder

879
52:56
to learn because the brain and
the body have adapted for

880
53:00
speech.
It turns out that this just

881
53:02
isn't the case.
It turns out that sign and--the

882
53:05
developmental milestones of sign
languages and the developmental

883
53:09
milestones of spoken languages
are precisely the same.

884
53:12
They start babbling at the same
point.

885
53:14
They start using first words,
first sentences,

886
53:17
first complicated
constructions.

887
53:19
There seems to be no
interesting difference between

888
53:23
how the brain comes to acquire
and use the spoken language

889
53:27
versus a sign language.
Around twelve months of age,

890
53:31
children start using their
first words.

891
53:35
These are words for objects and
actions like "dog" and "up" and

892
53:41
"milk."
They start showing some

893
53:44
sensitivity to the order of
words.

894
53:47
So they know that "dog bites
cat" is different from "cat

895
53:53
bites dog."
Around eighteen months of age,

896
53:56
they start learning words
faster.

897
53:58
They start producing little,
miniature sentences like "Want

898
54:02
cookie" or "Milk spill" and the
function morphemes,

899
54:07
the little words,
"in," "of," "a," "the," and so

900
54:10
on start to gradually appear.

901
54:12


902
54:15
Then the--Then there's the bad
news.

903
54:17
Around seven years of age going
up through puberty,

904
54:22
the ability to learn language
starts to go away.

905
54:26
The best work on this has been
done by Elissa Newport and Sam

906
54:31
Supalla who have studied people
who have been in the United

907
54:36
States for many,
many years – 30,40 years –

908
54:40
and seeing how well they have
come to speak English.

909
54:44
And it turns out the big
determinant of how well you

910
54:47
speak English as an immigrant
isn't how smart you are.

911
54:50
It's not how many family
members you have when you're

912
54:53
here.
It's not your motivation.

913
54:55
It's how old you were when you
started.

914
54:58
It turns out that if you start
learning a language – a second

915
55:02
language is where most of the
work's been done – within the

916
55:06
first few years of life you're
fine.

917
55:08
You'll speak like a native.
But then it starts getting

918
55:13
worse and worse.
And once you hit puberty,

919
55:16
suddenly there's huge variation
in the abilities you have to

920
55:20
learn language.
It is very rare,

921
55:22
for instance,
for somebody who has learned

922
55:25
English past puberty to speak
without an accent.

923
55:28
An accent is very hard to shake
and it's not just an accent.

924
55:31
It's also other aspects of
phonology, syntax,

925
55:35
and morphology.
It's like the part of the brain

926
55:39
that's responsible for language
learning is only around early in

927
55:44
development and if you don't get
your language by then it'll just

928
55:48
run out.
I want to begin next class with

929
55:53
this question,
the question of animals.

930
55:58
And that will shut down the
language learning part.

931
56:01
But one thing I'll put up here
is your second reading response.

932
56:10
So, I'll also put this up on
Wednesday, and by Wednesday you

933
56:13
might have a bit of a better--be
in a better position to answer

934
56:16
this question.
But I'll continue with language

935
56:19
on Wednesday and then we'll also
talk about vision,

936
56:22
attention, and memory.
I'll see you then.

937
