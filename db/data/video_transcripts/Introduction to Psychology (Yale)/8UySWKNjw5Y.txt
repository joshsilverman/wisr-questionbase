Professor Paul Bloom:
On Monday we--I presented an

2
0:16
introduction to evolutionary
psychology, the looking at

3
0:20
psychology from an evolutionary
perspective, and trying to make

4
0:24
a case and give some examples of
how it can help illuminate and

5
0:28
illustrate certain aspects of
how the mind works.

6
0:32
One of the advantages of an
evolutionary perspective on the

7
0:37
mind is that it forces us to
look scientifically at what we

8
0:43
would otherwise take for
granted.

9
0:46
There are a lot of aspects of
how we are and what we are and

10
0:50
what we do that seem so natural
to us.

11
0:52
They come so instinctively and
easily it's difficult,

12
0:56
and sort of unnatural,
to step back and explore them

13
1:00
scientifically but if we're
going to be scientists and look

14
1:03
at the mind from a scientific
perspective we have to get a

15
1:07
sort of distance from ourselves
and ask questions that other

16
1:10
people would not normally think
to ask.

17
1:13
And the clearest case of this
arises with the emotions.

18
1:19
And as a starting point there's
a lovely quote from the

19
1:23
psychologist and philosopher
William James that I want to

20
1:27
begin with.
So, he writes:

21
1:29
To the psychologist alone
can such questions occur as:

22
1:33
Why do we smile when pleased
and not scowl?

23
1:35
Why are we unable to talk to a
crowd as we talk to a single

24
1:39
friend?
Why does a particular maiden

25
1:42
turn our wits upside down?
The common man--[None of you

26
1:45
are the common man.]
The common man can only say,

27
1:48
"Of course we smile.
Of course our heart palpitates

28
1:51
at the sight of the crowd.
Of course we love the maiden.

29
1:54
And so probably does each
animal feel about the particular

30
1:57
things it tends to do in the
presence of certain objects.

31
2:00
To the lion it is the lioness
which is made to be loved;

32
2:03
to the bear the she-bear.
To the broody hen,

33
2:06
the notion would probably seem
monstrous that there should be a

34
2:09
creature in the world to whom a
nestful of eggs was not utterly

35
2:13
fascinating and precious and
never to be too-much-sat-upon

36
2:16
object which it is to her.
Now, there's a few things to

37
2:20
note about this passage.
First, it's incredibly sexist.

38
2:23
It assumes not just merely in
reflexive use of phrases.

39
2:26
It assumes that--William James
assumes he's talking to males,

40
2:30
male humans who sometimes take
the perspective of male bears.

41
2:35
And so, it assumes a male
audience.

42
2:39
You wouldn't normally--You
wouldn't actually ever write

43
2:41
this way.
A second point is it's

44
2:43
beautifully written and you're
not--;also, not allowed to write

45
2:47
that way anymore either.
It's poetic and lyrical and

46
2:51
if--William James
characteristically writes that

47
2:54
way.
I think he writes so much

48
2:57
better than his brother,
Henry James,

49
3:00
an obscure novelist.
[laughter]

50
3:02
Finally though,
the point that he makes is a

51
3:05
terrific one,
which is yes,

52
3:07
all of these things seem
natural to us but the reason why

53
3:12
they seem natural is not because
they are in some sense necessary

54
3:17
or logical truths.
Rather, they emerge from

55
3:21
contingent aspects of our
biological nature.

56
3:25
And so we need to step back.
We actually--We need to step

57
3:29
back and ask questions like--and
these are questions we're going

58
3:33
to ask--Why does poop smell bad?
Avoid the temptation to say,

59
3:37
"Well, poop smells bad because
it's so stinky."

60
3:40
The stinkiness of poop is not
an irreducible fact about the

61
3:45
universe.
Rather, the stinkiness of poop

62
3:47
is a fact about human
psychology.

63
3:50
To a dung beetle poop smells
just fine.

64
3:52
Why does chocolate taste good?
Well, chocolate--The good

65
3:56
tastiness of chocolate isn't
some necessary fact about the

66
4:00
world.
It's a fact about our minds

67
4:03
that doesn't hold true for many
other creatures.

68
4:06
And so, we have to step back
and ask why to us do we find

69
4:10
chocolate appealing?
Why do we love our children?

70
4:14
Don't say they're lovable.
Many of them are not [laughter]

71
4:19
and, as William James points
out, every animal,

72
4:23
most animals,
many animals love their

73
4:26
children.
They think their children are

74
4:28
precious and wonderful.
Why?

75
4:31
Why do we get angry when people
hit us?

76
4:33
Suppose somebody walked up to
you and slapped you in the face?

77
4:37
You'd be afraid.
You'd be angry.

78
4:39
Would you get sleepy,
feel nostalgic,

79
4:44
suddenly desire some cold soup?
[laughter] No.

80
4:50
Those are stupid alternatives.
Of course if somebody slapped

81
4:53
us you would--we would get angry
or afraid.

82
4:56
Why?
Why do we feel good when

83
5:01
someone does us a favor?
Why don't we feel angry?

84
5:06
Why don't we feel fearful?
What we're going to do

85
5:10
throughout this course is step
back and ask these questions.

86
5:13
We're going to ask questions
nobody would have otherwise

87
5:16
thought to ask,
where the common man wouldn't

88
5:19
address,
and this is,

89
5:20
of course, standard in all
sciences.

90
5:23
The first step to insight is to
ask questions like why do things

91
5:29
fall down and not up?
And I imagine the first person

92
5:33
who articulated the question
aloud probably met with the

93
5:35
response saying,
"What a stupid question.

94
5:37
Of course things fall down."
Well, yes, of course things

95
5:41
fall down, but why?
Why is our flesh warm?

96
5:45
Why does water turn solid when
it gets cold?

97
5:48
These are natural facts about
the universe,

98
5:50
but the naturalness needs to be
explained and not merely

99
5:54
assumed.
In this class we're going to

100
5:56
explore, throughout the course,
what seems natural to us and

101
6:00
try to make sense of it.
And to that end we have to ask

102
6:04
questions that you wouldn't
normally ask.

103
6:07
We've already done this to some
extent with domains such as

104
6:10
visual perception,
memory, language and

105
6:13
rationality, but now we're going
to move to the case where it's

106
6:19
maybe even somewhat more
difficult to do this.

107
6:23
Now, we're going to start
dealing with the emotions.

108
6:26
We're going to talk about the
emotions, why they exist,

109
6:29
what they're there for,
and how they work.

110
6:32
I want to start off with the
wrong theory of the emotions.

111
6:36
And the wrong theory of the
emotions is beautifully

112
6:40
illustrated in the television
and movie series Star

113
6:43
Trek.
In this alternative fantasy

114
6:47
world, there are characters,
Mr.

115
6:49
Spock in the original Star
Trek, Data in one of the

116
6:54
spin-offs, who are described as
competent,

117
6:58
capable, in fact in many ways,
super competent and super

118
7:03
capable people.
But they're described as not

119
7:06
having emotions.
Spock is described as not

120
7:09
having emotions because he's
half Vulcan, from a planet where

121
7:12
they lack emotions.
Data is an android who is said

122
7:16
to lack an emotion chip.
This lack of emotions on

123
7:19
this--on a TV series does not
hurt them much.

124
7:21
They're able to fully function.
And in fact,

125
7:24
in a TV series emotions are
often seen as a detriment.

126
7:28
You do better off without them.
And there are many people in

127
7:32
sort of common sense who might
think "Gee, if only I could just

128
7:35
use my rationality,
think reasonably and rationally

129
7:39
and not let my emotions guide my
behavior I'd be much better

130
7:43
off."
It turns out that this is a

131
7:46
notion of how to think about the
emotions that is deeply wrong.

132
7:51
And in fact,
makes no sense at all.

133
7:55
Using the example of Star
Trek, Steven Pinker,

134
7:58
in his book How the Mind
Works, nicely illustrates

135
8:01
the problem here.
He writes, "Spock must have

136
8:05
been driven by some motives or
goals.

137
8:09
Something must have led him to
explore strange new worlds,

138
8:12
to seek out new civilizations
and to boldly go where no man

139
8:16
had gone before."
Presumably, it was intellectual

140
8:19
curiosity that set him to drive
and solve problems.

141
8:22
It was solidarity with his
allies that led him to be such a

142
8:27
competent and brave officer.
What would he have done if

143
8:32
attacked by a predator or an
invading Klingon?

144
8:35
Did he do a handstand,
solve the four-color map

145
8:38
theorem?
Presumably, a part of his brain

146
8:40
quickly mobilized his faculties
to scope out how to flee and how

147
8:45
to take steps to avoid a
vulnerable predicament in the

148
8:49
future.
That is, he had fear.

149
8:52
Spock did not walk around naked
around the ship.

150
8:56
Presumably, he felt modesty.
He got out of bed.

151
9:00
Presumably, he had some
ambitions and drive.

152
9:02
He engaged in conversations.
Presumably, he had some

153
9:05
sociable interests.
Without emotions to drive us we

154
9:08
would do nothing at all.
And you could illustrate this

155
9:12
scientifically.
Creatures like Spock and Data

156
9:16
don't exist in the real world
but there are unusual and

157
9:21
unfortunate cases where people
lose,

158
9:24
to some extent or another,
their emotions.

159
9:27
And you could look at these
people and see what happens to

160
9:31
them.
The classic case,

161
9:33
the most famous case,
is that of a man called Phineas

162
9:37
Gage.
Phineas Gage is the classic

163
9:40
Intro Psych example – an
extremely poor guy,

164
9:43
poor schmuck.
In 1848--He was a construction

165
9:47
foreman.
In 1848 he was working at a

166
9:50
site with explosives and iron
rods.

167
9:54
And due to an explosion,
an iron rod passed through his

168
10:00
head like so.
Imagine that rod shooting

169
10:03
upwards.
It went under his eye and

170
10:05
popped out the top of his head.
It landed about one hundred

171
10:10
feet away covered with blood and
brains.

172
10:13
The rod itself weighed thirteen
pounds.

173
10:17
Amazingly, Gage was not killed.
In fact, he was knocked

174
10:23
unconscious only for a short
period and then he got up and

175
10:27
his friends surrounded him and
asked, "Are you okay?"

176
10:30
And they--And then they took
him to the hospital.

177
10:33
On the way to the hospital,
they stopped by a tavern and he

178
10:37
had a little pint of cider to
drink, sat down and talked to

179
10:40
people.
And then he had an infection,

180
10:43
had to have surgery.
But when it was all said and

181
10:47
done he wasn't blind,
he wasn't deaf,

182
10:50
didn't lose language,
didn't become aphasic,

183
10:53
no paralysis,
no retardation.

184
10:56
In some sense,
what happened was much worse.

185
11:00
He lost his character.
Here's a description at the

186
11:06
time of what Gage was like.
And this is from Damasio's

187
11:10
excellent book Descartes'
Error:

188
11:14
He used to be a really
responsible guy,

189
11:17
a family man,
very reliable,

190
11:19
very trustworthy.
But after the accident he was

191
11:23
fitful, irreverent,
indulging at times in the

192
11:27
grossest profanity,
manifesting but little

193
11:30
deference for his fellows,
impatient of restraint or

194
11:34
advice,
a child in his intellectual

195
11:37
capacities and manifestations.
He had the animal pleasures of

196
11:41
a strong man.
His foul language is so debased

197
11:45
that women are advised not to
stay long in his presence.

198
11:50
And he couldn't hold a job.
He lost his family,

199
11:55
couldn't hold a job.
He ended up in the circus.

200
11:58
He was in the circus going
around the country with his big

201
12:01
iron rod telling everybody the
story as they surrounded him and

202
12:05
clapped.
There are other cases like

203
12:08
Phineas Gage,
cases where people have had

204
12:12
damage to that same part of the
brain, parts of the frontal

205
12:17
cortex.
And what they've lost is they

206
12:22
basically lost a good part of
their emotions.

207
12:26
And what this means is they
don't really care that much

208
12:30
about things.
They can't prioritize.

209
12:33
Damasio tells a case of one of
his patients who was under the

210
12:37
pseudonym here of Elliot.
And Elliot had a tumor in his

211
12:42
frontal lobe.
And the tumor had to be removed

212
12:45
and with it came a lot of
Elliot's frontal lobe.

213
12:48
And again, as a result of this,
Elliot was not struck blind or

214
12:52
deaf or retarded,
and he didn't become the sort

215
12:56
of profane character that
Phineas Gage became,

216
12:59
but he lost the ability to
prioritize.

217
13:04
He lost the ability to set
goals.

218
13:05
Damasio describes him here:

219
13:07


220
13:10
At his job at an activity
he would read and fully

221
13:14
understand the significance of
the material [He works in an

222
13:18
office.]
but the problem was he was

223
13:20
likely,
all of a sudden,

224
13:22
to turn from the task he had
initiated to doing something

225
13:25
else and spending an entire day
doing that.

226
13:27
He might spend an entire
afternoon deliberating on which

227
13:30
principle of categorization he
should apply to files.

228
13:34
Should it be the date or the
size of the document,

229
13:36
pertinence to the case or
another?

230
13:39
He couldn't set his goals.
He couldn't--He ended up not

231
13:42
being able to keep a job,
not being able to deal with

232
13:45
people.
And these are not men who have

233
13:48
lost their emotions.
There is no case around where

234
13:51
you could have your emotions
entirely blotted out.

235
13:54
But they lost a large part of
their emotional capacity and as

236
13:59
a result, their rationality
failed.

237
14:01
Emotions set goals and
establish priorities.

238
14:05
And without them you wouldn't
do anything, you couldn't do

239
14:10
anything.
Your desire to come to class to

240
14:12
study, to go out with friends,
to read a book,

241
14:15
to raise a family,
to be--to do anything are

242
14:20
priorities set by your emotions.
Life would be impossible

243
14:26
without those emotions.
And so, there's certain themes

244
14:30
we're going to explore here.
The first is this,

245
14:33
that emotions are basically
mechanisms that set goals and

246
14:36
priorities and we're going to
talk a lot about--in this class

247
14:40
and the next class about
universals.

248
14:42
We're also going to talk about
culture.

249
14:46
It turns out that cultures,
different cultures,

250
14:49
including differences between
America and Japan and the

251
14:52
American South and the American
North,

252
14:55
have somewhat different
emotional triggers and emotional

253
14:59
baselines to respond to.
But at the same time,

254
15:03
as Darwin well knew,
emotions have universal roots

255
15:07
that are shared across all
humans and across many animals.

256
15:11
So, the agenda for this class
and the next class is going to

257
15:15
go like this.
First, I want to talk a little

258
15:18
bit about facial expressions,
which are ways in which we

259
15:21
communicate our emotions – not
the only way,

260
15:24
but an important way – and
look, in particular,

261
15:27
at the case of smiling because
it's kind of interesting.

262
15:30
Then I want to look at one case
study of a nonsocial emotion,

263
15:34
that of fear.
I want to then deal with

264
15:37
feelings towards our kin,
people we're genetically

265
15:40
related to,
and then--and this will take us

266
15:43
to the next class,
feelings towards non kin.

267
15:45
So first, faces.
And as an introduction to faces

268
15:50
I have a brief film clip from
Paul Ekman, who is one of the

269
15:54
world's great scholars in the
study of facial expressions.

270
15:58
In Ekman's work,
he presents us with

271
16:01
instructions on how to make
different faces and identify

272
16:06
faces.
Ekman actually has a sort of

273
16:08
more practical career along with
his scientific career.

274
16:11
He trains police and secret
service members to try to figure

275
16:15
out cues to honesty and
dishonesty.

276
16:18
There's a very interesting
New Yorker profile on him

277
16:21
by Malcolm Gladwell a few years
ago, something you might be

278
16:23
interested in.
But let's do one of his faces.

279
16:26


280
16:31
Please lower your brows and
draw them together.

281
16:33


282
16:38
That means even those who
aren't making eye contact with

283
16:40
me now.

284
16:41


285
16:44
Tense your lower and upper
eyelids.

286
16:47
Don't pop out contact lenses
but just tense them.

287
16:50


288
16:53
Stare.
Your eyes can bulge somewhat.

289
16:56
[laughter] Okay.
Now, the last part is important.

290
16:59
Press your lips together with
the corners straight or down.

291
17:02
That's good.
You got it.

292
17:05
[laughter] Okay.
Just because you are not making

293
17:09
eye contact with me doesn't mean
I can't see you.

294
17:11
Okay. .
And what face is that?

295
17:20
What emotion does that
correspond to?

296
17:23
Anger.
There's all sorts of databases

297
17:28
of different faces from around.
This guy--I don't know who he

298
17:33
is but he seems to be on a lot
of these things [laughter]

299
17:38
but the thing is you don't need
to rely on him.

300
17:42
You don't need to rely on
Western faces.

301
17:43
Even if you go on line there's,
by now, a lot of databases from

302
17:47
faces from all sorts of genders
and national origins.

303
17:50
This is from a Japanese women
facial expressions.

304
17:54
And there are some subtle and
very interesting differences

305
17:57
across countries and across
people, but there's also deep

306
18:00
universals.
You don't have to work very

307
18:03
hard to figure out what these
different facial expressions

308
18:08
mean.
I want to give one more face

309
18:10
example because I want to focus
on this a little bit.

310
18:13
This one's a little bit easier.
Raise the corners of your lips

311
18:16
back and up, please.

312
18:17


313
18:21
[laughter] Raise your cheeks.
Raise your lower eyelids if you

314
18:27
can.
[laughter] They're smiling.

315
18:30
You're smiling.
You can stop [laughter] smiling.

316
18:35
Yale is actually really big on
smiling.

317
18:39
We have two of the world's
experts on smiling.

318
18:41
This is Angus Trumble,
the curator at the British Art

319
18:46
Gallery who wrote this wonderful
book,

320
18:49
A Brief History of the
Smile looking at the smile

321
18:52
in art.
And this is my colleague,

322
18:54
Marianne LaFrance,
who is actually not smiling in

323
18:57
that picture but she studies
smiling and smiling in adults,

324
19:01
smiling in children,
smiling across cultures,

325
19:04
and the different social uses
of smiling.

326
19:07
And there are some interesting
discoveries people have made

327
19:10
about smiles and about smiles
and the emotions.

328
19:14
One--Oh.
Well, one is that smiles are

329
19:18
universal.
We know, for instance,

330
19:21
that young children smile.
This is my son,

331
19:25
Zachary, when he was younger,
not that weird-looking kid

332
19:31
[laughs]
next to him.

333
19:34
[laughter] Thank God.
[laughter]

334
19:40
And even blind children,
children blind from birth,

335
19:44
will smile.
They'll smile appropriately,

336
19:48
making an important point that
smiling is not learned by

337
19:51
looking at other people's faces.
Smiling is also not uniquely

338
19:56
human.
Nonhuman primates smile as well.

339
20:01
Smiles are social signals.
You might imagine that people

340
20:07
smile when they're happy.
This is actually not the case.

341
20:12
It's not as simple as that.
Rather, people smile when they

342
20:17
wish to communicate happiness
and we know that from several

343
20:23
studies.
There are some studies of

344
20:25
bowlers and the studies are very
nice.

345
20:27
What they do is they film
bowlers.

346
20:29
So, the bowlers do their
bowling and sometimes they knock

347
20:33
down all the pins,
which is called a what?

348
20:36
A strike.
So a strike--and that's good in

349
20:39
the bowling world.
So, they knock down all the

350
20:41
pins but what they don't do,
is they don't smile after they

351
20:44
knock down the pins.
They are being filmed.

352
20:46
They don't smile.
Then they turn around to their

353
20:50
friends and give a big grin.
Other studies have looked at

354
20:55
films of people who have just
won Olympic gold medals.

355
20:59
Now, not surprisingly,
people who have won Olympic

356
21:03
gold medals are very happy.
This is good news to win an

357
21:07
Olympic gold medal.
But they don't actually stand

358
21:11
on the podium grinning.
Rather, they stand there with

359
21:15
their faces in a normal
expression.

360
21:18
Then when they stand up and
face the crowds,

361
21:21
there's a big smile.
You can ask yourself whether

362
21:26
during sex, an activity where
many people enjoy,

363
21:30
whether or not people smile
during sex.

364
21:35
And you can discover this
yourself with [laughter]

365
21:43
a partner or a mirror.
[laughter]

366
21:48
So, there are other things we
know about smiles.

367
21:54
There are different types of
smiles.

368
21:58
There are actually quite a few
different types of smiles that

369
22:01
are different in interesting
ways.

370
22:03
This is Paul Ekman again.

371
22:05


372
22:09
Which one's a better smile?
Who votes for the one on the

373
22:13
right?
Who votes for the one on the

374
22:16
left?
There are two different sorts

375
22:18
of smiles.
The one on the right is a smile

376
22:22
of greeting.
It's sometimes known as a "Pan

377
22:26
Am" smile.
Pan Am is a now defunct airline

378
22:29
which had at that time--They
were--They don't call them

379
22:32
stewardesses anymore but
they're--the stewardesses would

380
22:35
come in and they would smile.
That was part of their job.

381
22:39
But it was a big,
fake smile, the Pan Am smile,

382
22:42
a smile to communicate "hello"
and--but it's as opposed to a

383
22:47
smile where the communication is
that of genuine happiness.

384
22:52
The difference is around the
eyes.

385
22:54
It's not the mouth.
It's the eyes.

386
22:57
A real happiness smile,
what's known as a Duchenne

387
23:01
smile, after a neurophysiologist
who studied it,

388
23:05
involves moving the eyes.
What's interesting is about

389
23:10
only one out of every ten people
can fake a Duchenne smile.

390
23:15
So, if you smile at somebody,
and you just hate their guts

391
23:20
but you want to smile at them,
it's--unless you're quite

392
23:26
gifted it's difficult to fake a
really good, really happy smile.

393
23:33
You could--It's not difficult
to study smiles in the real

394
23:38
world.
You could look at politicians,

395
23:40
for instance.
Politicians are often in

396
23:43
contexts where they have to
smile a lot.

397
23:46
And what they do is they simply
give the Pan Am smile.

398
23:50
The mouth moves up,
particularly if somebody is

399
23:53
attacking their record or
ridiculing them,

400
23:55
and they'll smile and--but it's
not a sincere smile.

401
23:58
The eyes don't move.
My favorite example of this was

402
24:01
a few years ago when there was a
huge battle for the House

403
24:05
majority leader.
And a guy named--a Republican

404
24:09
named John Boehner won this
position in quite a heated

405
24:12
battle.
And they took a picture of the

406
24:15
guy--This is not very nice.
They took a picture of the guy,

407
24:18
Roy Blunt, as he stepped out.
And he had lost and this was

408
24:22
his expression.
[laughter]

409
24:25
And he's not really very happy
[laughter]

410
24:30
as opposed to a smile like
this, which is a real smile.

411
24:36
So, you have two sorts of
smiles: A real happiness smile a

412
24:42
Duchenne smile--called--also
known as the Duchenne smile,

413
24:48
and then a Pan Am smile,
or greeting smile.

414
24:55
And you'll use each of those
smiles at different points in

415
24:58
your day and in your life.
It turns out that these

416
25:01
different smiles have real
psychological validity.

417
25:05
They seem to sort of reflect
deep differences in your mood

418
25:09
and emotions and thoughts.
Ten-month-olds,

419
25:11
for instance,
give different sorts of smiles.

420
25:15
When their mother approaches
there they give a real happiness

421
25:19
smile.
Then when a stranger approaches

422
25:21
or someone else approaches there
they'll tend to give more of a

423
25:24
greeting smile.
John Gottman studied married

424
25:28
couples.
And John Gottman does a lot of

425
25:31
work--Well, what he does is he
looks at film clips of couples.

426
25:34
And by analyzing the film clips
he tries to predict will their

427
25:40
marriages survive.
And one of his cues--There's

428
25:43
different cues.
Incidentally,

429
25:45
sort of side topic:
The death knell for a marriage

430
25:49
for Gottman--This is his big
finding.

431
25:52
It's not if they fight a lot.
It's not they scream at each

432
25:56
other.
It's not even if they hate each

433
26:00
other.
The death knell of a marriage

434
26:03
is contempt.
And so, if he shows these

435
26:07
clips: I walk in,
"Honey, I'm home," and my

436
26:11
spouse has the look of contempt,
it's a bad sign.

437
26:16
[laughter]
But another clue is the sort of

438
26:18
smiles they give when they see
each other when they walk into

439
26:21
the lab.
If it's a true happiness smile,

440
26:24
that's actually bodes better
for the relationship than a Pan

441
26:29
Am, or greeting smile.
Finally, studies have been done

442
26:34
of college yearbook photos
looking at people thirty years

443
26:39
later.
And it turns out that there's a

444
26:42
correlation, a reliable
relationship between how happy

445
26:46
somebody is now and back thirty
years ago in their yearbook

446
26:50
photo--what sort of smile
they're giving.

447
26:53
There is some evidence for a
third sort of smile.

448
26:58
This is known as a coy smile or
an appeasement smile.

449
27:04
This is sort of a very
specialized sort of smile.

450
27:08
This is a smile of
embarrassment or stress.

451
27:13
You give it when you want
people to like you,

452
27:18
you want to join in;
you want to make people feel

453
27:22
positive about you.
But you're in,

454
27:24
sort of, a high-stress
situation often with some sort

455
27:27
of risk.
And what you do is you sort of

456
27:31
you turn away.
There's no eye contact.

457
27:34
You turn away and kind of give
this-- And this actually shows

458
27:37
up in other primates.
Here's a nice picture.

459
27:43
[laughter]
So, the rhesus monkey bites her

460
27:45
own infant, and the infant gives
a scream and then the

461
27:47
submissive, coy smile.
And it also shows up in human

462
27:51
infants.
Here's a nice clip of a coy

463
27:53
baby smile.
I'll walk you through it.

464
27:55
The baby is being approached,
[laughter]

465
27:58
goes like this ,
smiles like this ,

466
28:01
and then the aversion .
Yeah.

467
28:04
Babies are cute.
[laughter]

468
28:08
Any questions at this point
about smiling?

469
28:11


470
28:17
What are your smiling questions?
[laughter] Yeah.

471
28:22
Student: Do nonhuman
primates' smiles [inaudible]

472
28:25
Professor Paul Bloom:
That's a good question.

473
28:27
I don't know.
There's evidence that the coy

474
28:30
smile shows up in non--The
question was,

475
28:33
"Do nonhuman primates give the
same smiles that humans do?"

476
28:37
such as a distinction between
the Pan Am smile,

477
28:40
a greeting smile,
versus a genuine smile of

478
28:42
happiness?
I don't know.

479
28:44
I'll find out for you for next
class though.

480
28:46
That's a good question.
Yeah.

481
28:48
Student: How come some
people's smiles are better than

482
28:52
other people's smiles?
Professor Paul Bloom:

483
28:54
How come some people's smiles
are better than other people's

484
28:56
smiles?
The non-interesting

485
28:57
psychological answer,
some people are better looking

486
29:02
and there's more thing--
[laughter]

487
29:05
but the deeper answer is some
people are better able to smile.

488
29:10
Some people are better able to
use the cues to express true

489
29:14
happiness.
There's something else about

490
29:17
smiles which is going to come
up, which your question raises,

491
29:20
I think, which is going to come
up in--when we talk about

492
29:24
emotional contagion and
actually,

493
29:27
some issues of morality.
Smiles are extremely contagious.

494
29:32
So, what I'd like people to
do--If you're sitting next to

495
29:35
somebody, please turn around and
find someone next to you and

496
29:39
look at them.
Don't do anything.

497
29:40
Just look at them.
Whoever is being looked at,

498
29:43
look back.
[laughter]

499
29:45
This is not-- [laughter]
Please arbitrarily decide.

500
29:49
Okay.
Please arbitrarily decide on

501
29:52
the smiler.
That will be--No,

502
29:54
not at me, at each other,
[laughter]

503
29:56
and that will be the person--If
you are unable to resolve this

504
30:00
dispute--yes,
you two, please--if you are

505
30:03
unable to resolve this dispute,
the person to the right of me

506
30:06
will be the smiler.
So, look at each other

507
30:10
expressionless.
[laughter]

508
30:13
Now, the person who is the
mandated smiler,

509
30:16
[laughter]
on three, please smile.

510
30:19
One, two, three.
[laughter] Okay.

511
30:28
[laughter]
Worst class demo ever

512
30:33
[laughter]
but if one could imagine more

513
30:38
restrained circumstances,
it is actually extremely

514
30:44
difficult to be facing somebody
who's really smiling at you and

515
30:50
not smile.
This is true,

516
30:52
by the way, for virtually every
other emotion.

517
30:55
The phenomena is known as
"emotional contagion," where if

518
30:59
you're facing somebody,
for instance,

519
31:02
and they're--they look at you
in a face of absolute rage,

520
31:05
it is very difficult to just
sit there without your own face

521
31:09
molding in accord to their own.
And the reasons why this

522
31:13
happens and how that works is
something we'll talk about later

523
31:17
on.
So that's--One more question.

524
31:23
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

525
31:26
Professor Paul Bloom: I
don't know if that's--The

526
31:30
question is,
"Is there a difference between

527
31:33
smiling with your teeth versus
just your lips closed?"

528
31:37
There probably is.
That's not a main smile

529
31:40
difference but my bet is that
there probably is a difference.

530
31:44
And my bet also is that that
sort of distinction,

531
31:47
how much teeth you show when
you smile,

532
31:50
is the sort of thing that would
show regional and country by

533
31:54
country differences.
For instance,

534
31:55
there's been research finding
that people in England smile

535
31:58
different from people in the
United States.

536
32:00
And I think that those are the
sort of contrasts that you would

537
32:03
expect to find in cross-cultural
differences.

538
32:05
Every culture is going to have
Pan Am smiles,

539
32:07
happiness smiles,
coy smiles, but the variation

540
32:10
of that sort is something which
will vary as a result of how

541
32:13
you're raised and the people
around you.

542
32:16


543
32:23
I want to deal with a few
emotions in this class and next

544
32:27
and the first case study of an
emotion I want to deal with is

545
32:31
the emotion of fear.
And I want to deal with fear

546
32:34
for different reasons.
One reason is it's a basic

547
32:37
emotion, it's universal.
All humans have it.

548
32:41
Many nonhumans,
probably most nonhuman,

549
32:43
species have it too.
And it also brings us back to

550
32:46
the lecture on behaviorism where
we talked about classical

551
32:50
conditioning and different
theories of what people are

552
32:53
afraid of.
It's a nonsocial emotion.

553
32:59
What I mean by this is it's
possible, of course,

554
33:02
to be afraid of a person,
but unlike an emotion like

555
33:06
gratitude, it's not
intrinsically social.

556
33:09
You could be afraid of falling
off a cliff or something.

557
33:12
It has a distinctive facial
expression again.

558
33:14
This is a famous picture of Lee
Harvey Oswald who was being

559
33:21
assassinated by Jack Ruby.
And this is the detective's

560
33:26
face standing there,
a mixture of fear and anger –

561
33:30
the face being drawn back in a
universal expression that every

562
33:34
human everywhere would be able
to recognize.

563
33:37
So, the basic question to ask
is "What are we afraid of?"

564
33:41
And the answer's a little bit
interesting.

565
33:46
We're afraid of spiders,
snakes, heights,

566
33:48
storms, large animals,
darkness, blood,

567
33:51
strangers, humiliation,
deep water, and leaving home

568
33:54
alone.
We are afraid of other things

569
33:56
too but those are big things to
be afraid of.

570
34:00
I'm not even going to ask.
If there's somebody who--in

571
34:02
this room, who's not afraid of
any of those things?

572
34:05
You're a tougher person than I
am.

573
34:07
These are universal fear
elicitors.

574
34:10
Why?
What do they have in common?

575
34:13
Why would you be afraid of
those things?

576
34:15
And the answer is--And why
would--why are there so few

577
34:19
people afraid of guns,
cars, and electrical outlets?

578
34:23
The answer is not particularly
surprising.

579
34:27
These are things
that--something's ticking over

580
34:31
there.
These are things that are scary

581
34:34
in our ancestral environment.
More particularly,

582
34:37
these are things that through
the course of human evolution

583
34:41
have been dangerous to us.
And so, we are afraid of these

584
34:45
things and not so afraid of
these things;

585
34:50
similarly for nonhuman primates.
So, chimpanzees are afraid of

586
34:55
certain things and they can
often develop phobias for

587
34:58
certain things,
but the phobias they develop,

588
35:01
the fears they develop,
are things like spiders and

589
35:04
snakes.
There was a nice study done in

590
35:07
urban Chicago,
in the inner city of Chicago.

591
35:10
And they asked children raised
in the inner city,

592
35:12
"What are you most afraid of?"
And you might think they would

593
35:16
say, "I'm afraid of being shot.
I'm afraid of guns.

594
35:20
I'm afraid of being killed by
somebody or being harmed by

595
35:24
somebody.
I'm afraid of being run over by

596
35:27
a car."
The two biggest fears of

597
35:30
children in urban Chicago are
that , snakes and spiders,

598
35:36
even though many of these
children have probably never

599
35:40
seen a snake outside of a zoo in
their lives.

600
35:43
These are natural fears.
There is some research done by

601
35:46
the psychologist Judy DeLoache
at University of Virginia where

602
35:50
she's studying babies' fears of
spiders and snakes,

603
35:54
babies obviously who,
since their parents are normal,

604
35:57
have not yet seen spiders and
snakes.

605
36:00
There are various ethical
reasons why you can't show

606
36:04
babies--you can't try to
construct phobias in babies of

607
36:09
spiders and snakes but the
research she's finding using

608
36:13
more indirect methods finds,
as one would expect,

609
36:17
these are what psychologists
would call "pre-potent stimuli";

610
36:20
that is, these are things that
naturally elicit fear and

611
36:24
concern.
And that's all I have to say

612
36:28
about fear.
I want to turn for the rest of

613
36:32
this lecture and for next
lecture next week to the social

614
36:39
emotions.
And the social emotions can be

615
36:42
broken down into two categories.
Bless you, bless you.

616
36:47
Those emotions you feel towards
your kin, towards your genetic

617
36:51
relatives, and those emotions
that you feel towards the people

618
36:56
you're not related to but
interact with.

619
37:00
And I want to focus
particularly on emotions that

620
37:06
generate kind or altruistic
behavior.

621
37:12
"Altruism" is the biologists'
term meaning kindness,

622
37:16
generosity, and evolutionary
biologists have worked really

623
37:20
hard to explain why animals
might evolve to be kind.

624
37:25


625
37:28
A very old, very wrong view of
evolution is that evolution has

626
37:33
shaped animals such that they're
merely survival machines.

627
37:38
If so, then from an
evolutionary standpoint any

628
37:42
kindness towards an animal--that
an animal shows towards another

629
37:47
animal--is a mystery.
If evolution wired us up simply

630
37:51
to survive, then it's a puzzle
why animals would relate

631
37:56
positively to other animals.
But of course, that's not true.

632
38:03
Here's a simple example showing
it's not true.

633
38:07
Imagine two genes,
two sorts of animals each

634
38:10
containing their own gene.
Gene "A" makes an animal care

635
38:13
for its offspring.
Gene "B" makes an animal care

636
38:17
only for itself.
Imagine what will happen in the

637
38:20
next generation.
Plainly, Gene "A" will win out.

638
38:24
It's a very simple case.
An animal who has evolved a

639
38:28
brain that says,
"Take care of your offspring"

640
38:31
will do much better from a
natural selection point of view

641
38:35
from an animal who has evolved a
brain that says,

642
38:38
"Eat your offspring."
The animal that eats its

643
38:41
offspring, those genes are a
biological dead end.

644
38:44
What matters then is not
survival, per se.

645
38:48
What matters is reproduction.
And so, that simple fact is why

646
38:54
we would expect animals to care
for their children,

647
38:58
because children are the means
through which genes replicate.

648
39:03
But it gets a little bit richer
than that.

649
39:06
And this is one of the major
revolutions in evolutionary

650
39:10
biology over the last half
century.

651
39:13
Forget about the animal a bit
and take another perspective.

652
39:18
Take a perspective of the cold
virus.

653
39:21
People have been sneezing in
the front row.

654
39:24
Now, you're coughing.
Thank you.

655
39:27
Why do you sneeze when you get
a cold?

656
39:29
Here's not a-- Point made.
Here is--Here's not a bad

657
39:36
answer.
You sneeze because you've got

658
39:39
all these germs inside you and
your body wants to get the germs

659
39:42
out, so you sneeze.
It's not that it's totally

660
39:45
wrong, but it's not bad.
The real answer is a little bit

661
39:49
more interesting.
Don't look at it from the

662
39:52
person's perspective.
If you have a cold,

663
39:54
try to get away from your own
selfish perspective,

664
39:57
"I have a cold."
Look at it from the perspective

665
40:01
of the cold virus.
The cold virus has evolved just

666
40:04
as much as you evolved.
And it's evolved due to

667
40:08
survival and reproduction.
What the cold virus does is

668
40:11
evolve different strategies to
cause it to reproduce.

669
40:15
And what it does is--one way to
reproduce is to occupy other

670
40:20
animals and manipulate their
bodies so as to expel it.

671
40:25
From this point of view then,
the reason why you sneeze when

672
40:29
you have a cold is that your
cold--the cold virus is using

673
40:33
your body as a tool to replicate
itself.

674
40:36
From this person--this
perspective, a person is just a

675
40:40
germ's way of making other
germs.

676
40:42
And there's tons of other
examples of this.

677
40:45
There's a parasite known as
toxoplasmosis that lives in the

678
40:50
bodies of rats.
But it gets passed on when the

679
40:53
rats get eaten by cats.
And then it ends up in the

680
40:57
cats' feces and then it ends up
back in rats.

681
40:59
If you are a rat and you have
toxoplasmosis,

682
41:03
you are perfectly healthy
except for one thing.

683
41:07
The toxoplasmosis rewires your
brain and it makes you less

684
41:11
afraid of cats.
Now, again, this is not some

685
41:16
sort of bizarre quirk of a
humorous god.

686
41:20
Rather, it's because this is a
perfectly--this is the adaptive

687
41:24
strategy of the toxoplasmosis
virus.

688
41:27
In fact, a real powerful virus
would skip the respiratory

689
41:32
system altogether,
even better than a cold virus.

690
41:36
What it would do is it would
take over the brain and it will

691
41:39
make people want to run around
and have sex with other people

692
41:43
and kiss them on the mouth.
And in fact,

693
41:46
there is some evidence that
this happens.

694
41:50
There's some evidence,
for instance,

695
41:52
that one of the effects of
sexually transmitted diseases

696
41:55
like syphilis is it arouses the
libido,

697
41:57
makes people more sexually
engaged, because this is part of

698
42:01
the strategy through which these
viruses replicate themselves.

699
42:04
Imagine a virus,
for instance,

700
42:07
that captured an animal's brain
and then modified the animal's

701
42:11
brain such that the animal would
run out and bite other animals

702
42:16
so as to pass on the virus.
And then, of course,

703
42:20
you would call that virus
"rabies."

704
42:23
Along these lines,
the evolutionary biologist

705
42:27
Richard Dawkins took the general
step of suggesting that animals

706
42:32
are the vehicles through which
genes exploit to reproduce.

707
42:37
From this perspective,
an animal is just the

708
42:40
person's--is just the gene's way
of creating another animal.

709
42:45
Well, as psychologists,
what benefit does that--does

710
42:49
this way of analysis give us?
It actually can help us explain

711
42:53
altruism.
So, which genes are going to

712
42:56
survive?
Well, the genes that survive

713
42:58
are going to be the ones that
make the most copies of

714
43:01
themselves.
Animals are vehicles through

715
43:02
which genes reproduce.
An animal's merely the gene's

716
43:06
way of making another gene.
Hence, selfish genes will lead

717
43:09
to altruistic animals because,
to the extent that evolution

718
43:13
operates at the level of the
genes,

719
43:15
there's no hard and fast
distinction between your own

720
43:20
body and someone else's body.
And here's an illustration by

721
43:25
the biologist Haldane.
So, Haldane was once asked,

722
43:28
"Would you lay down your life
for your brother?"

723
43:32
And he responded,
"No, but I would gladly give my

724
43:36
life for three brothers or five
nephews or nine first cousins."

725
43:41
Now, he's joking.
You don't actually do the math

726
43:46
if you're normal.
But what he's capturing is the

727
43:49
logic, the ultimate causation of
our feelings towards our kin.

728
43:55
Our genes have wired us up--our
brains up to love our children

729
44:00
and love our kin because,
in this way,

730
44:03
our genes manage to replicate
themselves.

731
44:06
And in fact,
you get his calculations by

732
44:11
looking at genetic relatedness.
The genetic relatedness,

733
44:16
from an evolutionary
standpoint, affects how much you

734
44:19
care for other people.
From the standpoint of your

735
44:23
genes, you dying for the life of
three brothers is an excellent

736
44:28
compromise because the genes
replicate by fifty percent more.

737
44:33
If you imagined--;So,
here is his calculations.

738
44:37
If you imagined a choice
between this one gene that makes

739
44:40
the animal choose to die and the
other gene that makes an animal

740
44:44
choose for its brothers to die,
the gene that sacrifices the

741
44:48
body it belongs to will make
more copies in the future.

742
44:52
And there's an interesting
irony to this.

743
44:54
The selfish gene theory is
often seen as sort of a

744
44:57
cold-blooded evolutionary
analysis,

745
44:59
but it provides a scientific
basis for real,

746
45:03
genuine altruism,
for really arguing that,

747
45:07
from the standpoint of the
genes, there really is no hard

748
45:11
and fast difference between
yourself and another person.

749
45:15
From this perspective,
we can start to answer some

750
45:19
interesting questions at least
about nonhumans.

751
45:22
When a new male lion takes over
a pride what he does is kill all

752
45:27
the remaining cubs and any
lionesses undergo spontaneous

753
45:32
abortions.
This all might seem very cruel

754
45:35
but from a genetic standpoint it
makes sense.

755
45:39
The other cubs are genetic
competition for him.

756
45:43
They do not have his genes.
Moreover, only once they're out

757
45:48
of the way can he reproduce and
copulate with the females.

758
45:52
The females do their
spontaneous abortions because

759
45:56
that's a reliable adaptive
trick.

760
45:59
These cubs are not going to
survive once they are born so

761
46:02
the female's best strategy is to
get rid of them and start anew.

762
46:06
From a psychological point
then, animals have evolved to be

763
46:09
nice to their kin,
particularly their children,

764
46:12
and particularly in birds and
mammals.

765
46:15
Birds and mammals invest in
quality and not quantity,

766
46:19
as opposed to fish and
reptiles.

767
46:21
For birds and mammals,
we don't have many kids but--so

768
46:27
we devote a huge amount of
psychological energy to

769
46:32
protecting the ones that we
have.

770
46:36
Moreover, the kids we have are
vulnerable for long periods of

771
46:40
time and require our resources.
So, there's various

772
46:44
psychological mechanisms that
this gives rise to.

773
46:47
One is how parents or how
adults in general respond to

774
46:51
children.
Another one is how children

775
46:54
respond to parents.
And I'll briefly talk about a

776
46:56
few of these phenomena.

777
46:57


778
47:06
Small animals make distress
calls.

779
47:10
They chirp, they mew,
they bleat or they cry.

780
47:13
The governing of a distress
call is actually an extremely

781
47:17
delicate high-wire act for any
young organism from an

782
47:20
evolutionary point of view.
It has to on the one hand be

783
47:25
annoying enough to actually
generate help,

784
47:28
to get people to help you,
to feed you,

785
47:31
to pick you up,
to take you and put them next

786
47:33
to you.
On the other hand,

787
47:35
it can't be so annoying that
the people around you kill you

788
47:39
[laughter]
and so it's complicated.

789
47:41
But, from your point of view,
you're wired up to respond to

790
47:45
them.
That sound is,

791
47:47
at very minimum,
extremely annoying.

792
47:50
And it's more--it's not
annoying because of its volume

793
47:54
or pitch.
It's annoying because your

794
47:57
brains are wired up so that that
baby cry is going to drive you

795
48:01
up the wall.
On the more positive side,

796
48:05
babies are cute.
I got this from Google Images,

797
48:10
typing in "cute baby,"
[laughter]

798
48:12
getting rid of the porn and
[laughter]

799
48:16
coming on to that.
No, no, Playboy,

800
48:20
but anyway it was over that.
[laughter]

801
48:23
And do not be tempted to say,
"Isn't it wonderful that the

802
48:27
way nature works is that babies
are cute?

803
48:30
Otherwise we would have killed
them."

804
48:34
[laughter]
That's not the right story.

805
48:36
If--Babies are not--Human
babies are not,

806
48:39
sort of, metaphysically cute.
If Martians came down they

807
48:42
wouldn't say,
"Oh, cute baby."

808
48:44
Rather, they're cute because of
how our brains are wired up.

809
48:47
They're cute because there are
certain cues that correspond to

810
48:52
the way our brains work.
And in fact,

811
48:55
this is how it works for all
mammals.

812
48:57
So, babies have these big,
protruding foreheads,

813
49:02
an upturned little nose,
chubby cheeks and big eyes.

814
49:07
Those are the ingredients for
cute.

815
49:10
Stephen Jay Gould has a
wonderful essay where he

816
49:12
discussed this,
looking at the evolution of

817
49:14
Mickey Mouse from the Walt
Disney character.

818
49:17
Mickey Mouse starts off as an
ugly, little rodent.

819
49:20
[laughter]
Over time he gets cuter and

820
49:23
cuter and cuter as the artist
converged on more and more

821
49:26
baby-like features.
Studies of adults show what's

822
49:30
known as a baby-face bias.
This is not unique to the

823
49:34
United States.
The same studies have been done

824
49:37
in Asia.
You find a baby face in an

825
49:40
adult, Leonardo DiCaprio,
to be particularly naive,

826
49:45
helpless, kind and warm.
And in mock trials,

827
49:49
people with baby faces are more
likely to be found innocent than

828
49:54
people like Ben Affleck,
[laughter]

829
49:57
who do not have baby faces.
[laughter]

830
50:00
Now, one question which is
going to come up for an entire

831
50:05
lecture later on is "who is
sexier, the baby faced man or

832
50:10
Testosterone Man?"
here .

833
50:14
[laughter]
And I am going to ask actually

834
50:15
for a vote because I'm going to
return to this.

835
50:17
I do not--I only want the men
to vote, please.

836
50:22
Who would go for--And forget
the fact that he looks sort of

837
50:26
unhappy.
Who would go for Ben Affleck

838
50:28
here?
Okay.

839
50:31
[laughter]
Who would go for Leonardo?

840
50:33
Okay.
[laughter]

841
50:35
Well, the women votes would
actually be more complicated.

842
50:39
We will discuss when we get the
lecture on sex.

843
50:41
Your choice will depend on
where you are in the menstrual

844
50:46
cycle.
[laughter]

845
50:48
Now, so far,
we're talking about how babies

846
50:53
respond to--We're talking about
our responses to babies.

847
51:01
What about babies' responses to
us?

848
51:04
Well, there's a very old theory
known as the "Cupboard Theory"

849
51:09
proposed by the behaviorist B.F.
Skinner which argues that

850
51:13
babies' attachment to their
parents is because the parent

851
51:17
provides food,
characteristically breast milk,

852
51:21
but it could be food from a
bottle or whatever.

853
51:23
And because of operant
conditioning,

854
51:26
the baby is driven towards the
adult.

855
51:29


856
51:33
An alternative theory is that
of Bowlby, which is that they're

857
51:37
drawn to their mother for
comfort and social interaction

858
51:41
as well as fear of strangers.
To test this,

859
51:45
the psychologist Harlow
performed a series of ingenious

860
51:50
experiments with nonhuman
primates distinguishing between

861
51:55
what he called "wire mothers"
and "cloth mothers."

862
52:00
And you'll see illustrations of
this to follow.

863
52:03
Wire mothers are mothers that
are built that they give food.

864
52:07
They have a little nipple
attached and you can drink from

865
52:10
it and give food to the baby.
And that's the baby's source of

866
52:13
food.
Cloth mothers don't give any

867
52:15
food but they give warmth and
comfort.

868
52:18
There was a while in the
psychology department where one

869
52:21
professor was known to be
extremely supportive to his

872
52:28

873
52:32
provided no love.

874
52:35
mother.

next class by wrapping up and
explaining the Harlow studies in

882
53:07
more detail and what they tell
us.

883
53:09
And then we'll move towards
altruism, towards non kin.

884
53:13
I'll see you next week.
