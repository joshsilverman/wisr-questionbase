Professor Paul Bloom:
We began the course by talking

2
0:16
about one of the foundational
ideas of modern psychology.

3
0:20
This is what Francis Crick
described as "The Astonishing

4
0:24
Hypothesis," the idea that our
mental life,

5
0:26
our consciousness,
our morality,

6
0:28
our capacity to make decisions
and judgments is the product of

7
0:32
a material physical brain.
What I want to talk about today

8
0:36
and introduce it,
and it's going to be a theme

9
0:38
that we're going to continue
throughout the rest of the

10
0:40
course,
is a second idea which I think

11
0:43
is equally shocking,
perhaps more shocking.

12
0:46
And this has to do with where
mental life comes from,

13
0:50
not necessary its material
nature, but rather its origin.

14
0:54
And the notion,
this other "astonishing

15
0:57
hypothesis," is what the
philosopher Daniel Dennett has

16
1:01
described as Darwin's dangerous
idea.

17
1:04
And this is the modern
biological account of the origin

18
1:09
of biological phenomena
including psychological

19
1:13
phenomena.
Now, people have long been

20
1:16
interested in the evolution of
complicated things.

21
1:20
And there is an argument that's
been repeated throughout history

22
1:25
and many people have found it
deeply compelling,

23
1:28
including Darwin himself.
Darwin, as he wrote The

24
1:31
Origin of Species, was
deeply persuaded and moved by

25
1:35
this argument from--in the form
presented by the theologian

26
1:39
William Paley.
So, Paley has an example here.

27
1:43
Paley tells--gives the example
of you're walking down the beach

28
1:46
and your foot hits a rock.
And then you wonder,

29
1:48
"Where did that rock come
from?"

30
1:50
And you don't really expect an
interesting answer to that

31
1:53
question.
Maybe it was always there.

32
1:54
Maybe it fell from the sky.
Who cares?

33
1:57
But suppose you found a watch
on the ground and then you asked

34
2:01
where the watch had come from.
Paley points out that it would

35
2:05
not be satisfying to simply say
it's always been there or it

36
2:10
came there as an accident.
And he uses this comparison to

37
2:15
make a point,
which is a watch is a very

38
2:18
complicated and interesting
thing.

39
2:22
Paley is--was a medical doctor
and Paley goes on to describe a

40
2:27
watch and compare a watch to the
eye and noticing that a watch

41
2:32
and the eye contain multitudes
of parts that interact in

42
2:36
complicated ways to do
interesting things.

43
2:40
In fact, to change and to
update the analogy a little bit,

44
2:44
an eye is very much like a
machine known as a camera.

45
2:48
And they're similar at a deep
way.

46
2:52
They both have lenses that bend
light and project an image onto

47
2:55
a light-sensitive surface.
For the eye the light-sensitive

48
2:58
surface is the retina.
For the camera it's the film.

49
3:02
They both have a focusing
mechanism.

50
3:04
For the eye it's muscles that
change the shape of the lens.

51
3:08
For a camera it's a diaphragm
that governs the amount of

52
3:12
incoming light.
Even they're both encased in

53
3:16
black.
The light-sensitive part of the

54
3:18
eye and part of the camera are
both encased in black.

55
3:22
The difference is--So in fact,
the eye and a camera look a lot

56
3:27
alike and we know the camera is
an artifact.

57
3:30
The camera has been constructed
by an intelligent--by

58
3:34
intelligent beings to fulfill a
purpose.

59
3:37
In fact, if there's any
difference between things like

60
3:39
the eye and things like a
camera,

61
3:41
the difference is that things
like the eye are far more

62
3:45
complicated than things like the
camera.

63
3:48
When I was a kid I had this
incredible TV show called "The

64
3:51
Six Million Dollar Man."
Anybody here ever seen it or

65
3:55
heard of it?
Oh.

66
3:57
Anyway, the idea is there's a
test pilot, Steve Austin,

67
4:02
and his rocket jet crashes and
he loses his--both legs,

68
4:07
his arm and his eye,
which sounds really bad but

69
4:10
they replace them with bionic
stuff,

70
4:12
with artificial leg,
artificial arm and an

71
4:14
artificial eye that are really
super-powered.

72
4:17
And then he fights crime.
[laughter]

73
4:20
It was [laughs]
really the best show on.

74
4:22
It was really good,
[laughter]

75
4:24
but the thing is this was in
1974.

76
4:27
It's now over thirty years
later and it's true then and

77
4:32
it's true now,
this is fantasy.

78
4:35
It doesn't make it to the level
of science fiction.

79
4:37
It's fantasy.
We are impossibly far away from

80
4:40
developing machines that could
do this.

81
4:43
We are impossibly far away from
building a machine that can do

82
4:47
what the human eye does.
And so somebody like Paley

83
4:51
points out, "Look.
The complexity of the

84
4:54
biological world suggests that
these things are complicated

85
4:58
artifacts created by a designer
far smarter than any human

86
5:02
engineer.
And the designer,

87
5:05
of course, would be God."
I went to Goggle Images.

88
5:09
That--I don't mean that to be
sacrilegious [laughter]

89
5:12
in any sense.
You could try this.

90
5:14
I went to "Google Images" and
typed in "God" and this is what

91
5:19
showed up right in the middle
so--And this,

92
5:23
Paley argued,
and it was--has been convincing

93
5:26
throughout most of history,
is a perfectly logical

94
5:28
explanation for where these
complicated things come from.

95
5:32
It also has the advantage of
being compatible with scripture

96
5:35
and compatible with religious
beliefs, but Paley made the

97
5:39
point this stands on its own.
If you find complicated things

98
5:43
that--complicated artifacts,
you don't assume they emerged

99
5:47
by accident.
You assume that they were

100
5:50
created by an intelligent being.
Now, this view has always had

101
5:55
problems.
This view, you could call it

102
5:58
"creationism," which is that
biological structures were

103
6:01
created by an intelligent being,
has always had problems.

104
6:05
One problem is it pushes back
the question.

105
6:08
So you ask, "Where did that
intelligent being come from?"

106
6:11
And this is a particularly
serious problem from the

107
6:14
standpoint of the evolution of
psychological structures.

108
6:17
So, we want to know,
"how is it that creatures came

109
6:20
across--upon this earth with the
ability to reason and plan and

110
6:25
do things?"
And then the answer is "well,

111
6:28
another creature with that
ability created us."

112
6:30
That doesn't necessarily mean
it's wrong, but it means it's

113
6:34
unsatisfying.
You immediately want to get an

114
6:36
explanation for where that other
creature comes from.

115
6:38
More to the point,
there's always been evidence

116
6:41
for evolution.
And what I mean by evolution

117
6:44
here isn't necessarily a
specific mechanism,

118
6:47
but merely the fact that body
parts like the eye didn't emerge

119
6:51
all of a sudden,
but rather have parallels both

120
6:55
within other existing animals
and across human and biological

121
7:00
history.
This evidence comes in

122
7:03
different forms.
There is fossil evidence for

123
7:07
different body parts suggesting
that they have evolved from more

124
7:10
rudimentary form.
There is vestigial

125
7:13
characteristics.
And what this means is there

126
7:16
are characteristics that human
bodies have that are somewhat

127
7:20
inexplicable,
like the human tailbone or

128
7:23
goose-bumps, unless you view
them--the human body in its

129
7:28
current form as modifications
from a previous form.

130
7:32
There are parallels with other
animals.

131
7:35
And this is clear in psychology.
So, a human brain is different

132
7:38
from the rat,
cat, and monkey brain but at

133
7:41
the same time you see them
following a sort of common plan

134
7:44
and common structures.
And one rational inference from

135
7:48
this is that they're linked
through evolutionary descent.

136
7:52
Finally, there is occasional
poor design.

137
7:55
So, Paley rhapsodized about the
remarkable powers of the human

138
8:00
body and the different body
parts,

139
8:03
but even Paley admitted that
there are some things which just

140
8:06
don't work very well.
Your eye contains a blind spot

141
8:09
because of how the nerves are
wired up.

142
8:11
In the male urinary system the
urethra goes through the

143
8:16
prostate gland instead of around
it,

144
8:19
which leads to many physical
problems in men later on in

145
8:22
life.
And so you're forced to either

146
8:24
argue that these are really good
things or that God is either

147
8:29
malicious or incompetent.
And those are difficult

148
8:33
arguments to make.
So, these are problems with the

149
8:36
creationist view.
But still, for the longest time

150
8:39
in human intellectual history
there was no alternative.

151
8:42
And in fact,
Richard Dawkins,

152
8:44
the most prominent
evolutionary--one of the most

153
8:48
prominent evolutionary
biologists alive and one of the

154
8:52
most staunchest critics of
creationism,

155
8:55
has written in The Blind
Watchmaker saying,

156
8:58
look, anybody 100 years ago or
150 years ago who didn't believe

157
9:03
that God created humans and
other animals was a moron

158
9:07
because the argument from design
is a damn good argument.

159
9:11
And in the absence of some
other argument you should

160
9:14
go--defer to that.
You should say,

161
9:17
"Well, there are all of these
problems but humans and other

162
9:20
biological forms must have
divine creation because of their

163
9:24
incredible rich and intricate
structure."

164
9:28
What changed all that of course
was Darwin.

165
9:31
And Darwin--Darwin's profound
accomplishment was showing how

166
9:37
you get these complicated
biological structures,

167
9:41
like the eye,
emerging through a purely

168
9:45
non-intentional,
non-created process,

169
9:49
a purely physical process.
And this could be seen as equal

170
9:54
in importance to the claim that
the Earth revolves around the

171
9:58
Sun and that we're not the
center of the universe.

172
10:03
And in fact,
some scholars have made a

173
10:05
suggestion which seems
plausible, that the idea of

174
10:08
natural selection is the most
important idea in the sciences,

175
10:12
period.
So, this is not a course in

176
10:15
evolution and I expect people to
have some background.

177
10:17
If you don't have a background
in it, you could get your

178
10:20
background from external
readings but also from--the Gray

179
10:24
textbook and the Norton readings
will both--will each provide you

180
10:27
with enough background to get up
to speed.

181
10:30
But the general idea is that
there are three components to

182
10:33
natural selection.
There is variation.

183
10:36
And this variation gives rise
to different degrees of survival

184
10:39
and reproduction and gets passed
on from generation to generation

185
10:44
and gives rise to adaptations,
what Darwin described as "that

186
10:48
perfection of structure that
justly excites our imagination."

187
10:53
And the biological world has
all sorts of examples.

188
10:57
You look at camouflage.
Prior to Darwin one might

189
11:01
imagine that some intelligent
creator crafted animals to hide

190
11:05
from their prey.
But now we have a different

191
11:08
alternative, which is that
animals that were better hidden

192
11:11
survive better,
reproduce more,

193
11:13
and over the course of
thousands, perhaps millions of

194
11:17
years,
they've developed elaborate

195
11:19
camouflage.
There's been a lot of work on

196
11:22
Paley's favorite example – the
eye.

197
11:25
So Darwin himself noted that
the human eye did not seem to

198
11:28
emerge all at once but rather
you could look at other animals

199
11:32
and find parallels in other
animals that seem to suggest

200
11:36
that more rudimentary forms are
possible.

201
11:39
And more recently computer
simulations have developed--have

202
11:44
been developed that have crafted
eyes under plausible assumptions

203
11:49
of selective pressure and what
the starting point is.

204
11:53
So, this is the theory of
natural selection.

205
11:57
The good question to ask is,
"why am I talking about

206
12:00
evolution in Introduction to
Psychology class?"

207
12:03
And the answer is that there
are two ideas which come

208
12:08
together.
And in fact,

209
12:10
they're both of the dangerous
ideas.

210
12:12
One idea is that Darwin's
idea--that biological forms

211
12:17
evolve through this purely
physical process.

212
12:21
The second idea,
the rejection of Descartes,

213
12:24
is that our minds are the
product of physical things and

214
12:29
physical events.
You bring these together and it

215
12:33
forces you to the perspective
that what we are--our mental

216
12:38
life is no less than the eye,
no less than camouflage,

217
12:42
the product of this purely
physical process of natural

218
12:45
selection.
More to the point,

219
12:48
our cognitive mechanisms were
evolved not to please God,

220
12:53
not as random accidents,
but rather for the purpose of

221
12:57
survival and reproduction.
More contentiously,

222
13:00
you could argue they've been
shaped by natural selection to

223
13:04
solve certain problems.
And so, from an evolutionary

224
13:07
point of view,
when you look at what the brain

225
13:09
is and what the brain does,
you look at it in terms of

226
13:12
these problems.
And this is what psychology is

227
13:21
for.
This is what our thinking is

228
13:24
for.
We have evolved mental

229
13:26
capacities to solve different
problems: perception of the

230
13:30
world, communication,
getting nutrition and rest,

231
13:33
and so on.
Now, we're going to talk about

232
13:38
how to apply evolutionary theory
to psychology.

233
13:44
But as we're doing so we have
to keep in mind two

234
13:47
misconceptions.
There are two ways you can go

235
13:50
seriously wrong here.
The first is to think that,

236
13:53
well, if we're taking an
evolutionary approach then

237
13:56
natural selection will cause
animals to want to spread their

238
14:00
genes.
So, if we're being biological

239
14:02
about it, that means everybody
must run around thinking "I want

240
14:06
to spread my genes."
I want to--and this is just

241
14:10
really --Oops.
I shouldn't do that.

242
14:13
This is really wrong.
It's even in red.

243
14:19
And what this fails to do is
make a distinction between

244
14:22
ultimate causation and proximate
causation.

245
14:25
And those are technical terms
referring to--Ultimate causation

246
14:29
is the reason why something is
there in the first place,

247
14:32
over millions of years of
history.

248
14:35
Proximate causation is why
you're doing it now.

249
14:38
And these are different.
Obviously, for instance,

250
14:41
animals do all sorts of things
to help survive and reproduce

251
14:45
but a cockroach doesn't think
"oh,

252
14:47
I'm doing this to help survive
and reproduce and spread my

253
14:49
genes."
A cockroach doesn't know

254
14:51
anything about genes.
Rather, the mechanisms that

255
14:55
make it do what it does are
different from its own mental

256
14:59
states, if it has any--why it
does them.

257
15:03
This is a point nicely made by
William James.

258
15:05
So, William James is asked,
"Why do we eat?"

259
15:07
And he writes, 
Not one man in a billion

260
15:10
when taking his dinner ever
thinks of utility.

261
15:13
He eats because the food tastes
good and makes him want more.

262
15:16
If you asked him why you should
want to eat more of what tastes

263
15:18
like that, instead of revering
you as a philosopher,

264
15:20
he will probably laugh at you
for a fool.

265
15:23
And it's really the common
sense answer.

266
15:25
"Why are you eating?"
Nobody's going to answer,

267
15:28
"Because I must sustain my body
so as to spread my genes in the

268
15:31
future."
Rather, you eat because you're

269
15:34
hungry.
Those two theories,

270
15:36
you eat because you're hungry
and you eat to sustain your body

271
15:39
so you could spread your genes
in the future,

272
15:42
are not alternative.
Rather, they're different

273
15:45
levels of explanation.
And you can't confuse them.

274
15:49
The ultimate level which does
appeal to survival and

275
15:54
reproduction does not--is
independent from the

276
15:58
psychological level.
To give another example,

277
16:01
people protect their children
so you ask, "Why do people

278
16:05
protect their children?
Why would somebody devote so

279
16:08
much effort to protecting and
helping and feeding their

280
16:11
children?"
Well, the evolutionary

281
16:14
explanation is animals that
don't protect their offspring

282
16:17
don't last over evolutionary
time.

283
16:19
We protect our offspring
because they contain fifty

284
16:23
percent of our genes,
but that's not the

285
16:26
psychological explanation.
Nobody but a deranged

286
16:29
psychologist would ever answer,
"Oh, I love my children because

287
16:32
they contain fifty percent of my
genes."

288
16:35
Rather, the psychological
explanation is a deeper--is

289
16:38
different and has a different
texture.

290
16:41
And this will be a lot clearer
when we talk about the emotions,

291
16:45
where you could really see a
distinction between the question

292
16:48
of why we feel something from an
evolutionary point of view and

293
16:52
why we feel it from a day-to-day
point of view.

294
16:55
The second misconception is
that natural selection entails

295
16:59
that everything is adaptive,
that everything we do,

296
17:02
everything we think is
adaptive.

297
17:05
This is wrong.
Natural selection and

298
17:11
evolution, more generally,
distinguish between adaptations

299
17:15
and byproducts and accidents.
Many of you are currently,

300
17:19
or will as you get older,
suffer back pain.

301
17:23
If I was to ask you,
"So, why do you suffer back

302
17:26
pain?
How does back pain help you

303
17:29
survive and reproduce?"
Well, the answer is it's not an

304
17:32
adaptation.
Back pain is an accidental

305
17:35
byproduct of how our backs are
shaped.

306
17:37
Don't go looking for an
adaptive reason for hiccups or

307
17:42
self-pity or bloating after you
eat.

308
17:46
There's all sorts of things a
body will do that have no

309
17:50
adaptive value,
rather just accidents.

310
17:53
We have a body that does all
sorts of things.

311
17:55
Some things it will do by
accident and this is certainly

312
17:59
true for psychology.

313
18:00


314
18:04
So, a lot of the things,
for instance,

315
18:06
that occupy our interest or our
fascination in day-to-day life

316
18:11
are almost certainly
evolutionary accidents.

317
18:14
The number--The three--Three of
the main preoccupations of

318
18:18
humans are pornography,
television, and chocolate but

319
18:23
if I asked you,
"Why do you like porn?"

320
18:27
and you'd say,
"Because my ancestors who liked

321
18:30
porn reproduced more than those
who didn't," [laughter]

322
18:35
it's not true.
Rather, you like porn,

323
18:39
assuming you do,
[laughter]

324
18:42
as an accident.
You have evolved--For instance,

325
18:46
should you be a heterosexual
male, you have evolved to be

326
18:50
attracted to women.
That is most likely to be an

327
18:53
evolutionary adaptation because
being attracted to women and

328
18:57
wanting to have sex with women
is one step to the road to

329
19:00
having kids,
which is very good from an

330
19:02
evolutionary perspective.
It so happens,

331
19:05
though, in our modern
environment that people have

332
19:10
created images that substitute.
So, instead of actually going

333
19:15
out and seeking out women you
could just surf the web for

334
19:18
hours and hours and watch dirty
movies and read dirty books –

335
19:22
evolutionary adaptive dead ends.
They're accidents.

336
19:25
Why do you like chocolate bars,
assuming that you do?

337
19:28
It is not because your
ancestors in the African savanna

338
19:31
who enjoyed chocolate bars
reproduced more than those who

339
19:34
didn't.
Rather, it is because we've

340
19:37
evolved a taste for sweet
things.

341
19:39
And we've evolved a taste for
sweet things,

342
19:42
in part, because the sweet
things in our natural

343
19:44
environment like fruit were good
for us.

344
19:46
In the modern world we have
created things like chocolate,

345
19:50
which are not so good for us
but we eat anyway.

346
19:54
A lot of the debates--There's a
lot of controversy in psychology

347
19:58
over the scope of evolutionary
explanations.

348
20:01
And a lot of the debate tends
to be over what's an adaptation

349
20:07
and what isn't.
There are some clear cases.

350
20:11
We have color vision.
Why do we have color vision?

351
20:13
Well, I think everybody would
agree we have color vision as an

352
20:18
adaptation because of the
advantages it gives us for

353
20:21
seeing and making visual
distinctions.

354
20:24
We are afraid of snakes.
We're going to talk about that

355
20:29
in more detail but there's a
straightforward adaptive story

356
20:32
about that.
We are afraid of snakes

357
20:34
because, really,
our ancestors who weren't

358
20:36
afraid of snakes didn't
reproduce as much as those that

359
20:39
were.
We like chocolate bars and we

360
20:44
enjoy NASCAR.
Those cannot be adaptations

361
20:47
because chocolate bars and
NASCAR are recent developments

362
20:50
that could not have been
anticipated by evolution.

363
20:54
Those are easy questions.
Here are some hard questions.

364
20:56
Music.
Everywhere in the world people

365
21:00
like music.
Is this an adaptation for some

366
21:05
selective advantage or is it an
accident?

367
21:09
Steven Pinker,
who wrote The Language

368
21:11
Instinct that you read
before, caused a huge amount of

369
21:14
controversy when he argued that
music is just an evolutionary

370
21:17
accident.
He described it as auditory

371
21:19
cheesecake, something we like to
gorge ourselves on that have

372
21:23
no--has no adaptive advantage.
Other people argue music does

373
21:27
have an adaptive advantage.
Sometimes males use violence to

374
21:32
coerce sex.
Is male sexual violence a

375
21:35
biological adaptation or is it
an accident?

376
21:37
There's more than one language.
Is that just an accidental

377
21:41
byproduct of the way language
works or is there some sort of

378
21:45
group or selectionist advantage
sketched out in some way of

379
21:48
having multiple languages?
What about visual art?

380
21:51
What about fiction?
What about our love for stories?

381
21:54
Those are all matters of heated
debate.

382
21:57
And so, we have to keep in mind
some things plainly are

383
22:01
accidents.
Some things almost certainly

384
22:04
aren't accidents.
Where the action is in the

385
22:06
study of psychology and the
study of evolution of cognition

386
22:10
is trying to figure out which is
which.

387
22:13
So, those are the
misconceptions we have to avoid.

388
22:16
But still, who cares?
Again this is an Introduction

389
22:21
to Psych course.
Why are we talking about

390
22:23
evolution?
Why should it matter to a

391
22:25
psychologist how the mind has
evolved?

392
22:29
I'm going to talk about
evolution now but for the rest

393
22:32
of the course I'm just
interested in how our minds are,

394
22:35
period.
S,o why would evolution matter?

395
22:38
Well, many people think it
doesn't.

396
22:41
For instance – and they think
it doesn't for different reasons

397
22:46
– one claim is a metaphysical
one.

398
22:49
You might be a dualist.
You might reject the idea your

399
22:52
mental life is the product of
your brain and hence evolution

400
22:55
is irrelevant to psychology
because the brain and the

401
22:58
mind--because the brain,
which may have evolved,

402
23:01
has nothing interesting to do
with the mind.

403
23:03
Lisa Simpson got it wrong when
she said the Pope--She got it

404
23:08
half right when she said the
Pope favored evolution.

405
23:12
It is true.
John Paul II,

406
23:15
many years ago,
made a statement saying that

407
23:20
Darwinian theory is not
incompatible.

408
23:25
Darwinian theory is a view
about the evolution of species

409
23:29
that is not motivated by any
animus,

410
23:32
is a genuine scientific theory,
and should it turn out to be

411
23:36
true, it is not incompatible to
truth about man as taught by the

412
23:40
Church.
And scientists were thrilled by

413
23:43
this and they were--they said
he's endorsing evolution.

414
23:46
But what a fewer people talk
about is the fact that after he

415
23:50
said this he drew the line.
He allowed for evolution of the

416
23:54
body but he would not allow for
evolution of the mind.

417
23:57
So it was--he wrote: 
If the human body takes

418
24:00
its origin from preexisting
living matter,

419
24:03
the spiritual soul is
immediately created by God.

420
24:06
Consequently,
theories of evolution which

421
24:08
consider the mind as emerging
from the forces of living matter

422
24:11
or as a mere epiphenomenon of
this matter are incompatible to

423
24:13
the truth about man.
So, you might not want

424
24:17
evolution to be true about the
mind because you might believe

425
24:21
that the mind is not subject to
the same physical laws as the

426
24:25
rest of the physical world.
That's one way you could reject

427
24:29
evolutionary psychology.
Another way to reject

428
24:32
evolutionary psychology is to
accept that the mind is a

429
24:35
physical thing but then argue
that all of these instincts and

430
24:39
these hard-wired facets of human
nature might exist for other

431
24:42
animals but they don't exist for
people.

432
24:45
So, the anthropologist Ashley
Montagu in '73,

433
24:48
close to when The Six
Million Dollar Man was

434
24:51
shown, by the way,
said:

435
24:53
With the exception of the
reactions of infants to sudden

436
24:55
withdrawals of support and to
sudden loud noises,

437
24:57
the human being is entirely
instinctless.

438
25:00
Man is man because he has no
instincts, because everything he

439
25:03
is and has become he has learned
from his culture,

440
25:05
from the man-made part of the
environment, from other human

441
25:08
beings.
You might say, "Look.

442
25:12
He could believe that in '74
but, of course,

443
25:14
all of the infant studies that
have come out since then

444
25:17
suggested that's not true and
nobody would believe that

445
25:20
nowadays."
But in fact,

446
25:22
the view is often
hold--held--Louis Menand in a

447
25:24
New Yorker article a few
years ago wrote,

448
25:27
"Every aspect of life has a
biological foundation in exactly

449
25:31
the same sense,
which is that unless it was

450
25:33
biologically possible it
wouldn't exist.

451
25:35
After that it's up for grabs."
And this is in the context of

452
25:39
an argument that evolution can't
tell us anything about what's

453
25:42
most interesting about people.
Menand is not--is an educated,

454
25:47
intelligent scholar.
He is presumably well aware of

455
25:51
the findings of Spelke and
Baillargeon about how people are

456
25:54
hard-wired to understand the
objects in social life and so

457
25:58
on.
But his point is just that when

458
26:00
it comes to the more interesting
aspects of human nature,

459
26:03
the stuff we're naturally,
intuitively interested in,

460
26:06
that's more cultural.
And the evolutionary theory and

461
26:09
Darwinian theory just doesn't
have anything much to say about

462
26:12
it,
not because the mind is

463
26:14
separate from the brain but just
because humans are much more

464
26:18
cultural organisms,
and so biology has little to

465
26:22
say about it.
There's a third objection,

466
26:25
which is you might think,
"Okay, the human mind actually

467
26:29
does contain instincts.
There is a human nature but we

468
26:33
should just study it by studying
people.

469
26:36
How could evolution,
the study of evolution,

470
26:39
the consideration of evolution
tell us anything interesting?"

471
26:43
I actually, in my own work,
think evolution can tell us

472
26:47
some interesting things.
And I want to try to make a

473
26:51
case for ways in which evolution
can inform and enlighten us

474
26:56
about the mind as it is.
First, I want to make a point,

475
27:00
which is although this course
is Intro Psych and it is about

476
27:05
the mind as it is,
still I think by any account

477
27:08
the evolution of consciousness,
morality and so on,

478
27:11
just is intuitively interesting.
It's the sort of thing that

479
27:15
people are just fascinated by
and I think it's a question of

480
27:18
interest in and of its own
right.

481
27:21
But here's how it could tell us
about psychology.

482
27:24
For one thing,
it can tell us what can be

483
27:28
innate and what cannot.
So, some problems,

484
27:31
some evolutionary problems,
have been around for a long

485
27:35
time and could lead to special
biological adaptations.

486
27:39
If I told you there is a
biological adaptation for

487
27:43
talking, mate selection,
childcare;

488
27:45
maybe it's true,
maybe it isn't,

489
27:48
but it's not crazy.
From an evolutionary point of

490
27:52
view, it's a reasonable
possibility that it is.

491
27:55
Other problems are recent and
our brains could not be

492
27:59
specialized to deal with them:
written communication,

493
28:03
interacting with strangers,
driving a car,

494
28:06
playing chess.
If you were to argue that

495
28:08
there's a part of the brain
devoted to playing chess,

496
28:12
I would say you're utterly
wrong.

497
28:14
You cannot be right because,
from an evolutionary point of

498
28:17
view, there could be no such
part of the brain evolved

499
28:19
because playing chess is a
recent innovation.

500
28:22
As a result,
a focus on evolution could help

501
28:24
discipline us to make coherent
claims about what is built-in

502
28:28
and what isn't built-in.
Third, we're going to talk

503
28:32
about human differences in this
course.

504
28:36
We're going to devote a class
to human differences of the sort

505
28:39
of what makes you different from
her, different from her.

506
28:42
Why do we have different
intelligences in this class?

507
28:45
Why are some of us arrogant and
some of us humble?

508
28:48
Some of us like--attracted to
men, others attracted to women,

509
28:52
and so on.
But there's also questions of

510
28:55
group differences.
And evolutionary theory can

511
28:57
help us say intelligent things
about what sort of group

512
29:00
differences you should expect
because evolutionary theory

513
29:04
predicts that some populations
should evolve in different ways

514
29:07
than others.
The most obvious example is

515
29:11
that children should be
different from adults.

516
29:17
The evolutionary problems faced
by a child are very different

517
29:20
from the evolutionary problems
faced by an adult.

518
29:24
And you can make specific and
rather interesting predictions

519
29:27
about how children's brains
should different--differ from

520
29:30
adults' brains.
Evolutionary theory

521
29:32
predicts--does not make any
predictions about racial

522
29:37
differences or ethnic
differences.

523
29:40
Some might exist,
but there's no adaptive reason

524
29:42
why humans who have evolved in
different parts of the world

525
29:45
should have profound differences
in their mental capacities.

526
29:49
What does evolutionary theory
say about sex differences?

527
29:52
Well, it says some interesting
things, and we're going to

528
29:56
devote a class to discussing
them,

529
29:59
but what I think is going to be
true--proved to be important is

530
30:03
that we'll be able to use
evolutionary biology to talk

531
30:08
sensibly about what sort of
distinctions between the sexes,

532
30:13
between males and females,
one would expect to find and

533
30:16
what sort one wouldn't expect to
find.

534
30:19
We can make educated
predictions.

535
30:21
I'm going to have--I want to
put here a clip of a man.

536
30:25
This is a scene from a movie,
the movie "Roger Dodger," that

537
30:28
begins with a man making
quasi-evolutionary claims about

538
30:31
the differences between men and
women.

539
30:33
And I want to put this as an
example of what you could call

540
30:37
"barroom evolutionary
psychology."

541
30:39
And I want us to hold this in
our minds because we're going to

542
30:44
return to these claims and
discuss their validity.

543
30:48
I like this for a few reasons.
First, I like the backward

544
30:51
reference to William James and
utility.

545
30:53
Second, it is a gorgeous
combination of some things that

546
30:58
are actually reasonably rational
and total bull crap.

547
31:02
And--but what evolutionary
biology will give us is the

548
31:06
tools to distinguish between the
two.

549
31:09
On the face of it immediately,
the ability to read maps,

550
31:12
the claim that that has a
biological--that differences in

551
31:15
that ability have a biological
root is crazy.

552
31:18
On the other hand,
the claim that one--that males

553
31:21
may develop a trait not because
it's advantageous but to attract

554
31:26
females is less crazy.
The telepathic stuff is really

555
31:29
crazy but--;So,
I'm not at this point--We're

556
31:33
going to devote a lecture to
sex.

557
31:35
I do not, at this point,
want to make any claims one way

558
31:37
or another.
But what I want to suggest is

559
31:39
that from a biological point of
view we could say sensible and

560
31:43
intelligent things about what
differences should exist and

561
31:46
what shouldn't.
Finally, and most of all,

562
31:49
looking at something from the
perspective of design,

563
31:52
the perspective of what's it
for, can often give you

564
31:55
interesting insights as to its
current nature.

565
31:58
And I'll give you two quick
examples, one that's not from

566
32:01
psychology, one that is.
Women suffer--Often women who

567
32:05
are pregnant early in their
pregnancy suffer from morning

568
32:10
sickness, nausea,
throwing up and so on.

569
32:13
This has traditionally been
viewed as just a breakdown in

570
32:16
the system--too much hormones,
everything's askew;

571
32:19
women get nauseous.
Margie Profet suggested an

572
32:23
alternative and this won her the
MacArthur Genius Award.

573
32:27
And this was the claim that
maybe pregnancy sickness is not

574
32:30
an accident;
rather, it's designed,

575
32:33
it has a biological purpose.
In particular,

576
32:36
as the baby develops in the
uterus, it is vulnerable to

577
32:42
various sorts of poisons or
teratogens.

578
32:46
Profet suggested that pregnancy
sickness is a hypersensitive

579
32:51
period where women are extremely
sensitive,

580
32:55
get extremely nauseous towards
the sorts of foods that could

581
32:59
damage their baby.
Now, if she just ended there

582
33:03
it's a story.
How do we know it's true?

583
33:06
But then she went on to examine
it the same way that any

584
33:09
scientist examines any claim –
by making predictions and

585
33:13
testing them.
And this makes some interesting

586
33:15
predictions.
It suggests the timing of onset

587
33:18
and offset of pregnancy
sickness, of morning sickness,

588
33:21
should correspond to the period
of maximal vulnerability on the

589
33:25
part of the developing embryo or
fetus.

590
33:28
Suggested the types of foods
avoided should correspond to

591
33:32
those sorts of foods that were
most deadly for the fetus and

592
33:36
that were deadly for the fetus
during the periods where humans

593
33:40
evolved.
This last qualification is an

594
33:43
important one.
Women do not develop an

595
33:46
aversion to alcohol during
pregnancy even though alcohol is

596
33:50
extremely dangerous to the
developing child.

597
33:54
The answer is an easy one.
Alcohol wasn't around during

598
33:58
our evolutionary history and we
could not have evolved a system

599
34:01
to protect ourselves from it.
And finally,

600
34:04
there should be a relationship
between miscarriage and birth

601
34:08
defects in a surprising
direction.

602
34:10
For Profet, and she has
evidence to back this up,

603
34:13
pregnancy sickness is not a
glitch in the system.

604
34:17
Rather, it's the sign of a
healthy act of protective

605
34:20
mechanism going on.
And in fact,

606
34:23
the more morning sickness the
more the baby should be

607
34:25
protected.
Something which,

608
34:27
by and large,
appears to be true.

609
34:29
That's an example of how the
question--when dealing with this

610
34:32
they say, "Hey.
Women throw up when they get

611
34:34
pregnant" and then say,
"Look.

612
34:36
Maybe that's not just a glitch.
What's it for?"

613
34:40
You could then learn some
interesting things.

614
34:43
Here's a different example
based on the last lecture,

615
34:47
this wonderful lecture by Peter
Salovey on sex and love where he

616
34:52
talked about the "big three."
These are the "big three" to

617
34:56
remind you of what attracts us
to somebody else.

618
34:59
You are very attracted to the
person next to you or a person

619
35:03
that--because of proximity,
similarity, familiarity.

620
35:07
And there is abundant evidence
supporting the truth of this.

621
35:11
It's almost always true but the
evolutionary psychologist looks

622
35:16
at this and says there's
something seriously wrong here.

623
35:20
There are some cases where that
has to be totally,

624
35:24
absolutely mistaken.
To realize what this is,

625
35:28
think for a moment.
What humans are you most close

626
35:34
to, most similar to and most
familiar with?

627
35:39
What humans did you spend over
ten years of your life with who

628
35:44
are genetically and
environmentally as close to you

629
35:48
as if they were related,
who you are intimately familiar

630
35:52
with?
Are those the humans that you

631
35:56
find the hottest?
[laughter] No.

632
35:59
They're your siblings and they
are not hot.

633
36:07
[laughter]
I was on Google Images this

634
36:09
morning.
I put up some hot siblings

635
36:13
and--but--although we may find
them hot, they do not typically,

636
36:20
with some rare and bizarre
exceptions, find [laughter]

637
36:23
one another hot.
Why not?

638
36:27
Well, this is not a huge puzzle
from the standpoint of

639
36:32
evolutionary biology.
Evolutionary biology posits

640
36:35
that humans, as well as other
animals, should have incest

641
36:39
avoidance.
We should love--we should be

642
36:41
attracted to those familiar to
us, similar to us,

643
36:45
close to us,
but not kin.

644
36:46
Kin are off limits.
There is a good reason why.

645
36:50
Because if you inter-mate with
your kin you have bad offspring

646
36:56
[laughter]
and so animals should be wired

647
37:00
up not to mate with their kin.
And in fact,

648
37:04
this is what happens.
There are--Parents of teenagers

649
37:09
have all sorts of concerns.
And a lot of the concerns are,

650
37:13
in fact, sexual.
How do you keep your son and/or

651
37:16
your daughter from going out and
having sex with too many people,

652
37:19
or the wrong people,
or unprotected sex?

653
37:21
But there are no parenting
guides in the world that say

654
37:24
"How do you keep your children
from having sex with one

655
37:28
another?"
[laughter]

656
37:29
You typically do not need to
because they do not want to have

657
37:33
sex with one another.
Now, this is--actually also

658
37:36
illustrates the difference
between proximate and ultimate

659
37:40
causation.
So, you think for yourself,

660
37:43
"Eew.
Do I want to have sex with my

661
37:45
sister?"
You don't think to yourself,

662
37:47
"I would prefer not to,
for the offspring that we will

663
37:50
create will be nonviable and
it'll be a waste of my

664
37:52
reproductive efforts."
Rather, you think,

665
37:55
"Eew," because at a gut level
you respond.

666
37:59
And this sort of instinctive
response is what you get from an

667
38:03
evolutionary analysis of sex.
But this story is deeply

668
38:08
incomplete because the question
that gets raised is "how do you

669
38:13
tell?"
You don't want to have sex with

670
38:16
your kin but how do you tell
your kin?

671
38:19
People don't carry their DNA
markers on strips that you could

672
38:23
see.
How do you tell who your kin

673
38:26
are?
And this actually turns out to

674
38:28
be a really interesting
question.

675
38:30
It used--And some research
suggests that the answer is

676
38:34
simple.
You avoid sex with people you

677
38:37
grew up with.
And these studies actually come

678
38:40
from kibbutz studies,
studies where people are raised

679
38:44
communally on an Israeli
kibbutz.

680
38:46
They know they're not related,
but still, the fact that they

681
38:50
were raised together as kids
suggests that there's a cue at a

682
38:55
gut level not to be attracted to
one another.

683
38:58
It turns out there's some
reason now to believe this story

684
39:02
is incomplete.
A paper that came out in

685
39:04
Nature five days ago
reported a series of extremely

686
39:08
interesting studies.
And they found that the cue of

687
39:12
being raised together as a child
with somebody--yes,

688
39:16
that does diminish sexual
desire, but an even bigger cue

689
39:20
was "did you observe your
parents,

690
39:23
and in particular,
your mother,

691
39:25
taking care of that person?"
If you did, that seriously

692
39:28
diminishes sexual desire and
brings it down to the level of

693
39:33
disgust.
And again, these are the sort

694
39:36
of questions and issues you
begin to ask when you approach

695
39:40
things from an evolutionary
perspective.

696
39:44
Okay.

697
39:45


698
39:48
For this lecture--the rest of
this lecture and then the next

699
39:52
couple of lectures,
I'll be discussing some basic

700
39:55
aspects of human nature that
are, to some extent or another,

701
39:58
informed by evolutionary theory.
And what I want to start for

702
40:03
the remainder of this lecture is
a discussion of rationality.

703
40:09
Now, some of you maybe not want
to go into--not want to go into

704
40:13
psychology because there's no
Nobel Prize for psychology.

705
40:18
You might all think,
"Hey, if I'm going to go into

706
40:20
the sciences I want a Nobel
Prize.

707
40:22
Think how proud Bubby and Zadie
would be if I won a Nobel Prize.

708
40:26
Wouldn't that be the best?"
You can get one.

709
40:32
Psychologists have won the
Nobel Prize.

710
40:35
Most recently,
Danny Kahneman won a Nobel

711
40:37
Prize.
You win it in economics,

712
40:39
sometimes medicine;
not a big deal.

713
40:42
He won it for his work done
over the course of many decades

714
40:48
on human rationality.
And this work was done in

715
40:51
collaboration with Amos Tversky,
who passed away several years

716
40:56
ago.
And this work entirely

717
40:59
transformed the way we think
about human decision-making and

718
41:05
rationality.
Kahneman and Tversky caused a

719
41:08
revolution in economics,
psychology, and the social

720
41:11
sciences more generally,
by causing us to shift from the

721
41:15
idea that we're logical
thinkers, who think in accord

722
41:18
with the axioms of logic and
mathematics and rationality,

723
41:23
more towards the idea that we
actually have sort of rough and

724
41:27
ready heuristics.
These heuristics served us well

725
41:30
during the time--during our
evolutionary history,

726
41:34
but sometimes they can lead us
astray.

727
41:36
And I want to give some
examples of these heuristics.

728
41:40
And I'll give four examples of
heuristics that are argued to

729
41:45
permeate our reasoning.
The first is "framing effects."

730
41:49
This was a classic study by
Kahneman and Tversky involving

731
41:54
this sort of question.
The U.S.

732
41:56
is preparing for the outbreak
of a disease that's going to

733
41:59
kill six hundred people.
There are two programs.

734
42:02
Program A: If you follow it two
hundred people will be saved.

735
42:05
Program B: There's a one-third
chance everybody will be saved

736
42:10
and a two-third chance nobody
will be saved.

737
42:13
Who would choose program B?

738
42:14


739
42:18
Who would choose program A?
Okay.

740
42:21
And that fits the responses.
Most people choose program A.

741
42:26
That's--It could go either way.
What's interesting is if you

742
42:30
frame the question differently,
like this, you get very

743
42:34
different responses.
And instead of focusing on the

744
42:37
people who will be saved,
you focus on the people who

745
42:40
will die and,
instead of focusing on the

746
42:41
chance that nobody will die and
the chance that everybody will

747
42:44
die,
you'd flip it around,

748
42:46
you get a corresponding flip.
And this is known as a "framing

749
42:50
effect."
The idea of a framing effect is

750
42:53
that you could respond
differently to a situation

751
42:57
depending on how the options are
framed.

752
43:01
And, in particular,
this combines with "loss

753
43:04
aversion."
People hate a certain loss.

754
43:08
"Four thousand of these people
will die" is extremely aversive

755
43:12
and so the framing can influence
your decisions.

756
43:16
And clever advertisers and
clever decision makers will

757
43:20
frame things in different ways
to give you--give rise to

758
43:24
different intuitions.
Sometimes this could be fairly

759
43:27
simple.
So, you have this ad of a

760
43:29
hamburger that's eighty percent
fat free versus twenty percent

761
43:34
fat--You don't have to be a
brilliant ad executive to figure

762
43:39
out which one to go for.
It turns out that this sort of

763
43:44
fundamental act – the
fundamental role of framing

764
43:49
effects – is not limited to
humans.

765
43:53
So, I want to take a second and
tell you some work done by my

766
43:57
colleague, Laurie Santos,
with capuchin monkeys.

767
44:00
And what she does is she takes
these capuchin monkeys and she

768
44:05
teaches them to use money.
She teaches them to use little

769
44:09
discs to buy themselves either
pieces of banana or pieces of

770
44:14
apple.
And they like to eat this.

771
44:16
And they very quickly learn you
can hand over a disc to get some

772
44:19
banana or some apple.

773
44:21


774
44:40
[laughter]
Now, Dr.

775
44:41
Santos and her colleagues have
done many studies using this

776
44:45
method, but the study I'm
interested in illustrating here

777
44:48
shows framing effects in these
nonhuman primates.

778
44:51
So, what she does is--There's
two options.

779
44:54
In one option,
the experimenter shows one

780
44:58
object to the capuchin and
low--and then either gives one

781
45:03
or two--half the time gives one,
half the time gives two,

782
45:08
for an average of one and a
half.

783
45:11
The other experimenter does
exactly the same thing;

784
45:15
gives one or two for an average
of one and a half,

785
45:17
but starts off displaying two.
Now, if you weren't a human,

786
45:21
how would you feel about these
two experimenters?

787
45:24
They both give you the same
amount.

788
45:26
And capuchins are extremely
sensitive to how much they get,

789
45:29
but it turns out as predicted
they don't like the pink

790
45:32
experimenter because the pink
experimenter is--he gives you

791
45:36
two--shows you two and half the
time he gives you one.

792
45:39
This guy shows you one,
and half the time gives you

793
45:43
two.
And over time they develop a

794
45:46
preference for the experimenter
that shows them one initially,

795
45:51
suggesting that they are being
subject to framing effects or

796
45:55
choices relative to a reference
point.

797
45:57
A different sort of
demonstration is the "endowment

798
46:01
effect."
This is a robust and very

799
46:03
interesting effect.
Here's the idea.

800
46:07
I show you something like a cup
or a chocolate bar and I say,

801
46:11
"How much will you give me for
this chocolate bar?

802
46:15
It looks like you're pretty
hungry.

803
46:16
How much will you give me for
this chocolate bar?"

804
46:18
And you say,
"I'll give you two dollars for

805
46:20
this chocolate bar."
Most people on average give

806
46:23
two--the chocolate bar--gives
two dollars for a chocolate bar.

807
46:26
The other condition's exactly
the same except I hand you a

808
46:29
chocolate bar and say,
"How much money will you sell

809
46:32
me that chocolate bar for?"
There, people say,

810
46:35
"Two fifty," and in fact,
what happens is once you own

811
46:41
something its value shoots up.
And this has mystified

812
46:46
economists and psychologists.
It makes no sense.

813
46:49
The chocolate bar doesn't even
have to move.

814
46:51
I just leave it on the table
and say either "How much will

815
46:54
you spend," "How much will you
give me for this?"

816
46:56
or "Okay.
It's yours.

817
46:58
How much do you want for me to
take it back?"

818
47:00
The answer is, it's framing.
If you're asking how much you

819
47:05
want for it, it's a game.
It's just how much will you pay

820
47:08
to get something.
But if you're being asked how

821
47:12
much do you want for me to take
it from you, you treat it as a

822
47:16
loss.
And as a loss it becomes more

823
47:19
valuable.
Those are framing effects.

824
47:23
The second example is base
rates.

825
47:25
There are seventy
lawyers--sorry,

826
47:28
seventy engineers and thirty
lawyers and John is chosen at

827
47:34
random.
Let me tell you about John:

828
47:36
forty-years old,
married, three children,

829
47:39
conservative,
cautious, no interest in

830
47:41
politics, awkward around people.
His hobbies include carpentry,

831
47:45
sailing, and solving
mathematical puzzles,

832
47:48
like online dating.

833
47:49


834
47:53
[laughter]
What do you think John is?

835
47:54
A lawyer or an engineer?
Who thinks he's a lawyer?

836
47:57
Good.
Who thinks he's an engineer?

837
48:02
Okay.
Most people think he's an

838
48:04
engineer, but here's the thing.
You switch it.

839
48:07
Right?
Thirty engineers,

840
48:08
seventy lawyers?
It doesn't change.

841
48:11
People--No matter what this
number is--these numbers--it

842
48:14
doesn't seem to change who you
think he is or how confident you

843
48:18
are.
People look at John as an

844
48:20
individual and they ignore the
background status of where he

845
48:24
came from.
They ignore base rates.

846
48:27
Base rates are very difficult
to think about and I want to

847
48:31
give you an example of this.
And the example will be on the

848
48:36
slides for when you print them
out--print it out because you

849
48:40
might want to work through it
yourself.

850
48:43
But I'll give this to you
quickly.

851
48:44
There's a disease that hits one
in a thousand people,

852
48:47
a pretty common disease.
There's a test for the disease

853
48:50
and if you have it,
it's going to tell you you have

854
48:53
it.
It tests for a certain thing in

855
48:55
your blood and "boom," if the
thing is in your blood the test

856
48:58
will go "boom."
If you have it,

857
49:00
it will tell you you have it.
It doesn't miss.

858
49:04
On the other hand,
it's not perfect.

859
49:06
It has a false positive rate of
five percent.

860
49:08
So, if you don't have the
disease, five percent of the

861
49:11
time the test will say you have
it.

862
49:13
So, if the test says you don't
have it, you're fine.

863
49:18
But if the test says you have
it, maybe you have it but maybe

864
49:21
it's a false positive.
You take the test.

865
49:25
It says you have the disease.
Without pen and paper,

866
49:28
how likely do you think the
odds are you have the disease?

867
49:33


868
49:36
Who says over fifty percent?
Okay.

869
49:41
Before people sinisterly
shouted the right answer,

870
49:44
people will tend--medical
students were given this,

871
49:47
medical students less savvy
than you, and the average is

872
49:51
between fifty percent and
ninety-five percent.

873
49:54
The answer is,
as some people quickly noted,

874
49:57
two percent.
And here's how it works.

875
50:02
One percent of a thousand will
have the disease.

876
50:04
That person will test positive.
The test never misses.

877
50:07
That leaves nine hundred
ninety-nine people who don't

878
50:09
have the disease,
and we'll say about fifty

879
50:10
percent of these people have it.
So, for every fifty-one people

880
50:14
who test positive,
only one will have the disease,

881
50:17
giving an average of about two
percent.

882
50:19
This sort of thing is very
difficult.

883
50:22
Our minds are not evolved to do
base rate computation.

884
50:26
And so, any problems involving
base rate computation,

885
50:29
including real world problems,
like what to do when you come

886
50:33
back with a positive test,
we screw up.

887
50:36
And often we screw up in the
direction of panic.

888
50:39
The third bias is the
"availability bias."

889
50:42
And this is simply that if you
want to know how frequent

890
50:45
something is,
how available it is to come to

891
50:48
mind is an excellent cue.
But this could lead to mistakes.

892
50:53
A classic example by Kahneman
and Tversky is you ask

893
50:57
people--one group of people how
many English words end with "ng"

894
51:01
or what proportion of English
words,

895
51:04
another group of people what
proportion end with "ing."

896
51:09
It turns out you get much
bigger numbers for "ing" than

897
51:13
"ng" though, of course "ng" has
to--"ing"--sorry,

898
51:17
"ng" would include everything
with "ing."

899
51:20
It's just a lot easier to think
about these things.

900
51:25
This can show up in the real
world.

901
51:28
What are your risk of getting
killed--What's your risk of

902
51:30
getting killed by a shark?
Well, if you ask people what

903
51:34
their risk of getting killed by
a shark is, they

904
51:38
characteristically overestimate
it.

905
51:41
I will give you the news of
what the risk is for getting

906
51:44
killed by a shark.
Injured in any given year:

907
51:48
one in six million.
Killed: one in five hundred

908
51:52
million.
If you live in Florida,

909
51:54
which apparently is Shark
Central, your chance of getting

910
51:58
injured is about one in a half
million.

911
52:00
People will overestimate the
risks because shark attacks are

912
52:05
very salient.
They are always reported in the

913
52:08
news and they're very
interesting.

914
52:09
What is the chance of getting
killed by potato salad?

915
52:13
[laughter]
Well, food poisoning,

916
52:15
death by food poisoning,
injury by food poisoning runs

917
52:19
to about one in fifty-five,
one in 800 for some sort of

918
52:24
injury and one in 55,000 killed.
Potato salad is 1,000 more

919
52:31
times more dangerous than shark
attacks.

920
52:37
But you get it wrong because
you don't think,

921
52:39
"Oh, my God,
big news story.

922
52:41
Somebody dies by potato salad."
[laughter]

923
52:45
And so, we tend to overestimate
the chance of being killed by

924
52:50
dramatic effects.
How many Jews in the United

925
52:53
States, what proportion?
Who thinks it's over three

926
52:57
quarters of the United States is
Jewish?

927
53:00
[laughter]
I'm kind of anchoring here.

928
53:01
Okay.
Okay.

929
53:02
Who thinks over half?
Who thinks over forty percent?

930
53:09
Who thinks over twenty percent?
Okay.

931
53:12
Who thinks over fifteen percent?
Who thinks over ten percent?

932
53:17
Who thinks over seven and
one-half percent?

933
53:21
Who thinks over five percent?
Okay.

934
53:24
Who thinks overall there's more
than five percent of the United

935
53:27
States that's Jewish?

936
53:28


937
53:31
Who thinks over three percent?
The answer is somewhere between

938
53:38
1.9 and 2.1%.
Most people think--The average

939
53:42
American thinks it's twenty
percent.

940
53:45
There is-- [laughter]
If you're curious about

941
53:48
demographics,
and this map isn't to be

942
53:51
entirely trusted because I got
it from Wikipedia,

943
53:54
[laughter]
this is the distribution of the

944
53:57
Jewish population,
self-identified as Jewish in

945
53:59
different parts of the United
States.

946
54:02
[laughter]
New York City is,

947
54:04
of course, the most dense
population with nine percent.

948
54:08
New Haven has 3.5%.

949
54:14


950
54:19
Now, why do people get it wrong?
Well, there's all sorts of

951
54:24
reasons and this is going to
come out in the context of

952
54:26
social psychology when we talk
about how people think about

953
54:29
human groups.
But one quick answer is people

954
54:33
who are plainly Jewish are
prominent in positions where

955
54:38
people notice them,
like entertainment or,

956
54:42
in the case of you guys,
academia.

957
54:45
And this could lead to--this
availability-- "Can I think of a

958
54:48
Jew?
Yeah."

959
54:52
[laughter]
This availability causes us to

960
54:55
overestimate the proportion to
which Jews are represented in

961
54:59
the population.
Final example.

962
55:03
Confirmation bias.
This is a very nice study and

963
55:07
it's very simple.
It's--You're in a jury of a

964
55:11
custody case.
You have to give a child

965
55:14
custody – either a mother or
father sole custody.

966
55:18
One parent has average income,
average health,

967
55:20
average working hours,
reasonable rapport with the

968
55:23
child, and a relatively stable
social life.

969
55:25
The second parent has an
above-average income,

970
55:28
minor health problems,
lots of work-related travel,

971
55:31
a very close relationship with
the travel--with the child,

972
55:33
and an extremely active social
life.

973
55:35
Think for a moment.
Who would you award custody

974
55:37
with?
There's no--Obviously,

975
55:38
there's no right answer here.
Just think for a moment.

976
55:42
Who would award custody to
parent A?

977
55:45
Who would award custody to
parent B?

978
55:49
Okay.
As I think there is in this

979
55:52
room, when this study is done
there's a slight advantage to

980
55:58
parent B.
Here's what's interesting.

981
56:01
You give another group of
people this question.

982
56:04
"Which parent would you deny
custody to?"

983
56:07
You get a slight advantage for
parent B.

984
56:11
Now, this is to some extent an
illustration of framing problem

985
56:14
but it's also a more general
illustration of the confirmation

986
56:17
bias.
So, when you're asked to award

987
56:19
custody to, you then ask,
"Well, what is a good--what is

988
56:22
a sign that somebody's a good
parent?"

989
56:25
And the good parent aspects of
B jump out.

990
56:28
When asking about denying
custody you ask,

991
56:30
"Where is a cue that somebody's
a bad parent?"

992
56:32
And the bad parent aspects of B
jump out.

993
56:37
In general, when we have a
hypothesis we look for

994
56:40
confirmations.
This makes some things,

995
56:42
which are logically easy
extremely difficult problems

996
56:46
when we face them in the real
world.

997
56:49
And I'll end with my final
example, that of the Wason

998
56:52
selection task.
Here's the game.

999
56:55
And people--I don't want people
to shout it out just yet.

1000
56:59
There is four cards.
Each card has a letter on one

1001
57:03
side and a number on the other
side.

1002
57:07
You have to judge whether this
claim is true or false.

1003
57:12
"If a card has a 'D' on one
side, it has a '3' on the other

1004
57:17
side."
How many cards do you have to

1005
57:20
turn over to test whether that
rule is right?

1006
57:24
Okay.
Somebody shout out what one

1007
57:27
card is you have to turn over.
"D."

1008
57:30
Everybody gets that right.
What else?

1009
57:33
Do you need to do any other
cards?

1010
57:34


1011
57:39
How many people think it's "D"
and "3"?

1012
57:42
I'm raising my hand to fool you.
[laughter]

1013
57:46
People answer either "D" or "D"
and "3" but think about it.

1014
57:52
What would make this rule wrong?
It's wrong if it has "D" on one

1015
57:56
side and not "3" on the other.
Right?

1016
57:58
That's what it would be to be
wrong.

1017
58:00
You then would have to check
"D" to see if there is a "3" on

1018
58:03
the other side.
You were all right about that.

1019
58:05
That means you'd check "8" to
see if there's a "D" on the

1020
58:08
other side.
"Three's" not going to tell you

1021
58:11
anything.
That's hard.

1022
58:14
People find this very hard.
Okay.

1023
58:17
Big deal.
But what's interesting is you

1024
58:19
can modify it in certain ways to
make it a lot easier.

1025
58:23
And this is the work of Leda
Cosmides and her colleague,

1026
58:26
an evolutionary psychologist at
Santa Barbara who has argued

1027
58:29
that if you frame these
questions in ways that make

1028
58:32
ecological sense,
people are much better at them.

1029
58:35
And basically,
she does studies where she has

1030
58:38
people who are evaluating a
social rule.

1031
58:41
Imagine these cards.
On one side of the card is an

1032
58:46
alcohol--is a drink.
On the other side is a person's

1033
58:51
age.
You are a bartender and you

1034
58:53
want to make sure nobody under
twenty-one drinks beer.

1035
58:56
Which cards do you turn over?
Well, now it's easier but the

1036
59:02
logic is the same.
It's a violation that there's

1037
59:05
"under twenty-one" on one side,
"beer" on the other side,

1038
59:08
so you need to check the "under
twenty-one" here and you need to

1039
59:12
check the "beer" here.
And when you make these logical

1040
59:16
problems more ecologically valid
they turn out to be much easier.

1041
59:22
Okay.

1042
59:23


1043
59:29
There's a little bit more but
I'll hold it off until next

1044
59:33
class.
And I'll end with the reading

1045
59:36
response, which is to do your
own bit of reverse engineering

1046
59:41
and evolutionary psychology.
And I'll see you all on

1047
59:47
Wednesday.
