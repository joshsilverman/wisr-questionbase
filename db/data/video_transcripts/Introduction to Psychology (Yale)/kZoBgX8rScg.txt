Professor Paul Bloom:
I'm delighted to introduce the

2
0:16
first guest lecturer for this
Introduction to Psychology

3
0:21
course, Dean Peter Salovey.
Peter is an old friend and

4
0:25
colleague.
Many of you--I think everybody

5
0:27
here knows of him through his
role as Dean of Yale College.

6
0:31
I'll just, in this context of
this introduction,

7
0:34
mention two other things about
him.

8
0:36
One is prior to being dean and
in fact, still as a dean,

9
0:39
he's an active scientist and in
particular,

10
0:43
a social psychologist actively
involved in studying health

11
0:47
psychology, the proper use of
psychological methods to frame

12
0:51
health messages,
and also is the founder and

13
0:54
developer of the idea of
emotional intelligence,

14
0:57
an idea he's done a huge amount
of research on.

15
1:00
Secondly, Peter is or was an
active and extremely well-known

16
1:04
teacher at Yale College.
He taught at one point,

17
1:08
the largest course ever in Yale
College – a course on

18
1:12
Psychology in Law which broke
every record ever had here.

19
1:16
And before that,
during that,

20
1:18
and after that,
he was a legendary Introduction

21
1:21
to Psychology teacher.
And I think--and he had some

22
1:25
reason for why he was so
legendary with his lecture today

23
1:28
on the topic of love.

24
1:29


25
1:42
[applause]
Dean Peter Salovey:

26
1:43
Thanks very much.

27
1:44


28
2:03
Okay.
Thank you very much,

29
2:05
Professor Bloom.
It really is a pleasure to come

30
2:08
and lecture to you today on
Valentine's Day on the topic of

31
2:12
love.
My main area of research is

32
2:15
human emotion.
And love is an emotion.

33
2:19
It's not one that I study
personally, at least not in the

34
2:23
lab, and--but it is fun to talk
about.

35
2:26
And it is a topic that lends
itself to many social

36
2:30
psychological phenomena.
It's also great to be able to

37
2:33
come in and guest lecture.
One of the things I very much

38
2:37
miss since serving as dean is
the opportunity to teach

39
2:41
Psychology 110.
And although I love being dean,

40
2:44
I do miss teaching Introductory
Psychology, the feeling of

41
2:49
exposing people to ideas that
maybe you hadn't heard before.

42
2:53
Well, I suspect some of the
ideas in this talk you'll have

43
2:57
not heard before and for a
variety of reasons.

44
2:59
A couple of the things you'll
notice is that some of the

45
3:02
experiments I'll talk about
today are not the kinds of

46
3:05
experiments that can be done
anymore.

47
3:07
They're not considered
ethically acceptable but they

48
3:11
were done in the ‘50s and
‘60s and early ‘70s when

49
3:16
ethical standards were different
and so we can teach them.

50
3:21
We just can't give you the same
experiences that some of the

51
3:24
college students that we'll talk
about today in these studies

52
3:27
had.
The other thing I will mention

53
3:31
is that there is a certain
androcentric and heterosexual

54
3:35
quality to much of the social
psychological research on

55
3:40
romantic love.
You'll see that in the

56
3:43
experiments.
Usually, the participants are

57
3:47
men and usually the targets are
women in these experiments.

58
3:51
I'm not endorsing this as the
only way to study love.

59
3:55
It just happens to be the way
these experiments were done and

60
3:58
so I mention this caution right
from the beginning.

61
4:02
We'll have to think about--One
of the things you should think

62
4:06
about is do you think these
experiments generalized to other

63
4:10
kinds of dyadic relationships.
And that's a question that I

64
4:15
think you can ask throughout
this lecture.

65
4:18
Okay.
So let's get started.

66
4:21
And to start things off I think
what we need to do is consider a

67
4:28
definition.
I'm going to define what love

68
4:32
is but then most of the
experiments I'm going to talk

69
4:36
about are really focused more on
attraction than love--who finds

70
4:41
each other of romantic interest
that might then develop into a

71
4:46
love relationship.
But let's start with a

72
4:49
definition of love.
And I'm going to pick a

73
4:51
definition from a former
colleague, Robert Sternberg,

74
4:56
who is now the dean at Tufts
University but was here on our

75
5:01
faculty at Yale for nearly
thirty years or so.

76
5:05
And he has a theory of love
that argues that it's made up of

77
5:09
three components:
intimacy,

78
5:12
passion, and commitment,
or what is sometimes called

79
5:16
decision commitment.
And these are relatively

80
5:20
straightforward.
He argued that you don't have

81
5:23
love if you don't have all three
of these elements.

82
5:27
Intimacy is the feeling of
closeness, of connectedness with

83
5:32
someone, of bonding.
Operationally,

84
5:35
you could think of intimacy as
you share secrets,

85
5:38
you share information with this
person that you don't share with

86
5:43
anybody else.
Okay.

87
5:45
That's really what intimacy is,
the bond that comes from

88
5:49
sharing information that isn't
shared with other--with many

89
5:53
other people.
Second element is passion.

90
5:58
Passion is what you think it is.
Passion is the--we would say

91
6:04
the drive that leads to romance.
You can think of it as physical

92
6:09
attraction or sex.
And Sternberg argues that this

93
6:15
is a required component of a
love relationship.

94
6:21
It is not, however,
a required component of taking

95
6:24
a shower in Calhoun College.
[laughter]

96
6:27
The third element of love in
Sternberg's theory is what he

97
6:34
calls decision or commitment,
the decision that one is in a

98
6:41
love relationship,
the willingness to label it as

99
6:45
such,
and a commitment to maintain

100
6:48
that relationship at least for
some period of time.

101
6:52
Sternberg would argue it's not
love if you don't call it love

102
6:55
and if you don't have some
desire to maintain the

103
6:58
relationship.
So if you have all three of

104
7:02
these, intimacy,
passion and commitment,

105
7:05
in Sternberg's theory you have
love.

106
7:09
Now what's interesting about
the theory is what do you have

107
7:14
if you only have one out of
three or two out of three?

108
7:19
What do you have and how is it
different if you have a

109
7:23
different two out of three?
These are--What's interesting

110
7:27
about this kind of theorizing is
it give--it gives rise to many

111
7:31
different permutations that when
you break them down and start to

112
7:36
look at them carefully can be
quite interesting.

113
7:40
So what I've done is I've taken
Sternberg's three elements of

114
7:44
love, intimacy,
passion and commitment,

115
7:47
and I've listed out the
different kinds of relationships

116
7:52
one would have if you had zero,
one, two or three out of the

117
7:57
three elements.
And I'm using names or types

118
8:01
that Sternberg uses in his
theory.

119
8:03
These are really from him.
Some of these are pretty

120
8:07
obvious.
If you don't have intimacy,

121
8:09
if you don't have passion,
if you don't have commitment,

122
8:12
you don't have love.
Sternberg calls this non-love.

123
8:16
That's the technical term.
And [laughs]

124
8:19
essentially what he's saying is
the relationship you now have to

125
8:22
the person sitting next to you,
presuming that you're sitting

126
8:26
next to a random person that you
didn't know from your college,

127
8:30
is probably non-love.
If it's something else,

128
8:34
we could talk about it at the
end of the lecture or perhaps

129
8:38
when I get to it in a moment.
Now let's start to add elements.

130
8:43
Let's add intimacy.
This is sharing secrets,

131
8:48
a feeling of closeness,
connectedness,

132
8:52
bonding.
Let's say we have that with

133
8:55
someone but we don't have
passion, that is,

134
8:57
no sexual arousal,
and no commitment to maintain

135
9:00
the relationship.
This is liking.

136
9:02
Sternberg calls it liking.
And liking is really what is

137
9:07
happening in most typical
friendships, not your closest

138
9:13
friendship but friendships of a
casual kind.

139
9:18
You feel close,
you share certain information

140
9:20
with that person that you don't
share with other--many other

141
9:23
people,
but you're not physically

142
9:25
attracted and there's no
particular commitment to

143
9:28
maintaining this for a long
period of time.

144
9:32
Now, what if you're not
intimate, you're not committed,

145
9:35
but you're passionate;
you feel that sexual arousal.

146
9:39
This is what Sternberg would
call infatuation.

147
9:44
And that term probably works
for you too, infatuated love,

148
9:48
and this is love at first
sight.

149
9:51
"I don't know you,
we've never shared any secrets

150
9:54
because I don't know you,
I'm not committed to defining

151
9:59
this as anything,
I'm not committed to the future.

152
10:02
In fact, I'm not thinking about
the future.

153
10:03
I'm thinking about right now
but boy, am I attracted."

154
10:06
Right.
That's infatuation and that's

155
10:10
what Sternberg means by
infatuated love.

156
10:13
The third kind of one-element
relationship is there's no

157
10:18
intimacy, right,
no bonding,

158
10:20
no closeness,
no secrets, no physical

159
10:24
attraction, no sexual arousal,
but by gosh,

160
10:28
we are going to maintain this
relationship,

161
10:32
we are committed to it for all
time.

162
10:34
Sternberg calls that "empty
love."

163
10:37
Empty love is kind of
interesting.

164
10:39
It's often the final stage of
long-term relationships that

165
10:44
have gone bad.
"We don't share information

166
10:47
with each other anymore so
there's no intimacy.

167
10:50
We don't feel physically
attracted to each other anymore,

168
10:55
there's no passion,
but we'd better stay together

169
11:00
for the kids,
right?

170
11:02
Or we've got to stay together
for appearance's sake or we'd

171
11:05
better stay together because
financially it would be a

172
11:08
disaster if we don't" or all of
the reasons other than intimacy

173
11:11
and passion that people might
commit to each other.

174
11:14
That's what Sternberg calls
empty love.

175
11:17
Now what's interesting is in
societies where marriages are

176
11:22
arranged this is often the first
stage of a love relationship.

177
11:28
These two people who have maybe
never seen each other before,

178
11:32
who have never shared secrets
so there's no intimacy,

179
11:35
who have never--don't know if
they're physically attracted to

180
11:39
each other or on their wedding
day revealed to each other and

181
11:43
committed legally and sometimes
religiously to each other.

182
11:48
Right?
The commitment is there but at

183
11:50
that moment nothing else might
be there.

184
11:53
What's interesting of course is
that such relationships don't

185
11:58
seem to have any greater chance
of ending in divorce than people

186
12:03
who marry for love.
But there's a big confound,

187
12:07
there's a big problem in
studies of those kind of

188
12:10
relationships.
What might it be?

189
12:13
Anybody.
What might be the problem in

190
12:16
the statement I just made that
these kind of relationships are

191
12:19
just as likely to survive as
people who marry for love?

192
12:22
Yes.
Student:

193
12:24
[inaudible]
Dean Peter Salovey:

194
12:25
Yeah.
So they may occur;

195
12:28
they're more likely to occur in
societies that frown on divorce.

196
12:33
They make it very costly,
socially costly,

197
12:36
to divorce, so then they stay
together for all kinds of

198
12:39
reasons, not always such good
ones.

199
12:42
All right.
Now who was it who sang the

200
12:45
song "Two Out of Three Ain't
Bad"?

201
12:48
Was that Meat Loaf?
Who was it?

202
12:53
It was Meat Loaf.
All right.

203
12:55
Professor Bloom says it was
Meat Loaf.

204
12:57
It was Meat Loaf.
You're all saying,

205
13:01
"there was a singer called Meat
Loaf?"

206
13:05
Meat Loaf sang the song "Two
Out of Three Ain't Bad."

207
13:07
Let's see if two out of three
ain't bad.

208
13:09
What if you have intimacy,
"we share secrets,

209
13:13
passion, we feel physically
attracted to each other but

210
13:17
we're not making any commitments
here."

211
13:21
Sternberg calls that "romantic
love."

212
13:23
This is physical attraction
with close bonding but no

213
13:28
commitment, Romeo and Juliet
when they first met.

214
13:32
This is often the way
relationships start:

215
13:34
"We like each other,
I'm physically attracted to

216
13:37
each other,
I--to you, I enjoy spending

217
13:40
time with you but I'm not making
any long-term commitments.

218
13:44
So I'm not even willing to use
the ‘L' word in describing

219
13:48
what it is we have."
Right?

220
13:50
Many of you might have been in
relationships of this sort.

221
13:53
That's romance.
That's romantic love.

222
13:55
Now, what if you have intimacy,
"we share secrets with each

223
14:00
other, but there's no particular
physical attraction but we are

224
14:05
really committed to this
relationship."

225
14:08
This is what Sternberg calls
"companionate love."

226
14:11
This is your best friend.
"We are committed to sharing

227
14:15
intimacy, to being friends
forever," but physical

228
14:19
attraction is not part of the
equation here.

229
14:22
This is sort of the--maybe the
Greek ideal in relationships of

230
14:28
some kind.
All right.

231
14:30
What if we have passion,
"I'm sexually attracted to

232
14:33
you," but no intimacy.
"I don't want to really know

233
14:36
that much about you,
I don't want to really share

234
14:38
anything of me with you,
but I am committed to

235
14:40
maintaining this physical
attraction to you" [laughter]

236
14:45
Well,
that's what Sternberg calls

237
14:47
"fatuous love."
It's a whirlwind courtship.

238
14:50
It's a Hollywood romance.
It might lead to a shotgun

239
14:53
wedding.
Maybe you find yourself in Las

240
14:56
Vegas and you get married for a
day and a half and then realize

241
15:00
that this wasn't such a good
idea.

242
15:03
And maybe your name is Britney
and you're a singer.

243
15:05
[laughter]
Well, anyway,

244
15:08
you've got the idea.
That's fatuous love.

245
15:12
"We are basically committed to
each other for sex" but it's

246
15:16
very hard to make those
relationships last a long time

247
15:19
because we might not have
anything in common,

248
15:23
we might not share anything
with each other,

249
15:25
we might not trust each other,
we are not particularly bonded

250
15:28
to each other.
On the other hand,

251
15:30
if you have all three,
intimacy, passion,

252
15:32
commitment, this is "consummate
love" according to Sternberg –

253
15:36
complete love.
This is how he defines love.

254
15:40
Okay.
So now you have a definition of

255
15:43
love and you can now,
as a homework assignment,

256
15:46
sit down tonight and make a
list of every person you know by

257
15:51
the three elements of love and
just start putting the check

258
15:57
marks in the boxes and tallying
up your personal love box score.

259
16:04
And we don't want to collect
those.

260
16:05
We don't even want to see those
but you can have fun with that.

261
16:09
Then you can ask the other
people to do it too and you can

262
16:12
compare with each other.
[laughter]

263
16:13
And if you all survive this
exercise you'll be better for

264
16:17
it.
[laughter]

265
16:18
What doesn't kill you makes you
stronger.

266
16:20
That's the idea behind that
exercise.

267
16:22
All right.
Now the social psychology of

268
16:26
love really has been a social
psychology of attraction.

269
16:31
What makes people find each
other attractive?

270
16:35
What makes them want to be
intimate?

271
16:37
What makes them physically
desirable to each other?

272
16:40
What might lead to a
commitment, a decision to make a

273
16:45
commitment to make the
relationship last?

274
16:49
This is just so nice.
I'm giving this lecture on love

275
16:52
and the two of you are holding
hands here in the front row.

276
16:55
It's really-- [laughter]
And-- [applause]

277
16:59
All three elements present,
intimacy, passion,

278
17:04
and-- [laughter]
Yeah.

279
17:07
Okay.
[laughter] Good.

280
17:09
Just checking.
[laughter] Okay.

281
17:13
So what's interesting about the
social psychology of attraction

282
17:18
is it has focused on seven
variables.

283
17:22
And I've divided these into two
groups, the big three and the

284
17:26
more interesting four.
And I call them the big--The

285
17:29
big three are three variables
that the effects are so powerful

286
17:33
that they almost don't need to
be discussed in much detail.

287
17:37
The more interesting four are
the ones I'm going to focus on

288
17:41
in this lecture because they're
a bit more subtle and they may

289
17:44
be things that you've never
heard of before.

290
17:47
But let's quickly talk about
the big three.

291
17:50
The way to understand the big
three is with the phrase "all

292
17:54
other things being equal."
All other things being equal,

293
17:59
people who find themselves in
close spatial proximity to each

294
18:04
other,
like sharing an armrest in a

295
18:08
lecture, will be more likely to
be attracted to each other and

296
18:15
form a romantic relationship.
Okay, all other things being

297
18:20
equal.
Now this has been tested in

298
18:22
lots of interesting ways.
Studies have been done in the

299
18:25
city of New York where you
can--if you live in Manhattan

300
18:28
you can actually get a very nice
metric of how far apart people

301
18:32
live from each other in city
blocks.

302
18:34
Right?
You have a nice grid pattern

303
18:36
and you can use a city block
metric to add up the number of

304
18:40
blocks between people's doors.
And people who live more

305
18:43
closely together are more likely
to end up in romantic

306
18:47
relationships with each other.
It seems kind of obvious.

307
18:51
Right?
This even works on college

308
18:53
campuses.
We can measure in feet the

309
18:56
distance between the door to
your room and the door to every

310
19:00
other room of a student on
campus and there will be a

311
19:03
correlation between the
likelihood of--it's a negative

312
19:07
correlation--the likelihood of
getting into a romantic

313
19:10
relationship with a person and
the number of feet between your

314
19:14
door and that person's door.
The fewer feet,

315
19:18
the more likely a romantic
relationship,

316
19:22
all other things being equal.
Now, all other things being

317
19:26
equal is a big qualifier.
Right?

318
19:29
But if we could statistically
control for every other

319
19:32
variable, all I'd need to do is
measure the distance from your

320
19:36
door to everybody else's door on
campus and I could chart out

321
19:40
who's going to fall in love with
whom on the Yale campus.

322
19:44
Now, this idea in a way is--I
don't know.

323
19:53
Maybe it's a little
counterintuitive.

324
19:55
There is a kind of cultural
myth around the stranger,

325
19:59
the person you don't know,
who you will--who you fall in

326
20:04
love with.
And that is not likely to be

327
20:07
the case if it's the person who
is nearby.

328
20:10
Right?
And you'll see as we go through

329
20:14
the other big--the other two
"big three" that there is a kind

330
20:19
of repetition of this theme.
It isn't the stranger you fall

331
20:23
in love with.
All right.

332
20:24
Let's continue down.
Similarity.

333
20:27
You've probably heard the
phrase "Birds of a feather flock

334
20:31
together" and that's true when
it comes to romance.

335
20:34
On any dimension that
psychologists have measured in

336
20:39
these kinds of studies,
when people are more similar

337
20:43
they are more likely to find
each other attractive.

338
20:47
This could be obvious things
like height or age but it also

339
20:51
could be things like attitudes
toward capital punishment,

340
20:55
preference for the Red Sox over
the Yankees.

341
20:58
Right?
All of these are dimensions of

342
21:02
similarity.
All things being equal,

343
21:04
the more similar the more
likely you'll find each other

344
21:07
attractive.
So, opposites don't really

345
21:11
attract.
Birds of a feather may flock

346
21:14
together but opposites don't
really attract each other.

347
21:18
Now, usually at this point
somebody in the lecture hall

348
21:22
raises their hand and says,
"Well, my boyfriend or my

349
21:26
girlfriend and I are complete
opposites and how do you account

350
21:31
for that,
Professor Salovey?"

351
21:34
And I usually look at them and
I say, "Good luck."

352
21:40
[laughter]
And of course all things might

353
21:41
not be equal.
There may be other variables at

354
21:44
play but, all things being
equal, similarity does not breed

355
21:48
contempt.
Similarity breeds attraction.

356
21:52
Okay?
Isn't it interesting?

357
21:55
We have all of these common
sayings that contradict each

358
21:57
other and then empirically,
some of them turn out to have

359
22:00
more evidence supporting them
than others.

360
22:02
So "opposites attract?"
Not much evidence.

361
22:05
"Similarity breeds contempt?"
Not much evidence.

362
22:09
"Birds of a feather flock
together?"

363
22:11
Yeah, there's some evidence for
that anyway.

364
22:13
Finally, familiarity.
Familiarity--We tend to fall in

365
22:17
love with people in our
environment with whom we are

366
22:20
already familiar.
The idea that some enchanted

367
22:24
evening we will see a
stranger--Where are The New Blue

368
22:29
when you need them?
[laughter]

369
22:32
"Some enchanted evening you
will see a stranger across a

370
22:35
crowded room."
Right?

371
22:38
What musical is that from?
"South Pacific."

372
22:41
Very good.
You will see a stranger across

373
22:44
a crowded room.
That's kind of a cultural myth.

374
22:48
Of course it happens,
but much more common is

375
22:52
somebody you already know,
somebody you have seen

376
22:56
repetitively you suddenly find
attraction--attractive and a

377
23:01
relationship forms.
Okay?

378
23:05
So the big three:
People who are similar to you,

379
23:08
people who are already familiar
to you, people who are nearby in

380
23:13
space.
These are the people,

381
23:15
all things being equal,
that you will find attractive.

382
23:19
Okay?
So those are the big three.

383
23:23
Those are big main effects.
Those are big,

384
23:26
easy to observe in various ways
in the lab.

385
23:30
By the way, the familiarity
idea doesn't just work for

386
23:33
people.
I can show you words in a

387
23:36
language that you don't speak
and I can flash those words to

388
23:41
you very quickly and I can later
repeat some of those words and

389
23:46
mix in some new ones that you've
never seen before and I can say,

390
23:52
"I don't know--I know you don't
know what any of these words

391
23:55
mean.
I know you can't read these

392
23:57
characters but just,
if you had to tell me,

393
24:00
which ones do you like and
which ones don't you like or how

394
24:03
much do you like each one?"
The ones you will like are the

395
24:07
ones you saw earlier,
the ones that you already have

396
24:09
familiarity.
Even if you don't remember

397
24:12
having seen them,
even if that familiarity was

398
24:15
generated with such quick
exposures that you don't

399
24:18
remember even having seen
anything,

400
24:21
you will get that familiarity
effect.

401
24:25
Okay?
Good.

402
24:28
The more interesting four.
These are more interesting

403
24:32
because they're a little bit
complicated, a little bit

404
24:35
subtle.
Let's start with actually the

405
24:38
one that is my favorite.
This is "competence."

406
24:41
Think about other people in
your environment.

407
24:44
Think about people who are
competent.

408
24:48
Generally--And think about
people who are incompetent.

409
24:51
Generally, we are more
attracted to people who seem

410
24:54
competent to us.
Now, that isn't very

411
24:58
interesting.
And it turns out that's not

412
25:01
really the effect.
Yes, we're more attracted to

413
25:05
people who are competent than
people who we think are

414
25:08
incompetent but people who are
super competent,

415
25:11
people who seem competent on
all dimensions,

416
25:13
they're kind of threatening to
us.

417
25:15
They don't make us feel so good
about ourselves.

418
25:18
Right?
They make us feel a bit

419
25:21
diminished by comparison.
So, what we really like--The

420
25:26
kind of person we're really
attracted to is the competent

421
25:30
individual who occasionally
blunders.

422
25:34
And this is called the Pratfall
Effect, that our liking for the

423
25:39
competent person grows when they
make a mistake,

424
25:43
when they do something
embarrassing,

425
25:45
when they have a failure
experience.

426
25:48
Okay?
You can see this with public

427
25:52
figures.
Public figures who are viewed

428
25:54
as competent but who pratfall,
who make a mistake,

429
25:58
sometimes they are even more
popular after the mistake.

430
26:02
Okay?
I think of Bill Clinton when he

431
26:07
was President.
His popularity at the end of

432
26:10
his term, despite what everyone
would agree, whether you like

433
26:13
Bill Clinton or not,
was a big mistake with Monica

434
26:17
Lewinsky, his popularity didn't
suffer very much.

435
26:21
A lot of people in the media
would describe him,

436
26:23
"Well, he's just--It just shows
he's human."

437
26:26
He makes mistakes like the rest
of us, even though that was a

438
26:29
pretty big mistake.
Right?

439
26:31
And you could see this even
with smaller pratfalls.

440
26:33
Sometimes public figures are
liked even more after their

441
26:37
pratfall.
Now, the classic experiment,

442
26:40
the classic pratfall
experiment, is just a beautiful

443
26:44
one to describe.
It's a work of art.

444
26:46
So, let me tell you a little
bit about it.

445
26:49
You're in this experiment.
You're brought to the lab and

446
26:53
you're listening to a tape
recording of interviews with

447
26:57
people who are described as
possible representatives from

448
27:01
your college to appear on a quiz
show.

449
27:04
The quiz show is called
"College Bowl," which I don't

450
27:07
think is on anymore but was on
when I was in college.

451
27:10
And you're listening to
interviews with possible

452
27:13
contestants from Yale who are
going to be on "College Bowl."

453
27:17
You have to decide how
much--What you're told is you

454
27:20
have to decide who should be
chosen to be on "College Bowl."

455
27:24
And you listen to these
interviews.

456
27:26
Now what's interesting is
there's two types of people,

457
27:30
the nearly perfect person and
the mediocre person.

458
27:33
The nearly perfect person
answered 92% of the questions

459
27:38
correctly, admitted modestly to
being a member of the campus

460
27:44
honor society,
was the editor of the yearbook,

461
27:49
and ran varsity track.
That's the nearly perfect

462
27:53
person.
The mediocre person answers

463
27:57
only 30% of the questions
correctly, admits that he has

464
28:02
only average grades,
he worked on the yearbook as a

465
28:06
proofreader, and he tried out
for the track team but didn't

466
28:10
make it.
So, you see,

467
28:12
they're keeping a lot of the
elements consistent but in one

468
28:15
case he's kind of an average
performer and in the other case

469
28:18
nearly perfect.
Now, which of these two people

470
28:21
do you find more attractive in
listening to the tape?

471
28:24
So, when they ask you questions
about which person should be on

472
28:28
the quiz show,
people say the more competent

473
28:30
person.
But they also ask questions

474
28:32
like, "How attractive do you
find this person?"

475
28:35
Now, you're only listening to
an audiotape.

476
28:37
How attractive do you find this
person?

477
28:39
And the results are pretty
obvious.

478
28:43
The competent person is rated
as much more attractive,

479
28:46
considerably more attractive,
than the mediocre person.

480
28:51
Okay?
If this were the end of the

481
28:54
story though,
it would be a kind of boring

482
28:56
story and it's not the end of
the story.

483
28:58
Now, what happens is half of
the participants in the

484
29:01
experiment who have listened to
each of these tapes--You only

485
29:05
get to listen to one tape.
Half of them are assigned to

486
29:09
the blunder condition.
And what happens in the blunder

487
29:13
condition is the tape continues
and what you hear is the

488
29:16
clattering of dishes,
a person saying--the person

489
29:20
saying, "Oh, my goodness.
I've spilled coffee all over my

490
29:25
new suit."
Okay?

491
29:27
That's the blunder.
That's the pratfall.

492
29:31
Now you're asked,
"Who do you find more

493
29:33
attractive?"
And look what happens.

494
29:36
Your rating of the
attractiveness of the competent

495
29:41
person grows even higher.
The competent person who

496
29:46
blunders, this is the person
that I love.

497
29:50
Unfortunately,
the mediocre person who

498
29:53
blunders, you now think is even
more mediocre.

499
29:56
[laughter] Right?
This is the sad irony in these

500
30:00
experiments.
The effect works both ways so

501
30:03
the mediocre become even more
lowered in your esteem,

502
30:08
in your regard.
Now, I'll tell you a little

503
30:11
personal story about my coming
to Yale that relates to this

504
30:14
experiment.
This is one of the most famous

505
30:16
experiments in the history of
social psychology.

506
30:19
I wouldn't quite put it up
there.

507
30:20
You'll hear maybe later about,
or maybe you've already about

508
30:24
Milgram and maybe Asch
conformity and maybe Robber's

509
30:28
Cave.
Those are even better known

510
30:30
than this, but this is right up
there.

511
30:32
This is a top five experiment.
What--So--And it was done by

512
30:35
Elliot Aronson who has retired
now, but for many years taught

513
30:39
at the University of California
at Santa Cruz.

514
30:43
The name is not one that you
need to know.

515
30:45
In any case,
I came to Yale in 1981 as a

516
30:48
graduate student and I was
looking for an adviser and I was

517
30:52
kind of interviewing with a
faculty member at Yale at the

518
30:57
time named Judy Rodin.
Some of you may know that name

519
31:00
because she went on later to
become the President of the

520
31:03
University of Pennsylvania and
now is the President of the

521
31:06
Rockefeller Foundation.
But I was interviewing with her

522
31:10
and set up a meeting.
And what I was trying to

523
31:13
persuade her in this meeting was
to take me on as one of her

524
31:17
students, to let--to be my
adviser.

525
31:19
And it's about my third or
fourth week of graduate school

526
31:22
and I'm pretty nervous about
this.

527
31:23
And she could be intimidating
to a first-year graduate

528
31:27
student.
And I remember I was holding

529
31:30
this mug of coffee and I was
pleading with her,

530
31:33
trying to convince her to take
me on as her student,

531
31:35
and I was saying,
"Judy,

532
31:36
I'll get a lot done.
I'll work really hard.

533
31:40
I can analyze data.
I can write."

534
31:43
And I'm talking about myself
and I'm swinging--I'm using my

535
31:46
hands as I talk.
I'm swinging this cup of coffee

536
31:49
around.
And fairly soon into the

537
31:51
conversation I demonstrated some
principle that you've probably

538
31:55
learned in your physics class
having to do with an object at

539
31:59
rest remaining at rest unless
acted upon by a force.

540
32:02
Well, the object at rest was
the coffee in the cup and when I

541
32:07
pulled the coffee cup out from
under the coffee it landed right

542
32:12
on her desk and began--I watched
in slow motion as this wave of

543
32:17
coffee just moved from my side
of the desk to her side of the

544
32:22
desk.
She jumped up and jumped back

545
32:25
and started moving papers around
and really was giving me this

546
32:28
look like "Why don't you just
leave?"

547
32:31
So, I was trying to save the
moment as best as I could,

548
32:35
and I looked at her and I said,
"Judy, do you remember that old

549
32:40
experiment that Elliot Aronson
did [laughter]

550
32:44
on attractiveness?"
[laughter]

551
32:46
She looked at me kind of out of
the corner of her eye and I

552
32:51
said, "Well, that was my
blunder.

553
32:53
[laughter]
Now you're going to like me

554
32:56
even more."
[laughter]

555
32:58
And she just shook her head and
she said, "Peter,

556
33:02
Peter, Peter.
You know that effect only works

557
33:06
if I think you're competent
first."

558
33:09
[laughter]
Anyway, that was my

559
33:10
introduction to Yale,
graduate school at Yale.

560
33:13
[laughter] All right.
So blundering.

561
33:15
Only blunder if you're
competent first and it will make

562
33:19
you more attractive.
That is the Pratfall Effect.

563
33:23
Let's move on and I'm going to
move a little bit quickly

564
33:27
through all this because I want
to leave time for a few

565
33:31
questions at the end of the
lecture.

566
33:33
Let's talk about physical
attractiveness as number two of

567
33:38
the more interesting four.
Now physical attractiveness is

568
33:44
one that really bothers us.
We don't like to believe that

569
33:48
physical attractiveness accounts
for much in life.

570
33:52
It seems unfair.
Except at the margins,

571
33:55
there isn't much we can do
about physical attractiveness.

572
33:58
And when we're not pictured in
The Rumpus it can really

573
34:02
hurt.
[laughter]

574
34:03
So, we all like to believe that
physical attractiveness matters.

575
34:09
And the interesting thing is if
you do surveys of college

576
34:12
students and you say to them,
"Rate how important different

577
34:17
characteristics are in
relationships that you might be

578
34:22
involved in,"
they will say that warmth is

579
34:25
important, sensitivity is
important, intelligence is

580
34:29
important,
compassion is important,

581
34:33
a sense of humor is important,
and they'll say that looks

582
34:37
aren't important.
But if you measure all of those

583
34:42
things--Let's do it in a
different order.

584
34:45
If you send everybody out on a
blind date and then you look at,

585
34:51
after the blind date,
how many of those people who

586
34:55
are matched up blindly actually
go on a second date,

587
34:58
actually get together again,
what predicts who gets together

588
35:04
again?
Was it the rating of warmth?

589
35:08
No.
Sensitivity?

590
35:09
No.
Intelligence?

591
35:11
No.
Compassion?

592
35:13
No.
Sense of humor?

593
35:15
No.
What was it?

594
35:19
Looks.
So we believe that looks don't

595
35:24
matter and unfortunately they
do.

596
35:28
Now, the good news in all of
this is the studies that looked

597
35:32
at physical attractiveness in
this way were just looking at

598
35:36
what predicts a second date
after a first date.

599
35:39
Obviously, what predicts a
long-term relationship are

600
35:43
probably things less superficial
than looks, or at least other

601
35:47
things in addition to looks.
But it is a great predictor of

602
35:51
a second date.
And college students year after

603
35:55
year say, "But it's not
important."

604
35:57
And it's one of those classic
disassociations between what we

605
36:01
think is unimportant and what
empirically turns out to be more

606
36:04
important.
Alright well,

607
36:06
there are very interesting
studies that have been done with

608
36:08
physical attractiveness.
At the University of Minnesota,

609
36:12
a computer algorithm paired
people up.

610
36:16
It couldn't have been a very
complicated algorithm because it

611
36:20
basically paired people up
randomly on the campus.

612
36:23
But the computer--but a lot of
data about all the students on

613
36:28
campus were--was collected--were
collected and people were then

614
36:33
randomly paired up and sent to
the dance.

615
36:36
And then they were tracked over
time.

616
36:39
And just as in the thought
experiment I just gave you,

617
36:42
the University of Minnesota
students acted in the same way.

618
36:45
If the computer--If they rated
their partner as attractive,

619
36:50
the randomly assigned partner,
they were more likely to

620
36:54
continue the relationship.
Now it's interesting to ask,

621
36:59
"why?"
And we have to start to look at

622
37:02
other experiments to try to get
at what is it about physical

623
37:06
attractiveness that makes people
want to pursue the relationship?

624
37:10
And once again Elliot Aronson,
the person who did the blunder

625
37:15
experiment, the "Pratfall"
experiment, he did some nice

626
37:19
work on attractiveness as well.
And in one experiment,

627
37:23
which many people know as the
"Frizzy Wig" experiment,

628
37:26
he did the following.
He invited a confederate,

629
37:30
a graduate student who was
working with him in his

630
37:33
lab--Psychologists--Social
psychologists always call people

631
37:37
who are in the employ of the
experimenter "confederates."

632
37:41
It doesn't mean that they grew
up south of the Mason-Dixon Line

633
37:46
or wave a certain kind of flag
or--but the older term for it

634
37:50
was "stooge."
They would say,

635
37:52
"We hired a stooge to act in
the following role in the

636
37:55
experiment."
But I think a certain

637
37:57
generation of college students
thought stooges were only named

638
38:01
Moe,
Larry, and Curly and so they

639
38:03
started to use the phrase
"confederate."

640
38:06
Now, they'll usually just say,
"We hired an actor."

641
38:08
But anyway, the confederate
that they hired was a woman who

642
38:12
was naturally attractive in most
people's view but they made her

643
38:17
look either more attractive or
less attractive by giving her

644
38:22
kind of frumpy clothes,
bad make-up, and a frizzy wig.

645
38:27
And it was the frizzy wig that
everybody remembers from this

646
38:30
experiment.
And what she does in the

647
38:33
experiment is she poses as a
graduate student in clinical

648
38:36
psychology who is interviewing
male participants – only men

649
38:40
in this experiment.
And at the end of the interview

650
38:44
she gives them her own personal
clinical evaluation of their

651
38:50
personality.
Okay?

652
38:52
So, that's all it is.
They have this interview with

653
38:54
this woman.
She's either made to look very

654
38:57
good or she's made to look kind
of ugly with this frizzy wig and

655
39:01
they talk to her.
She gives them an evaluation of

656
39:05
their personality.
Half of the subjects receive a

657
39:08
favorable personality
assessment.

658
39:11
Half of them receive a kind of
unfavorable evaluation.

659
39:15
How do they respond?
Well, when she was made to look

660
39:20
attractive they were delighted
when she gave them positive

661
39:25
feedback about themselves.
When she was made to--When she

662
39:30
gave--When she was made to look
attractive but gave them

663
39:34
unfavorable information about
themselves,

664
39:38
they were really upset about it.
When she was made to look

665
39:42
unattractive they didn't really
care what kind of information

666
39:48
she gave.
It didn't really matter whether

667
39:51
it was positive or not.
It didn't really make any

668
39:55
difference.
It was interesting.

669
39:58
In the condition where she was
made to look attractive but gave

670
40:01
you bad feedback about yourself,
often the subjects in that

671
40:05
condition would look for an
opportunity to interact with her

672
40:09
in the future,
obviously to try to prove that

673
40:12
her evaluation was wrong.
It mattered that much to them.

674
40:15
So there's kind of this idea
that attractive people,

675
40:19
their feedback to us has more
impact.

676
40:22
I'm not saying this is fair,
I'm not saying it's rational,

677
40:26
I'm not endorsing it,
but empirically-- excuse

678
40:30
me--empirically we can see it,
that somehow the

679
40:35
attractive--the feedback from
the attractive person matters

680
40:41
more to us.
Okay.

681
40:43
Number three of the more
interesting four.

682
40:47
Gain, loss.
This is really a general idea

683
40:52
in psychology that we are in a
way wired up to be more

684
40:57
sensitive to change than to
steady states.

685
41:02
And you could imagine why that
might be true.

686
41:04
Change often signals danger or
opportunity and if we are

687
41:10
especially tuned-in to change,
it helps us survive and it

688
41:15
helps us pass along our genes.
Okay?

689
41:21
So we're more sensitive to
change.

690
41:23
How does that play out in love?
Well, in love we are--what is

691
41:28
very powerful to us is not just
that someone always is positive

692
41:35
toward us,
"I love you,

693
41:37
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love --" Right?

694
41:40
It wears out its welcome.
What's more powerful is the

695
41:45
person who was not that positive
to us but over time becomes more

696
41:51
positive.
The first derivative of their

697
41:55
regard for us is positive.
Okay?

698
41:59
Aronson calls this the "Gain
Effect."

699
42:01
We are really attracted to
people whose regard for us is

700
42:06
gaining momentum over time.
Okay?

701
42:10
And even if over a period of
time the average amount of their

702
42:14
regard is lower because they
started lower and then got

703
42:18
higher than someone who was
always high,

704
42:21
it's the ones who were first
lower who then went up that

705
42:26
capture our attention.
The first derivative is more

706
42:29
important than just the position
of their regard for us,

707
42:33
getting better and better.
Now, what's interesting is

708
42:37
there is also a loss effect.
People who really hurt us are

709
42:42
not the people who have always
been negative.

710
42:47
The person who every time they
sees you hates you,

711
42:51
says they hate you and
accompanies it with an obscene

712
42:55
gesture--after a while this
person can't hurt you.

713
42:59
Right?
There's a country song that

714
43:02
Ricky Skaggs sings that has the
phrase in it "Nothing can hurt

715
43:07
you like the person you love."
That's what hurts,

716
43:12
the person who always was
positive who now--whose regard

717
43:16
starts to fade.
Oh.

718
43:18
You can only hurt the one you
love.

719
43:20
Right?
You can only hurt the one you

720
43:22
love because you are expecting
positive feedback from the one

721
43:26
you love.
And when that turns negative,

722
43:29
it's a blow.
It's a blow to the solar plexus.

723
43:33
Right?
So you can only hurt the one

724
43:36
you can love but the one who
always loves you sometimes has

725
43:39
trouble showing you that they
love you.

726
43:41
The one who didn't really love
you that much but then starts to

727
43:46
show you that they love you,
that person is a powerful

728
43:49
influence on your behavior.
Okay.

729
43:54
The last--Oops.
Come back.

730
43:57
The last set of studies--Have
you talked about Schacter,

731
44:02
Singer's "Emotions"?
Okay.

732
44:04
So let me describe to you this
phenomenon.

733
44:08
This is a phenomenon about the
misattribution for the causes of

734
44:16
arousal.
You feel physiologically

735
44:20
aroused but you're not
completely sure why,

736
44:24
and you have to make up an
explanation for it.

737
44:29
I think what I want to do--And
sometimes that explanation is

738
44:33
accurate, but the ones that are
interesting here are the ones

739
44:37
where you misattribute the cause
of the arousal--you make a

740
44:41
mistake and think it's love when
it might be due to something

741
44:46
else.
So, let's do a thought

742
44:49
experiment.
I'm a Yale college student,

743
44:52
for the purposes of this
thought experiment and I live in

744
44:56
Pierson because I need to walk a
great distance to Chapel Street,

745
45:02
to the Starbuck's on Chapel
Street.

746
45:04
And I have a friend who I don't
know that well,

747
45:07
somebody who was sitting next
to me in class a few weeks in a

748
45:11
row.
And I said, "Would you like to

749
45:14
go see The New Blue in concert
and then get coffee after it

750
45:20
Friday night?"
And she says to me, "Sure.

751
45:24
I would do that."
And so The New Blue concert

752
45:27
takes place in the
Pierson-Davenport Theater in the

753
45:30
basement there – what used to
be a squash court is now a

754
45:34
little theater – and we enjoy
ourselves at the concert and

755
45:38
then I say,
"Let's go to Starbuck's and get

756
45:41
a coffee."
And so, we walk that distance

757
45:44
from Pierson College down to the
York Street Gate,

758
45:49
over to Chapel Street,
make the left on Chapel Street,

759
45:53
another block down to High,
walk into the Starbuck's.

760
45:57
And she says to me,
"You know, I'd better have a

761
46:01
decaf because it's kind of late
and I want to be able to sleep."

762
46:07
And I say, "That's fine.
Whatever you want."

763
46:09
She says, "Yeah.
So I'll have a decaf double

764
46:12
espresso mocha skinny with a--"
What?

765
46:16
What other dimensions are there?
[laughter] Right?

766
46:18
"A double espresso mocha skinny
frothed."

767
46:24
[laughter] And I say, "Okay.
Fine.

768
46:25
I'll have a coffee."
[laughter]

769
46:27
And I go up there and I order
the drinks.

770
46:30
"I'll have a small coffee
please and a double espresso

771
46:35
mocha skinny frothed" except the
barista makes a mistake.

772
46:40
Did the word "barista" exist
before Starbuck's?

773
46:43
[laughter] I don't think so.
The barista makes a mistake.

774
46:48
The barista uses caffeinated
coffee in the drink instead of

775
46:53
decaf, doesn't tell anybody,
doesn't tell me.

776
46:57
I don't see it.
I just come back with my black

777
47:01
coffee and my double espresso
mocha latte skinny frothed,

778
47:07
except it isn't espresso.
It's got two shots of

779
47:12
caffeinated espresso.
I'm sorry.

780
47:14
It isn't decaffeinated.
It's got two shots of

781
47:17
caffeinated espresso in it.
And I put it down on the table

782
47:21
and we're having this nice
conversation and we're drinking

783
47:25
our beverages and it's about
12:30/1:00 now and Starbuck's is

784
47:29
closing and it's time to walk
back to Pierson.

785
47:33
And we're walking back to
Pierson and we leave the

786
47:37
Starbuck's, we make a left on
Chapel Street,

787
47:41
we're walking up to York,
I'm getting a little sleepy,

788
47:45
but my friend looks at me and
says,

789
47:48
"Huh.
I feel a little funny."

790
47:50
What's actually happening?
Her heart is beating a little

791
47:55
faster, her palms are beginning
to sweat, her breath is coming a

792
48:00
little shorter than it otherwise
would.

793
48:03
"I don't know.
Is it warm in here?"

794
48:08
And she said,
"I don't think I've felt this

795
48:12
way in a very long time.
[laughter] "Gee.

796
48:16
It couldn't be the coffee.
I ordered decaf.

797
48:21
What could this be?
What.."

798
48:23
And she turns and she looks at
me [laughter]

799
48:29
and she says,
"What a day this has been.

800
48:34
What a rare mood I'm in.
Why, it's almost like being in

801
48:39
love."
[laughter]

802
48:41
And it is almost like being in
love except what it really is is

803
48:44
two shots of caffeinated
espresso [laughter]

804
48:46
causing a rapid heart rate,
an increase in respiration,

805
48:50
sweaty palms,
but I don't realize--she

806
48:53
doesn't realize that's what it
is.

807
48:57
She turns to the most
salient--and this is the way

808
49:00
social psychologists would say
it--turns to the most salient

809
49:03
object in her immediate social
environment--that would be

810
49:07
me--and [laughter]
says she's in love.

811
49:10
That's the idea of
misattribution--aroused due to

812
49:13
something else,
"don't know what that is."

813
49:16
It's best if you don't know
what that is or even if you do

814
49:19
mistakenly attribute it,
misattribute it,

815
49:22
to physical attraction,
romance, intimacy,

816
49:26
passion and commitment,
it's love.

817
49:29
All right.
Now, I don't necessarily

818
49:33
recommend that you do this
thought experiment in vivo this

819
49:39
weekend,
although if you're lonely you

820
49:42
might want to try it but
[laughter]

821
49:45
we can go--we can take this
idea right--We can actually do

822
49:48
research on this.
We could take it into the lab.

823
49:51
But before I tell you about lab
experiments let me tell you

824
49:54
about the most famous field
experiment on this idea.

825
49:57
We call this the "Rickety
Bridge" experiment.

826
50:00
And there is a bridge at the
University of British Columbia

827
50:05
that crosses a river that runs
through campus and the

828
50:09
rickety--There's actually two
bridges.

829
50:12
The rickety bridge is one
that's kind of a rope bridge.

830
50:16
It's hundreds of feet above the
river.

831
50:19
It sways in the breeze.
It's only about three feet wide.

832
50:23
You kind of hold on to it
carefully and you cross the

833
50:26
river.
It's a pretty scary way to

834
50:27
cross that river.
Has anybody been--seen this

835
50:30
bridge?
It's still there.

836
50:31
Yes.
You know this bridge.

837
50:32
Okay.
There's another way to cross

838
50:35
the river.
It's on a low bridge near the

839
50:38
water, solid wood planks,
nice and wide,

840
50:41
hand railings made out of solid
wood, and you can cross the

841
50:45
bridge that way.
So, what two investigators at

842
50:49
the University of British
Columbia did is they simply

843
50:52
positioned,
once again, an attractive actor

844
50:57
or confederate on one side of
the bridge.

845
51:03
She was a woman and she met men
crossing the bridge.

846
51:10
And she would intercept them as
they came across the rickety

847
51:13
bridge, or the low bridge,
and she would ask them a few

848
51:17
questions and conclude with,
"Can you write me a story?

849
51:20
You would help me out with my
experiment if you'd just write a

850
51:24
little story right now."
Then she would collect their

851
51:27
story and she would say,
"If you have any questions

852
51:30
about this experiment,
here is my phone number."

853
51:33
Actually, this happens when
you're in experiments.

854
51:35
You get the phone number of the
experimenter.

855
51:37
What happens?
Well, the men,

856
51:40
male students,
who cross the rickety bridge,

857
51:44
they wrote these sexy stories
with interesting content,

858
51:50
with kind of little bit ribald
themes.

859
51:56
And the people on the solid
bridge, they just wrote pretty

860
52:00
boring stories.
The people who crossed the

861
52:03
rickety bridge were more likely
to call her up later and say,

862
52:07
"Yeah.
I'd like to talk about that

863
52:08
experiment I was in.
Could we meet at the Starbuck's?

864
52:11
[laughter]
You drink decaf,

865
52:13
don't you?"
Right?

866
52:15
And the people on the low
bridge were much less likely to

867
52:19
call her up.
Okay?

868
52:22
What was going on?
Well, this was interpreted as

869
52:25
misattributed arousal.
On the rickety bridge you're

870
52:28
swaying in the breeze hundreds
of feet above the water,

871
52:31
the bridge seems unstable.
Maybe you'll make it.

872
52:34
Maybe you won't.
Your heart is beating,

873
52:36
your palms are sweating,
you're breathing harder.

874
52:39
You meet this person and she
seems more attractive because

875
52:42
you're feeling all these things.
And you attribute it to the

876
52:47
attraction.
Now, there's a reason why this

877
52:50
study is bad science.
There's a major flaw in this

878
52:56
study.
The clue to the flaw is that

879
52:59
you can't even call this study
an experiment.

880
53:03
What's the flaw?
Anybody.

881
53:05
Yes.
Student: The people who

882
53:11
would take the rickety bridge
might be more likely to be more

883
53:14
[inaudible]
Dean Peter Salovey:

884
53:15
People who take the rickety
bridge might be the kind of

885
53:18
people who are more looking for
adventure than the people who

886
53:20
take the solid bridge.
Right.

887
53:22
Another way of saying it is
there isn't random assignment of

888
53:26
the subjects to the two
conditions in the study.

889
53:30
That's no random assignment;
it's not an experiment.

890
53:33
You--By not randomly assigning
people to these two conditions,

891
53:37
you may be capturing just
individual differences in the

892
53:41
kind of person who,
when there's a perfectly

893
53:45
stable, safe,
low bridge, says,

894
53:47
"Huh uh.
I won't want to go on that

895
53:49
bridge.
I want to go on the bridge

896
53:51
where I have to risk my life to
get to class."

897
53:55
[laughter]
And then should it surprise us

898
53:57
that that's the kind of person
who would call a perfect

899
54:00
stranger on the telephone and
write a sexy story and give it

900
54:03
to them?
[laughter] Right?

901
54:04
We're not so surprised.
So what we have to do,

902
54:07
of course, is take it in to the
lab and do this in a more

903
54:11
systematic way with random
assignment.

904
54:14
And this is how I'll want to
finish up today.

905
54:17
We have until 2:45,3:45?
Okay.

906
54:21
Great.
I'll take about five more

907
54:23
minutes to finish up and that'll
give us some time for questions.

908
54:27
So how do you do this in the
lab?

909
54:30
Well, you can bring people in
to the lab and I can present you

910
54:36
with a confederate who--Let's
say you are all in condition

911
54:42
one,
everybody on this side of the

912
54:45
room, and I can say to all of
you, "Please wait here.

913
54:48
We'll begin the experiment in a
moment.

914
54:53
While you're waiting please
fill out this form."

915
54:56
And the form includes how
attractive--how attracted you

916
55:01
are to the experimenter,
to me.

917
55:04
I can do the same thing over
here.

918
55:06
I can give you the form and ask
you to rate how attractive you

919
55:10
think I am and I can give you
the same instruction with a

920
55:15
crucial difference:
"Please wait here.

921
55:18
We will begin the painful shock
experiment in a moment.

922
55:24
Please fill out these forms
while you wait."

923
55:27
What happens?
The people who got the painful

924
55:31
shock instruction are more
likely to find the confederate

925
55:35
attractive.
[laughter] Why?

926
55:38
While they're sitting there
thinking about painful shock

927
55:41
it's making their heart beat
faster,

928
55:43
it's making their palms sweat,
it's making them breathe harder

929
55:47
maybe.
And even though it's fairly

930
55:50
obvious what's doing that,
they still misattribute that

931
55:54
arousal to "I must be falling in
love,"

932
55:57
even with that obvious a--even
with that obvious an

933
56:02
instruction.
You can do this in other ways.

934
56:05
You can bring--Here is one of
my favorite ones.

935
56:08
You bring people in the lab.
We'll make them the control

936
56:12
group this time.
We bring you in the--to the lab

937
56:14
and we say to this group of
people, "Please wait here.

938
56:17
We'll begin the experiment in a
moment.

939
56:20
You can fill out these forms in
the meantime."

940
56:22
The forms ask how attracted you
are to the experimenter.

941
56:25
You're now in the experimental
group and I say,

942
56:30
"Please wait here.
We'll begin the experiment in a

943
56:33
moment.
I'm going to ask you to fill

944
56:35
out some forms but first,
to get ready for this

945
56:38
experiment,
I'd like you to get on this

946
56:40
treadmill and run for ten
minutes."

947
56:42
So you've run on the treadmill.
You've just sat around.

948
56:46
The people who've run on the
treadmill, even when that

949
56:49
arousal is fairly obvious,
you've got--you--doing a little

950
56:53
bit of aerobic exercise,
you still find the experimenter

951
56:57
more attractive.
Okay?

952
56:59
This is why the fourth floor of
Payne Whitney Gym is such a

953
57:05
dangerous place [laughter]
and I urge you as your dean to

954
57:10
be very careful there.
[laughter] Okay?

955
57:14
It's that combination of
aerobic exercise and spandex

956
57:18
[laughter]
that leads to trouble.

957
57:20
All right.
Now, here's the final

958
57:22
experiment and I apologize for
this.

959
57:24
It is a bit sexist in 2007
context, but let me explain.

960
57:31
And we could never do this--and
one could never do this

961
57:34
experiment today but let me go
through it with you and you'll

962
57:38
apologize for its--some of its
qualities.

963
57:41
In this experiment male
subjects were brought in to the

964
57:45
lab and they were asked to look
at centerfolds from

965
57:49
Playboy magazine.
So, these are essentially

966
57:53
photographs of naked women.
And they are wearing headphones

967
57:58
that amplify their heartbeat and
they are asked among other

968
58:04
things how attracted are they to
the centerfold photograph that

969
58:10
they're looking at.
So, maybe--I don't remember how

970
58:14
many they look at.
Maybe it's about 10.

971
58:16
So, these slides are coming up.
They've got the headphones on.

972
58:20
The headphones are amplifying
their heartbeat and the slides

973
58:26
are moving one after another for
a few seconds each slide and

974
58:32
they're listening to their
heartbeat.

975
58:36
Slide one.
Slide two.

976
58:42
Slide three.
Slide four.

977
58:48
Slide five.
Slide six.

978
58:55
And then they're asked which
one did you find most

979
58:58
attractive, which one are you
most attracted to?

980
59:02
"Oh, slide five, absolutely.
She's the woman I want to

981
59:07
marry."
[laughter] Right?

982
59:09
And what has happened is
they're using this bodily cue of

983
59:13
their heartbeat to infer that
that's who they find more

984
59:18
attractive.
Now, here is the twist.

985
59:22
They're not actually listening
to their heartbeat.

986
59:25
They're listening to a tape
recording of a heartbeat.

987
59:31
And the experimenter is back
there with the speed knob

988
59:35
[laughter]
and at random intervals he just

989
59:38
speeds up the tape of their
heart [laughter]

990
59:41
and then slows it down.
And it doesn't matter which

991
59:46
slide he speeds up the tape of
the heartbeat on,

992
59:51
that's the one the subject is
more likely to think is the

993
59:56
person of their dreams,
the person they're attracted to.

994
60:00
So even you can misattribute
real arousal.

995
60:04
You can even misattribute phony
arousal, arousal that isn't even

996
60:09
coming from your body.
It's just coming--It's just

997
60:13
being played to you randomly.
You can even misattribute that.

998
60:18
Okay.
I think these experiments are

999
60:20
cute and I think there's an
interesting phenomenon there.

1000
60:24
And it says something,
in a way, about how easily we

1001
60:28
can be misled as to what things
in our environment,

1002
60:31
even things coming from our own
body, mean.

1003
60:34
But there's also some very
serious implications of this

1004
60:38
kind of work.
One of them has to do with

1005
60:41
domestic violence.
So think about domestic

1006
60:44
violence situations and why
people stay in them.

1007
60:48
Why do people stay in
relationships that are violent?

1008
60:51
Now the number one reason,
and we have to acknowledge it

1009
60:55
up front, is usually
economically there's no

1010
60:58
alternative or people believe
there's no alternative.

1011
61:02
"I can't leave because if I
leave I'd be homeless.

1012
61:06
If I leave I will starve,
if my--if I leave my kids will

1013
61:10
starve or there'll be danger to
my kids."

1014
61:13
And that keeps people trapped
in abusive relationships

1015
61:17
but--And that's number one,
but what else might be going

1016
61:21
on?
Sometimes people don't realize

1017
61:24
that the relationship they're in
is abusive--it's psychologically

1018
61:30
or emotionally abusive.
They get into these fights and

1019
61:34
screaming matches and
name-calling and such even if

1020
61:37
it's not physical violence.
And they feel a certain arousal

1021
61:42
when that happens and they
misattribute it.

1022
61:47
"Well, he wouldn't be yelling
and screaming at me if he didn't

1023
61:50
love me."
Right?

1024
61:52
They misattribute that,
what might be anger,

1025
61:55
what might even be aggression
and violence,

1026
61:58
to an expression of love.
I have a friend who's a social

1027
62:03
psychologist who told me a story
once that really made me very

1028
62:09
nervous, although she's fine.
She said, "When I was dating my

1029
62:14
husband"--this is thirty years
ago--"we were having a tough

1030
62:18
time.
We were in many,

1031
62:19
many arguments--We got into
many, many arguments and one

1032
62:23
time something happened where he
came up to my car in a parking

1033
62:27
lot and he was yelling at me
through the window.

1034
62:31
And I rolled up the window and
before you know it he had

1035
62:35
punched out the window."
And yelling at her and punched

1036
62:39
out the window.
He didn't touch her.

1037
62:41
And he--she said to me,
"That's when I knew he really

1038
62:46
loved me."
And I thought that's scary and

1039
62:49
I--and, all joking aside,
that's scary but that's

1040
62:53
misattributed arousal.
"I'm feeling--when he did that

1041
62:57
I felt something and I assumed
it was love.

1042
62:59
What she was misattributing as
love--Well, she was

1043
63:03
misattributing his aggressive
response as love.

1044
63:07
She was misattributing her own
fear as mutual attraction,

1045
63:12
as "And I must love him."
So, although we joke about

1046
63:17
these kinds of experiments,
and they are fun to talk about

1047
63:22
because they are unusual and
cute,

1048
63:25
there is also some serious
implications of this kind of

1049
63:28
work that one might think about.
And you might think about other

1050
63:31
possible implications as well.
Okay.

1051
63:34
Let me stop there and see what
kinds of questions we might

1052
63:37
have.
[applause]

1053
63:38
Dean Peter Salovey:
Thank you.

1054
63:39


1055
63:47
Thanks very much.
That's very kind of you.

1056
63:49
Because we are on tape I'll
repeat any questions that come

1057
63:52
in.
Yeah.

1058
63:53
Student: [inaudible]
Dean Peter Salovey:

1059
64:06
Right.
So the question is in

1060
64:10
experiments like the painful
shock experiment if you are told

1061
64:14
in advance,
like you all are,

1062
64:16
through a consent form or by
the experimenter,

1063
64:19
"This is an experiment
involving painful shock,"

1064
64:22
will you still rate the
experimenter as more attractive

1065
64:26
or will you not be able to
misattribute the arousal?

1066
64:30
It is true.
The more salient we make the

1067
64:33
source of the arousal,
the less likely you can get the

1068
64:37
effect.
If in my thought experiment I

1069
64:40
say to my friend,
"Well, I know why you're

1070
64:43
feeling that way.
The reason why you're feeling

1071
64:47
that way is ‘cause the barista
made a mistake and gave you

1072
64:51
caffeinated espresso when you
asked for decaf or maybe you

1073
64:54
just love me."
Right.

1074
64:56
The person is not likely to
say, "Oh, I bet it's love."

1075
64:59
They're more likely to think
oh, caffeine,

1076
65:01
yeah.
That's the parsimonious

1077
65:03
explanation here."
So it is true.

1078
65:05
The more salient you make the
cause of the arousal,

1079
65:08
the less likely you'll get the
effect but you can see even in

1080
65:11
experiments where the cause of
the arousal is somewhat obvious,

1081
65:15
at least to us,
you can still get a

1082
65:18
misattribution effect.
Other questions.

1083
65:21
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

1084
65:26
Dean Peter Salovey:
Yeah.

1085
65:31
So the question is are any of
these factors,

1086
65:34
particularly the big three,
proximity,

1087
65:37
familiarity,
and similarity--Do they affect

1088
65:40
the maintenance of relationships
or just the initial attraction?

1089
65:44
It's interesting.
My guess is they affect both

1090
65:48
initial and maintenance over
time but the literature mostly

1091
65:52
focuses on initial attraction,
much richer data on that

1092
65:56
initial attraction and those
initial stages of the

1093
65:59
relationship in part because
it's a little hard to follow

1094
66:03
couples over time.
Imagine the sort of

1095
66:06
Heisenberg-esque problems we
would get carefully following

1096
66:12
romantic couples over time and
interfering with them to ask

1097
66:18
questions and make observations.
It would be hard to let this

1098
66:23
couple naturally--this
relationship naturally unfold.

1099
66:27
So, we really get--So,
really the focus of many of

1100
66:30
these experiments is on initial
attraction.

1101
66:32
That's why I always say my
lecture is on love,

1102
66:36
the definition of terms is
about love,

1103
66:38
but the experiments really are
much more about attraction than

1104
66:43
about love.
Another question.

1105
66:45
Yes.
Student: Can someone

1106
66:47
feel consummate love for more
than one person?

1107
66:48
Dean Peter Salovey: Oh.
Can someone feel consummate

1108
66:51
love for more than one person?
That's a very good question.

1109
66:55
It's actually a question that's
debated in the literature.

1110
66:58
I didn't get into it at all in
this experiment--in this

1111
67:01
lecture--but there's an
interesting debate going on

1112
67:05
about love and many other
emotions between people who take

1113
67:09
a kind of evolutionary
perspective on these states

1114
67:12
versus people who take what
might be called a more socially

1115
67:16
constructed perspective.
And these aren't necessarily so

1116
67:20
incompatible but the
evolutionary perspective I think

1117
67:24
would argue that you can feel
that kind of love for more than

1118
67:28
one person or at least it would
facilitate the passing on of

1119
67:32
your genetic material to a
larger array of the next

1120
67:36
generation.
So I think the evolutionary

1121
67:40
explanation is not a problem but
we have constructed a world

1122
67:45
where in most societies,
except for very unusual

1123
67:50
polygamist societies,
the belief is that you can't

1124
67:55
love more than one.
Right.

1125
67:59
And so you've got this tension
between what might be

1126
68:03
evolutionarily wired impulses
and the kind of social

1127
68:07
constraints that say this isn't
good,

1128
68:10
this isn't appropriate,
this is taboo.

1129
68:12
And my guess is the result is
yes, you could but you're not

1130
68:17
going to feel un-conflicted
about it and it's because these

1131
68:21
two are conflicting each other
at the same time.

1132
68:25
How about one more question and
then we'll let you go?

1133
68:28
I'm sorry.
I saw him first.

1134
68:30
Student: Wouldn't
natural selection favor the

1135
68:33
people who learn all these
things and then practically try

1136
68:37
to apply them?
Dean Peter Salovey: So

1137
68:38
he's making the evolutionary
argument.

1138
68:40
Wouldn't natural selection
favor the people who take

1139

introductory psychology,
come to my Valentine's Day

1140
68:47
lecture, listen carefully to the
big three and the more

1141
68:50
interesting four,
and then go out there and put

1142
68:52
them into practice?
It feels a little bit like

1143
68:55
the--like we're trying to pass
on an acquired characteristic,

1144
68:59
which is a little bit counter
to Darwinian theory but if

1145
69:04
somehow you could design a
proclivity for learning this

1146
69:09
kind of material,
evolution might indeed favor it.

1147
69:14
I can tell you this much.
It would make the several

1148
69:17
thousands social psychologists
in this world very happy and

1149
69:22
proud of their field,
if that turned out to be true.

1150
69:26
Anyway, thank you all very much.
Happy Valentine's Day!

1151

Thanks!
