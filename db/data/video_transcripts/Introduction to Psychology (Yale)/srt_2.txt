Professor Paul Bloom:
We're going to begin the class

2
0:17
proper, Introduction to
Psychology, with a discussion

3
0:20
about the brain.
And, in particular,

4
0:23
I want to lead off the class
with an idea that the Nobel

5
0:28
Prize winning biologist,
Francis Crick,

6
0:32
described as "The Astonishing
Hypothesis."

7
0:36
And The Astonishing Hypothesis
is summarized like this.

8
0:42
As he writes,
The Astonishing Hypothesis is

9
0:44
that:
You, your joys and your

10
0:46
sorrows, your memories and your
ambitions, your sense of

11
0:49
personal identity and free will
are in fact no more than the

12
0:52
behavior of a vast assembly of
nerve cells and their associated

13
0:56
molecules.
As Lewis Carroll's Alice might

14
0:59
have phrased it,
"you're nothing but a pack of

15
1:02
neurons."
It is fair to describe this as

16
1:05
astonishing.
It is an odd and unnatural view

17
1:09
and I don't actually expect
people to believe it at first.

18
1:13
It's an open question whether
you'll believe it when this

19
1:17
class comes to an end,
but I'd be surprised if many of

20
1:21
you believe it now.
Most people don't.

21
1:23
Most people,
in fact, hold a different view.

22
1:28
Most people are dualists.
Now, dualism is a very

23
1:32
different doctrine.
It's a doctrine that can be

24
1:36
found in every religion and in
most philosophical systems

25
1:40
throughout history.
It was very explicit in Plato,

26
1:43
for instance.
But the most articulate and

27
1:46
well-known defender of dualism
is the philosopher Rene

28
1:50
Descartes,
and Rene Descartes explicitly

29
1:55
asked a question,
"Are humans merely physical

30
1:59
machines,
merely physical things?"

31
2:01
And he answered, "no."
He agreed that animals are

32
2:06
machines.
In fact, he called them "beast

33
2:09
machines" and said animals,
nonhuman animals are merely

34
2:13
robots, but people are
different.

35
2:16
There's a duality of people.
Like animals,

36
2:19
we possess physical material
bodies, but unlike animals,

37
2:24
what we are is not physical.
We are immaterial souls that

38
2:29
possess physical bodies,
that have physical bodies,

39
2:33
that reside in physical bodies,
that connect to physical

40
2:37
bodies.
So, this is known as dualism

41
2:39
because the claim is,
for humans at least,

42
2:42
there are two separate things;
there's our material bodies and

43
2:46
there's our immaterial minds.
Now, Descartes made two

44
2:50
arguments for dualism.
One argument involved

45
2:54
observations of a human action.
So, Descartes lived in a fairly

46
3:00
sophisticated time,
and his time did have robots.

47
3:04
These were not electrical
robots, of course.

48
3:06
They were robots powered by
hydraulics.

49
3:09
So, Descartes would walk around
the French Royal Gardens and the

50
3:13
French Royal Gardens were set up
like a seventeenth-century

51
3:16
Disneyland.
They had these characters that

52
3:19
would operate according to water
flow and so if you stepped on a

53
3:23
certain panel,
a swordsman would jump out with

54
3:26
a sword.
If you stepped somewhere else,

55
3:29
a bathing beauty would cover
herself up behind some bushes.

56
3:32
And Descartes said,
"Boy, these machines respond in

57
3:36
certain ways to certain actions
so machines can do certain

58
3:41
things and,
in fact," he says,

59
3:43
"our bodies work that way too.
If you tap somebody on the

60
3:45
knee, your leg will jump out.
Well, maybe that's what we are."

61
3:49
But Descartes said that can't
be because there are things that

62
3:53
humans do that no machine could
ever do.

63
3:56
Humans are not limited to
reflexive action.

64
4:00
Rather, humans are capable of
coordinated, creative,

65
4:04
spontaneous things.
We can use language,

66
4:07
for instance,
and sometimes my use of

67
4:09
language can be reflexive.
Somebody says, "How are you?"

68
4:13
And I say, "I am fine.
How are you?"

69
4:15
But sometimes I could say what
I choose to be,

70
4:19
"How are you?"
"Pretty damn good."

71
4:21
I can just choose.
And machines,

72
4:23
Descartes argued,
are incapable of that sort of

73
4:26
choice.
Hence, we are not mere machines.

74
4:30
The second argument is,
of course, quite famous and

75
4:34
this was the method.
This he came to using the

76
4:37
method of doubt.
So, he started asking himself

77
4:40
the question,
"What can I be sure of?"

78
4:43
And he said,
"Well, I believe there's a God,

79
4:46
but honestly,
I can't be sure there's a God.

80
4:50
I believe I live in a rich
country but maybe I've been

81
4:53
fooled."
He even said,

82
4:55
"I believe I have had friends
and family but maybe I am being

83
5:00
tricked.
Maybe an evil demon,

84
5:02
for instance,
has tricked me,

85
5:04
has deluded me into thinking I
have experiences that aren't

86
5:08
real."
And, of course,

87
5:10
the modern version of this is
The Matrix.

88
5:12
The idea of The Matrix is
explicitly built upon

89
5:15
Cartesian--Descartes' worries
about an evil demon.

90
5:18
Maybe everything you're now
experiencing is not real,

91
5:21
but rather is the product of
some other, perhaps malevolent,

92
5:25
creature.
Descartes, similarly,

93
5:28
could doubt he has a body.
In fact, he noticed that madmen

94
5:33
sometimes believe they have
extra limbs or they believe

95
5:35
they're of different sizes and
shapes than they really are and

96
5:38
Descartes said,
"How do I know I'm not crazy?

97
5:41
Crazy people don't think
they're crazy so the fact that I

98
5:44
don't think I'm crazy doesn't
mean I'm not crazy.

99
5:47
How do I know," Descartes said,
"I'm not dreaming right now?"

100
5:51
But there is one thing,
Descartes concluded,

101
5:54
that he cannot doubt,
and the answer is he cannot

102
5:57
doubt that he is himself
thinking.

103
5:59
That would be self-refuting.
And so, Descartes used the

104
6:03
method of doubt to say there's
something really different about

105
6:08
having a body that's always
uncertain from having a mind.

106
6:13
And he used this argument as a
way to support dualism,

107
6:18
as a way to support the idea
that bodies and minds are

108
6:23
separate.
And so he concluded,

109
6:26
"I knew that I was a substance,
the whole essence or nature of

110
6:29
which is to think,
and that for its existence,

111
6:32
there is no need of any place
nor does it depend on any

112
6:35
material thing.
That is to say,

113
6:38
the soul by which I am,
when I am, is entirely distinct

114
6:43
from body."
Now, I said before that this is

115
6:46
common sense and I want to
illustrate the common sense

116
6:49
nature of this in a few ways.
One thing is our dualism is

117
6:53
enmeshed in our language.
So, we have a certain mode of

118
6:57
talking about things that we own
or things that are close to us

119
7:01
– my arm,
my heart, my child,

120
7:03
my car – but we also extend
that to my body and my brain.

121
7:07
We talk about owning our brains
as if we're somehow separate

122
7:12
from them.
Our dualism shows up in

123
7:14
intuitions about personal
identity.

124
7:17
And what this means is that
common sense tells us that

125
7:21
somebody can be the same person
even if their body undergoes

126
7:25
radical and profound changes.
The best examples of this are

127
7:31
fictional.
So, we have no problem

128
7:34
understanding a movie where
somebody goes to sleep as a

129
7:38
teenager and wakes up as
Jennifer Garner,

130
7:41
as an older person.
Now, nobody says,

131
7:44
"Oh, that's a documentary.
I believe that thoroughly true"

132
7:48
but at the same time nobody,
no adult, no teenager,

133
7:52
no child ever leaves and says,
"I'm totally conceptually

134
7:55
confused."
Rather, we follow the story.

135
8:01
We can also follow stories
which involve more profound

136
8:05
transformations as when a man
dies and is reborn into the body

137
8:10
of a child.
Now, you might have different

138
8:13
views around--People around this
room will have different views

139
8:16
as to whether reincarnation
really exists,

140
8:19
but we can imagine it.
We could imagine a person dying

141
8:22
and then reemerging in another
body.

142
8:24
This is not Hollywood invention.
One of the great short stories

143
8:28
of the last century begins with
a sentence by Franz Kafka:

144
8:31
"As Gregor Samsa woke one
morning from uneasy dreams,

145
8:34
he found himself transformed in
his bed into a gigantic insect."

146
8:38
And again, Kafka invites us to
imagine waking up into a body of

147
8:43
a cockroach and we can.
This is also not modern.

148
8:47
Hundreds of years before the
birth of Christ,

149
8:51
Homer described the fate of the
companions of Odysseus who were

150
8:56
transformed by a witch into
pigs.

151
9:00
Actually, that's not quite
right.

152
9:01
She didn't turn them into pigs.
She did something worse.

153
9:05
She stuck them in the bodies of
pigs.

154
9:08
They had the head and voice and
bristles and body of swine but

155
9:11
their minds remained unchanged
as before, so they were penned

156
9:14
there weeping.
And we are invited to imagine

157
9:17
the fate of again finding
ourselves in the bodies of other

158
9:21
creatures and,
if you can imagine this,

159
9:24
this is because you are
imagining what you are as

160
9:27
separate from the body that you
reside in.

161
9:31
We allow for the notion that
many people can occupy one body.

162
9:34
This is a mainstay of some
slapstick humor including the

163
9:37
classic movie,
All of Me--Steve Martin

164
9:40
and Lily Tomlin – highly
recommended.

165
9:42
But many people think this sort
of thing really happens.

166
9:46
One analysis of multiple
personality disorder is that you

167
9:50
have many people inside a single
body fighting it out for

168
9:54
control.
Now, we will discuss multiple

169
9:56
personality disorder towards the
end of the semester and it turns

170
10:00
out things are a good deal more
complicated than this,

171
10:03
but still my point isn't about
how it really is but how we

172
10:06
think about it.
Common sense tells us you could

173
10:09
have more than one person inside
a single body.

174
10:12
This shows up in a different
context involving exorcisms

175
10:15
where many belief systems allow
for the idea that people's

176
10:19
behavior,
particularly their evil or

177
10:22
irrational behavior,
could be because something else

178
10:25
has taken over their bodies.
Finally, most people around the

179
10:31
world, all religions and most
people in most countries at most

180
10:39
times,
believe that people can survive

181
10:42
the destruction of their bodies.
Now, cultures differ according

182
10:47
to the fate of the body.
Some cultures have the body

183
10:51
going to--sorry--the fate of the
soul.

184
10:53
Some cultures have you going to
Heaven or descending to Hell.

185
10:57
Others have you occupying
another body.

186
10:59
Still, others have you
occupying an amorphous spirit

187
11:02
world.
But what they share is the idea

188
11:04
that what you are is separable
from this physical thing you

189
11:08
carry around.
And the physical thing that you

190
11:12
carry around can be destroyed
while you live on.

191
11:18
These views are particularly
common in the United States.

192
11:22
In one survey done in Chicago a
few years ago,

193
11:25
people were asked their
religion and then were asked

194
11:28
what would happen to them when
they died.

195
11:31
Most people in the sample were
Christian and about 96% of

196
11:35
Christians said,
"When I die I'm going to go to

197
11:38
Heaven."
Some of the sample was Jewish.

198
11:41
Now, Judaism is actually a
religion with a less than clear

199
11:44
story about the afterlife.
Still, most of the subjects who

200
11:48
identified themselves as Jewish
said when they die they will go

201
11:52
to Heaven.
Some of the sampled denied

202
11:55
having any religion at all--said
they have no religion at all.

203
11:58
Still, when these people were
asked what would happen when

204
12:02
they would die,
most of them answered,

205
12:04
"I'm going to go to Heaven."
So, dualism is emmeshed.

206
12:09
A lot rests on it but,
as Crick points out;

207
12:12
the scientific consensus now is
that dualism is wrong.

208
12:18
There is no "you" separable or
separate from your body.

209
12:24
In particular,
there is no "you" separable

210
12:27
from your brain.
To put it the way cognitive

211
12:30
scientists and psychologists and
neuroscientists like to put it,

212
12:35
"the mind is what the brain
does."

213
12:37
The mind reflects the workings
of the brain just like

214
12:42
computation reflects the working
of a computer.

215
12:46
Now, why would you hold such an
outrageous view?

216
12:49
Why would you reject dualism in
favor of this alternative?

217
12:52
Well, a few reasons.
One reason is dualism has

218
12:55
always had its problems.
For one thing,

219
12:58
it's a profoundly unscientific
doctrine.

220
13:00
We want to know as curious
people how children learn

221
13:04
language, what we find
attractive or unattractive,

222
13:08
and what's the basis for mental
illness.

223
13:11
And dualism simply says,
"it's all nonphysical,

224
13:15
it's part of the ether," and
hence fails to explain it.

225
13:19
More specifically,
dualists like Descartes

226
13:22
struggle to explain how a
physical body connects to an

227
13:27
immaterial soul.
What's the conduit?

228
13:30
How could this connection be
made?

229
13:32
After all, Descartes knew full
well that there is such a

230
13:35
connection.
Your body obeys your commands.

231
13:39
If you bang your toe or stub
your toe you feel pain.

232
13:43
If you drink alcohol it affects
your reasoning,

233
13:46
but he could only wave his
hands as to how this physical

234
13:49
thing in the world could connect
to an immaterial mind.

235
13:53


236
13:57
Descartes, when he was alive,
was reasonable enough

237
14:02
concluding that physical objects
cannot do certain things.

238
14:07
He was reasonable enough in
concluding, for instance,

239
14:10
as he did, that there's no way
a merely physical object could

240
14:14
ever play a game of chess
because--and that such a

241
14:17
capacity is beyond the capacity
of the physical world and hence

242
14:21
you have to apply--you have to
extend the explanation to an

243
14:25
immaterial soul but now we
know--we have what scientists

244
14:28
call an existence proof.
We know physical objects can do

245
14:32
complicated and interesting
things.

246
14:35
We know, for instance,
machines can play chess.

247
14:38
We know machines can manipulate
symbols.

248
14:40
We know machines have limited
capacities to engage in

249
14:45
mathematical and logical
reasoning,

250
14:48
to recognize things,
to do various forms of

251
14:51
computations,
and this makes it at least

252
14:55
possible that we are such
machines.

253
14:58
So you can no longer say, "Look.
Physical things just can't do

254
15:02
that" because we know physical
things can do a lot and this

255
15:06
opens up the possibility that
humans are physical things,

256
15:10
in particular,
that humans are brains.

257
15:13
Finally, there is strong
evidence that the brain is

258
15:18
involved in mental life.
Somebody who hold a--held a

259
15:22
dualist view that said that what
we do and what we decide and

260
15:26
what we think and what we want
are all have nothing to do with

261
15:29
the physical world,
would be embarrassed by the

262
15:33
fact that the brain seems to
correspond in intricate and

263
15:37
elaborate ways to our mental
life.

264
15:40
Now, this has been known for a
long time.

265
15:44
Philosophers and psychologists
knew for a long time that

266
15:47
getting smacked in the head
could change your mental

267
15:50
faculties;
that diseases like syphilis

268
15:53
could make you deranged;
that chemicals like caffeine

269
15:57
and alcohol can affect how you
think.

270
16:00
But what's new is we can now in
different ways see the direct

271
16:03
effects of mental life.
Somebody with a severe and

272
16:08
profound loss of mental
faculties--the deficit will be

273
16:13
shown correspondingly in her
brain.

274
16:17
Studies using imaging
techniques like CAT scans,

275
16:21
PET, and fMRI,
illustrate that different parts

276
16:24
of the brain are active during
different parts of mental life.

277
16:30
For instance,
the difference between seeing

278
16:32
words, hearing words,
reading words and generating

279
16:36
words can correspond to
different aspects of what part

280
16:39
of your brain is active.
To some extent,

281
16:42
if we put you in an fMRI
scanner and observed what you're

282
16:46
doing in real time,
by looking at the activity

283
16:49
patterns in your brain we can
tell whether you are thinking

284
16:54
about music or thinking about
sex.

285
16:56
To some extent we can tell
whether you're solving a moral

286
17:00
dilemma versus something else.
And this is no surprise if what

287
17:05
we are is the workings of our
physical brains,

288
17:08
but it is extremely difficult
to explain if one is a dualist.

289
17:13
Now, so what you have is--the
scientific consensus is that all

290
17:18
of mental life including
consciousness and emotions and

291
17:22
choice and morality are the
products of brain activities.

292
17:27
So, you would expect that when
you rip open the skull and look

293
17:32
at the brain;
you'd see something glorious,

294
17:35
you'd see – I don't know –
a big, shiny thing with glass

295
17:40
tubes and blinding lights and
sparks and wonderful colors.

296
17:44
And actually though,
the brain is just disgusting.

297
17:47
It looks like an old meat loaf.
It's gray when you take it out

298
17:54
of the head.
It's called gray matter but

299
17:56
that's just because it's out of
the head.

300
17:59
Inside the head it's bright red
because it's pulsing with blood.

301
18:03
It doesn't even taste good.
Well, has anybody here ever

302
18:08
eaten brain?

303
18:09


304
18:12
It's good with cream sauce but
everything's good with cream

305
18:16
sauce.
So, the question is,

306
18:19
"How can something like this
give rise to us?"

307
18:25
And you have to have some
sympathy for Descartes.

308
18:29
There's another argument
Descartes could have made that's

309
18:31
a lot less subtle than the ones
he did make,

310
18:33
which is "That thing
responsible for free will and

311
18:37
love and consciousness?
Ridiculous."

312
18:41
What I want to do,
and what the goal of

313
18:44
neuroscience is,
is to make it less ridiculous,

314
18:47
to try to explain how the brain
works, how the brain can give

315
18:52
rise to thought,
and what I want to do today is

316
18:56
take a first stab at this
question but it's something

317
18:59
we'll continue to discuss
throughout the course as we talk

318
19:03
about different aspects of
mental life.

319
19:05
What I want to do though now is
provide a big picture.

320
19:09
So, what I want to do is start
off small, with the smallest

321
19:12
interesting part of the brain
and then get bigger and bigger

322
19:16
and bigger – talk about how
the small part of the brain,

323
19:19
the neurons,
the basic building blocks of

324
19:22
thought, combine to other mental
structures and into different

325
19:25
subparts of the brain and
finally to the whole thing.

326
19:28
So, one of the discoveries of
psychology is that the basic

327
19:35
unit of the brain appears to be
the neuron.

328
19:40
The neuron is a specific sort
of cell and the neuron has three

329
19:44
major parts, as you could see
illustrated here.

330
19:47
Neurons actually look quite
different from one another but

331
19:50
this is a typical one.
There are the dendrites –

332
19:54
these little tentacles here.
And the dendrites get signals

333
19:59
from other neurons.
Now, these signals can be

334
20:03
either excitatory,
which is that they raise the

335
20:06
likelihood the neuron will fire,
or inhibitory in that they

336
20:10
lower the likelihood that the
neuron will fire.

337
20:13
The cell body sums it up and
you could view it

338
20:16
arithmetically.
The excitatory signals are

339
20:19
pluses, the inhibitory ones are
minuses.

340
20:23
And then if you get a certain
number, plus 60 or something,

341
20:27
the neuron will fire and it
fires along the axon,

342
20:30
the thing to the right.
The axon is much longer than

343
20:34
the dendrites and,
in fact, some axons are many

344
20:38
feet long.
There's an axon leading from

345
20:41
your spinal cord to your big toe
for instance.

346
20:45
It is so shocking the lights go
out.

347
20:50
Surrounded--Surrounding--To
complete a mechanical metaphor

348
20:54
that would have led Descartes to
despair-- Thank you,

349
20:58
Koleen.
Surrounding the axon is a

350
21:00
myelin sheath,
which is actually just

351
21:03
insulation.
It helps the firing work

352
21:06
quicker.
So, here are some facts about

353
21:09
neurons.
There are a lot of them –

354
21:12
about one thousand billion of
them – and each neuron can be

355
21:16
connected to around thousands,
perhaps tens of thousands,

356
21:20
other neurons.
So, it's an extraordinarily

357
21:24
complicated computing device.
Neurons come in three flavors.

358
21:29
There are sensory neurons,
which take information from the

359
21:32
world so as you see me,
for instance,

360
21:34
there are neurons firing from
your retina sending signals to

361
21:38
your brain.
There are motor neurons.

362
21:41
If you decide to raise your
hand, those are motor neurons

363
21:45
telling the muscles what to do.
And there are interneurons

364
21:49
which connect the two.
And basically,

365
21:52
the interneurons do the
thinking.

366
21:54
They make the connection
between sensation and action.

367
21:58
It used to be believed,
and it's the sort of thing I

368
22:02
would--when I taught this course
many years ago I would lecture

369
22:06
on--that neurons do not grow
back once you lose them.

370
22:10
You never get them back.
This is actually not true.

371
22:13
There are parts of the brain in
which neurons can re-grow.

372
22:17
One interesting thing about
neurons is a neuron is like a

373
22:22
gun.
It either fires or it doesn't.

374
22:25
It's all or nothing.
If you squeeze the trigger of a

375
22:29
gun really hard and really fast,
it doesn't fire any faster or

376
22:33
harder than if you just squeezed
it gently.

377
22:36
Now, this seems to be strange.
How could neurons be all or

378
22:41
nothing when sensation is very
graded?

379
22:45
If somebody next to you pushed
on your hand--the degree of

380
22:49
pushing--you'd be able to notice
it.

381
22:51
It's not either pushing or not
pushing.

382
22:53
You can--Degrees of pushing,
degrees of heat,

383
22:56
degrees of brightness.
And the answer is,

384
22:59
although neurons are all or
nothing, there are ways to code

385
23:02
intensity.
So, one simple way to code

386
23:04
intensity is the number of
neurons firing;

387
23:07
the more neurons the more
intense.

388
23:11
Another way to increase
intensity is the frequency of

389
23:18
firing.
So, I'll just use those two.

390
23:23
The first one is the number of
neurons firing.

391
23:25
The second one is the frequency
of firing in that something is

392
23:29
more intense if it's "bang,
bang, bang, bang,

393
23:32
bang, bang" then "bang,
bang, bang" and these are two

394
23:36
ways through which neurons
encode intensity.

395
23:40
Now, neurons are connected and
they talk to one another and it

396
23:45
used to be thought they were
tied to one another like a

397
23:49
computer,
like you take wires and you

398
23:52
connect wires to each other,
you wrap them around and

399
23:54
connect them.
It turns out this isn't the

400
23:57
case.
It turns out that neurons

401
23:59
relate to one another chemically
in a kind of interesting way.

402
24:03
Between any neurons,
between the axon of one neuron

403
24:06
and the dendrite of another,
there's a tiny gap.

404
24:10
The gap could be about one
ten-thousandths of a millimeter

405
24:14
wide.
This infinitesimal gap--and

406
24:16
this gap is known as a
synapse--and what happens is

407
24:20
when a neuron fires,
an axon sends chemicals

408
24:23
shooting through the gap.
These chemicals are known as

409
24:27
neurotransmitters and they
affect the dendrites.

410
24:30
So, neurons communicate to one
another chemically.

411
24:33
These--Again,
the chemicals could excite the

412
24:37
other neuron (excitatory) bring
up the chances it will fire,

413
24:42
or inhibit the other neuron
(inhibitory).

414
24:46
Now, neurotransmitters become
interesting because a lot of

415
24:52
psychopharmacology,
both of the medical sort and

416
24:56
the recreational sort,
consists of fiddling with

417
25:00
neurotransmitters and so you
could see this through some

418
25:04
examples.
There are two sorts of ways you

419
25:07
could fiddle with
neurotransmitters,

420
25:10
and correspondingly two sorts
of drugs.

421
25:13
There are agonists.
And what an agonist does is

422
25:16
increases the effect of
neurotransmitters,

423
25:19
either by making more
neurotransmitters or stopping

424
25:23
the cleanup of
neurotransmitters,

425
25:26
or in some cases by faking a
neurotransmitter,

426
25:28
by mimicking its effects.
Then, there are antagonists

427
25:31
that slow down the amount of
neurotransmitters,

428
25:34
either because they destroy
neurotransmitters or they make

429
25:38
it hard to create more.
Or in some cases they go to the

430
25:41
dendrite of the neuron and they
kind of put a paste over it so

431
25:45
that the neurotransmitters can't
connect.

432
25:47
And it's through these clever
ways that neurons can affect

433
25:51
your mental life.

434
25:53


435
25:56
So, for instance,
there is a drug known as Curare

436
26:03
and Curare is an antagonist.
It's a very particular sort of

437
26:10
antagonist.
It blocks motor neurons from

438
26:14
affecting muscle fibers.
What this does then is it

439
26:18
paralyzes you because your motor
neurons--You send the command to

440
26:22
your arm to stand,
to lift up.

441
26:25
It doesn't work.
You send the command to your

442
26:27
leg to move.
It doesn't work.

443
26:29
The motor neurons are
deactivated and then,

444
26:33
because the way you breathe is
through motor neurons,

445
26:37
you then die.
There's alcohol.

446
26:40
Alcohol is inhibitory.
Now, this may be puzzling to

447
26:44
people.
It's mildly paradoxical because

448
26:47
you may be thinking,
"alcohol is not inhibitory.

449
26:50
On the contrary,
when I drink a lot of alcohol I

450
26:53
lose my inhibitions and become a
more fun person.

451
26:56
I become more aggressive and
more sexually vibrant and simply

452
27:01
more beautiful.
And so in what way is alcohol

453
27:06
inhibitory?"
Well, the answer is it inhibits

454
27:11
the inhibitory parts of your
brain.

455
27:15
So, you have parts of your
brain that are basically telling

456
27:17
you now, largely in the frontal
lobes, that are--"Okay.

457
27:20
Keep your pants on.
Don't hit me, buddy.

458
27:23
Don't use bad words."
Alcohol relaxes,

459
27:26
shuts down those parts of the
brain.

460
27:30
If you take enough alcohol,
it then goes down to inhibit

461
27:33
the excitatory parts of your
brain and then you fall on the

462
27:37
floor and pass out.
Amphetamines increase the

463
27:41
amount of arousal.
In particular,

464
27:45
they increase the amount of
norepinephrine,

465
27:48
a neurotransmitter that's
responsible for just general

466
27:52
arousal.
And so, amphetamines include

467
27:56
drugs like "speed" and "coke."
There are--Prozac works on

468
28:04
serotonin.
When we discuss clinical

469
28:08
psychology and depression we'll
learn the extent to which

470
28:12
neurotransmitter disorders are
implicated in certain disorders

471
28:16
like depression.
And one problem is that – for

472
28:20
depression – is that there's
too little of a neurotransmitter

473
28:25
known as serotonin.
Prozac makes serotonin more

474
28:30
prevalent and so in some extent
might help alleviate depression.

475
28:36
Parkinson's disease is a
disease involving destruction of

476
28:40
motor control and loss of motor
control, difficulty moving.

477
28:44
And one factor in Parkinson's
is too little of a

478
28:47
neurotransmitter known as
dopamine.

479
28:50
The drug L-DOPA increases the
supply of dopamine and so there

480
28:54
is something to alleviate,
at least temporarily,

481
28:57
the symptoms of Parkinson's.
So, you have neurons and

482
29:01
they're clustered together and
they fire and they communicate

483
29:04
to one another.
So, how does this all work to

484
29:07
give rise to creatures who could
do interesting things like talk

485
29:11
and think?
Well, again,

486
29:13
it used to be believed that the
brain is wired up like a

487
29:17
computer,
like a PC or a Mac or something

488
29:20
like that, but we know this
can't be true.

489
29:23
It can't be true because
there's two ways in which the

490
29:26
brain is better than a computer.
For one thing,

491
29:30
the brain is highly resistant
to damage.

492
29:35
If you have a laptop and I
persuade you to open it up for

493
29:40
me and I take the pliers and
kind of snip just about

494
29:44
anywhere,
your laptop will be destroyed

495
29:47
but the brain is actually more
resilient.

496
29:50
You can take a lot of brain
damage and still preserve some

497
29:54
mental functioning.
To some interesting sense,

498
29:57
there's some sort of damage
resistance built in to the brain

499
30:00
that allows different parts of
the brain to take over if some

500
30:04
parts are damaged.
A second consideration is the

501
30:08
brain is extremely fast.
Your computer works on wires

502
30:12
and electricity but your brain
uses tissue and tissue is

503
30:18
extremely slow.
The paradox then is how do you

504
30:22
create such a fast computer with
such slow stuff?

505
30:25
And you can't.
If the brain was wired up like

506
30:28
a personal computer,
it would take you four hours to

507
30:31
recognize a face but,
in fact, we could do things

508
30:35
extremely quickly.
So, the question then is how is

509
30:38
the brain wired up?
And the answer is,

510
30:41
unlike manys,
unlike commercially generated

511
30:44
computers, the brain works
through parallel processing,

512
30:49
massively parallel distributed
processing.

513
30:52
There's a whole lot of research
and this is research,

514
30:55
some of which takes place
outside psychology departments

515
30:58
and in engineering departments
and computer science

516
31:01
departments,
trying to figure out how a

517
31:04
computer can do the same things
brains can do.

518
31:09
And one way people do this is
they take a hint from nature and

519
31:13
they try to construct massively
distributed networks to do

520
31:17
aspects of reasoning.
So, there's a very simple

521
31:21
computational network.
That is interesting because it

522
31:25
kind of looks to some extent
like the way neurons look and

523
31:28
this is often known as neural
networks.

524
31:31
And people who study this often
claim to be studying neural

525
31:35
network modeling to try to build
smart machines by modeling them

526
31:39
after brains.
And in the last 20 years or so,

527
31:43
this has been a huge and
vibrant area of study where

528
31:46
people are trying to wire up
machines that can do brain-like

529
31:50
things from components that look
a lot like neurons and are wired

530
31:54
up together as neurons are.
One consideration in all of

531
31:58
this is that this is a very
young field and nobody knows how

532
32:03
to do it yet.
There is no machine yet that

533
32:07
can recognize faces or
understand sentences at the

534
32:11
level of a two-year-old human.
There is no machine yet that

535
32:15
can do just about anything
people can do in an interesting

536
32:18
way.
And this is,

537
32:19
in part, because the human
brain is wired up in an

538
32:22
extraordinarily more complicated
way than any sort of simple

539
32:25
neural network.
This is a sort of schematic

540
32:29
diagram – you're not
responsible for this – of

541
32:33
parts of the visual cortex,
and the thing to realize about

542
32:37
this is it's extraordinarily
simplified.

543
32:40
So, the brain is a complicated
system.

544
32:43
Now, so, we've talked a little
bit about the basic building

545
32:48
blocks of the brain – neurons.
We've then talked about how

546
32:52
neurons can communicate to one
another;

547
32:54
then, turned to how neurons are
wired up together.

548
32:59
Now let's talk a little bit
about different parts of the

549
33:02
brain.
Now, there's some things you

550
33:04
don't actually need your brain
to do.

551
33:07
The study of what you don't
need your brain to do has often

552
33:10
drawn upon this weird
methodology where--This was

553
33:13
actually done in France a lot
where they would decapitate

554
33:16
people and when--After they
decapitated people,

555
33:20
psychologists would rush to the
body of the headless person and

556
33:23
sort of just test out reflexes
and stuff like that.

557
33:26
It's kind of gruesome but we
know there are some things you

558
33:29
don't need your brain for.
You don't need your brain for

559
33:33
newborn sucking,
limb flexation in withdrawal

560
33:37
from pain.
Your limbs will pull back even

561
33:40
if your head is gone.
Erection of the penis can be

562
33:43
done without a brain.
Vomiting also is done without a

563
33:46
brain.
Oh.

564
33:47
I need a volunteer.
Very simple.

565
33:52
This will not involve any
of--excellent--any of the above.

566
33:54
Could you stand up just--Okay.
This is a new shirt so I want

567
33:59
to stay away.
Just--No.

568
34:00
This is--If you'll hold out
your hand and--one hand flat.

569
34:05
Excellent.
That's the textbook,

570
34:07
5th edition.
Now.

571
34:10
Perfect.
What you'll notice is--Thank

572
34:13
you very much.
What you'll notice is this hit

573
34:16
and this hand went back up.
This is something automatic,

574
34:20
instinctive,
and does not require your

575
34:22
brain.
So your brain isn't needed for

576
34:25
everything.
What does your brain do?

577
34:28
Well, some things that your
brain does involve very

578
34:31
low-level internal structures.
And these are called

579
34:34
subcortical structures because
they're below the cortex.

580
34:38
They're underneath the cortex.
So, for instance,

581
34:41
what we have here is a diagram
of the brain.

582
34:44
The way to read this diagram is
it's as if it were my brain and

583
34:48
I am facing this way.
My head gets cut in half down

584
34:52
here and then you could see the
brain.

585
34:56
So, this is the front over here.
That's the back.

586
35:00
Some key parts are illustrated
here.

587
35:02
The medulla,
for instance,

588
35:05
is responsible for heart rate
and respiration.

589
35:09
It's very deep within the brain
and if it gets damaged you

590
35:13
could--you are likely to die.
The cerebellum is responsible

591
35:17
for body balance and muscular
coordination.

592
35:21
And to give you,
again, a feeling for the

593
35:23
complexity of these systems,
the cerebellum contains

594
35:26
approximately 30 billion
neurons.

595
35:29
The hypothalamus is responsible
here for feeding,

596
35:33
hunger, thirst,
and to some extent sleep.

597
35:37
And here is the same brain
parts in close-up.

598
35:41
Now, all of these parts of the
brains are essential and many of

599
35:47
them are implicated in
interesting psychological

600
35:50
processes but where the action
is is the cortex.

601
35:55
Isn't this beautiful?
The cortex is the outer layer

602
35:59
and the outer layer is all
crumpled up.

603
36:02
Do you ever wonder why your
brain looks wrinkled?

604
36:05
That's because it's all
crumpled.

605
36:08
If you took out somebody's
cortex and flattened it out,

606
36:12
it would be two feet square,
sort of like a nice--like a

607
36:17
rug.
And the cortex is where all the

608
36:21
neat stuff takes place.
Fish don't have any of that,

609
36:26
so no offense to fish but
it's--fish don't have much of a

610
36:29
mental life.
Reptiles and birds have a

611
36:32
little bit about it--of it--and
primates have a lot and humans

612
36:36
have a real lot.
Eighty percent of the volume of

613
36:40
our brain, about,
is cortex.

614
36:42
And the cortex can be broken up
into different parts or lobes.

615
36:50
There is the--And,
again, this is facing in

616
36:53
profile forward.
There is the frontal lobe,

617
36:56
easy to remember.
This part in front,

618
36:59
the parietal lobe,
the occipital lobe,

619
37:03
and the temporal lobe.
And one theme we're going to

620
37:08
return to is--this is half the
brain.

621
37:10
This is, in fact,
the left half of the brain.

622
37:15
On the other half,
the right half,

623
37:17
everything's duplicated with
some slight and subtle

624
37:20
differences.
What's really weird--One really

625
37:24
weird finding about these lobes
is that they include topological

626
37:29
maps.
They include maps of your body.

627
37:33
There is a cartoon which
actually illustrates a classic

628
37:36
experiment by some physiologists
who for some reason had a dog's

629
37:41
brain opened up and started
shocking different parts of the

630
37:45
brain.
You could do brain surgery

631
37:47
while fully conscious because
the brain itself has no sense

632
37:50
organs to it.
And it turns out that the

633
37:53
dog--When they zapped part of
its brain, its leg would kick

634
37:56
up.
And it took Dr.

635
37:57
Penfield at McGill University
to do the same thing with

636
38:02
people.
So, they were doing some brain

637
38:04
surgery.
He had a little electrical

638
38:06
thing just on--I don't know how
he thought to do this.

639
38:09
He started zapping it and
"boom."

640
38:11
The person--Parts of their body
would move.

641
38:14
More than that,
when he zapped other parts of

642
38:17
the brain, people would claim to
see colors.

643
38:21
And he zapped other parts of
the brain;

644
38:22
people would claim to hear
sounds;

645
38:25
and other parts of the brain,
people would claim to

646
38:29
experience touch.
And through his research and

647
38:33
other research,
it was found that there are

648
38:36
maps in the brain of the body.
There is a map in the motor

649
38:41
part of the brain,
the motor cortex,

650
38:44
of the sort up on the left and
the sensory cortex of the sort

651
38:48
that you could see on the right
and if you--and you could tell

652
38:52
what's what by opening up the
brain and shocking different

653
38:56
parts and those parts would
correspond to the parts of the

654
39:01
body shown in the diagram there.
Now, two things to notice about

655
39:06
these maps.
The first is they're

656
39:09
topographical and what this
means is that if two parts of

657
39:13
the--two parts are close
together on the body,

658
39:16
they'll be close together on
the brain.

659
39:19
So, your tongue is closer to
your jaw than it is to your hip

660
39:25
in the body;
so too in both the motor cortex

661
39:29
and the somatosensory cortex.
Also, you'll notice that the

662
39:34
size of the body part
represented in the brain does

663
39:37
not correspond to the size of
the body part in the real world.

664
39:42
Rather, what determines the
size in the brain is the extent

665
39:46
to which either they have motor
command over it or sensory

666
39:51
control.
So, there's a whole lot of

667
39:53
sensory organs,
for instance,

668
39:55
focused along your tongue,
and that's why that's so big,

669
39:58
and an enormous amount on your
face but your shoulder isn't

670
40:02
even--doesn't even make it on
there because,

671
40:05
although your shoulder might be
bigger than your tongue,

672
40:07
there's not much going on.
In fact, if you draw a diagram

673
40:11
of a person, what their body is
corresponding to the amount of

674
40:16
somatosensory cortex,
you get something like that.

675
40:20
That's your sensory body.

676
40:22


677
40:28
Now, so, you have these maps in
your head but the thing to

678
40:32
realize is--And these maps are
part of your cortex,

679
40:35
but the things to realize is
that's an important part of what

680
40:40
goes on in your brain but less
than one quarter of the cortex

681
40:45
contains these maps or
projection areas.

682
40:48
The rest is involved in
language and reasoning and moral

683
40:53
thought and so on.
And, in fact,

684
40:55
the proportion as you go from
rat, cat, and monkey,

685
40:58
humans--less and less of it is
devoted to projection and there

686
41:02
is more and more to other
things.

687
41:04
So, how do we figure out what
the other parts of the brain do?

688
41:11
Well, there's all sorts of
methods.

689
41:12
Typically, these are recent
imaging methods like CAT scan

690
41:18
and PET scan and fMRI which,
as I said before,

691
41:22
show parts of your brain at
work.

692
41:25
If you want to know which part
of your brain is responsible for

693
41:30
language, you could put somebody
into a scanner and have them

694
41:35
exposed to language or do a
linguistic task or talk or

695
41:40
something and then see what
parts of their brain are active.

696
41:45
Another way to explore what the
brain does is to consider what

697
41:49
happens to people when very bad
things happen to their brain.

698
41:54
And these bad things could
happen through lesions,

699
41:58
through tumors,
through strokes,

700
42:00
through injury.
For the most part,

701
42:03
neuropsychologists don't like
helmet laws.

702
42:06
Neuropsychologists love when
motorcyclists drive without

703
42:09
helmets because through their
horrible accidents we gain great

704
42:12
insights into how the brain
works.

705
42:15
And the logic is if you find
somebody--Crudely,

706
42:18
if you find somebody with
damage to this part of the brain

707
42:21
right here and that person can't
recognize faces for instance,

708
42:26
there's some reason to believe
that this part of the brain is

709
42:29
related to face recognition.
And so, from the study of brain

710
42:33
damage and the study of--we can
gain some understanding of what

711
42:38
different parts of the brain do.
And so, people study brain

712
42:43
damages--brain damage that
implicates motor control such as

713
42:48
apraxia.
And what's interesting about

714
42:51
apraxia is it's not paralysis.
Somebody with apraxia can move,

715
42:55
do simple movements just fine
but they can't coordinate their

716
42:58
movements.
They can't do something like

717
43:01
wave goodbye or light a
cigarette.

718
43:03
There is agnosia and agnosia is
a disorder which isn't blindness

719
43:07
because the person could still
see perfectly well.

720
43:10
Their eyes are intact but
rather what happens in agnosia

721
43:15
is they lose the ability to
recognize certain things.

722
43:20
Sometimes this is described as
psychic blindness.

723
43:23
And so, they may get visual
agnosia and lose the ability to

724
43:26
recognize objects.
They may get prosopagnosia and

725
43:30
lose the ability to recognize
faces.

726
43:34
There are disorders of sensory
neglect, some famous disorders.

727
43:39
Again, it's not paralysis,
it's not blindness,

728
43:41
but due to certain parts of
your--of damaged parts of your

729
43:45
brain,
you might lose,

730
43:46
for instance,
the idea that there's a left

731
43:49
side of your body or a left side
of the world.

732
43:53
And these cases are so
interesting I want to devote

733
43:56
some chunk to a class in the
next few weeks to discussing

734
43:59
them.
There are disorders of language

735
44:02
like aphasia.
The classic case was discovered

736
44:06
by Paul Broca in 1861.
A patient who had damage to

737
44:10
part of his brain and can only
say one word,

738
44:14
"tan,"
and the person would say,

739
44:17
"tan, tan, tan,
tan," and everything else was

740
44:22
gone.
There's other disorders of

741
44:24
language such as receptive
aphasia where the person could

742
44:28
speak very fluently but the
words don't make any sense and

743
44:31
they can't understand anybody
else.

744
44:34
Other disorders that we'll
discuss later on include

745
44:37
acquired psychopathy,
where damage to parts of your

746
44:40
brain,
particularly related to the

747
44:42
frontal lobes,
rob you of the ability to tell

748
44:46
right from wrong.
The final--I want to end--We're

749
44:49
talking about neurons,
connection between neurons,

750
44:52
how neurons are wired up,
the parts of the brain,

751
44:55
what the different parts do.
I want to end by talking about

752
44:58
the two halves of the brain and
ask the question,

753
45:02
"How many minds do you have?"
Now, if you look at the

754
45:05
brain--If you took the brain out
and held it up,

755
45:09
it would look pretty
symmetrical, but it actually is

756
45:12
not.
There are actual differences

757
45:14
between the right hemisphere and
the left hemisphere.

758
45:18
How many people here are
right-handed?

759
45:23
How many people here are
left-handed?

760
45:28
How many people here are sort
of complicated,

761
45:31
ambidextrous,
don't know, "bit of the right,

762
45:34
bit of left" people?
Okay.

763
45:36
Those of you who are
right-handed,

764
45:39
which comprises about nine out
of ten people,

765
45:43
have language in your left
hemisphere.

766
45:46
And, in fact,
we're going to be talking about

767
45:48
right-handed people for the most
part, making generalizations in

768
45:51
what I'll talk about now.
Those of you who are

769
45:54
left-handed are more
complicated.

770
45:57
Some of you have language in
your right hemisphere,

771
45:59
some in your left hemisphere,
some God knows where.

772
46:02
It's complicated.
Now, the idea is that some

773
46:05
things are duplicated.
So, if you were to lose half

774
46:09
your brain, the other half can
actually do a lot but some

775
46:13
things are more prevalent and
more powerful in one part of the

776
46:16
brain than the other.
And I want to show you a brief

777
46:19
film clip from "Scientific
American" that illustrates the

778
46:22
differences between the
hemispheres,

779
46:24
but before doing that,
I want to provide some

780
46:27
introductory facts.
Some functions are lateralized.

781
46:30
So, typically,
language in the left.

782
46:32
Again, this is a right-handed
centric thing but if you're

783
46:36
right-handed – language on the
left, math and music on the

784
46:40
right.
There is a crossover and this

785
46:42
is important when we think about
the studies that will follow but

786
46:45
the crossover is that everything
you see in the left visual field

787
46:49
goes to the right side of your
brain;

788
46:51
everything in the right visual
field goes to the left side of

789
46:54
the brain, and similarly,
there's a crossover in action.

790
46:58
So, your right hemisphere
controls the left side of the

791
47:00
body.
Your left hemisphere controls

792
47:02
the right side of the body.
Now, finally,

793
47:05
the two halves are connected.
They're connected by this huge

794
47:12
web called the corpus callosum.
And I'm just going to skip this

795
47:19
because the movie illustration
will go through some of this.

796
47:23


797
47:26
This illustrates certain themes
that are discussed in detail in

798
47:30
the Gray book,
concerning the lateralization

799
47:33
of different parts of different
mental capacities,

800
47:37
some in the left hemisphere,
some in the right hemisphere.

801
47:39
But it also serves as a useful
methodological development,

802
47:45
which is a nice illustration as
to how looking at people who are

803
47:50
incredibly unusual,
such as this man who had his

804
47:54
brain bisected so his left
hemisphere and his right

805
47:57
hemisphere don't communicate
with one another--how looking at

806
48:00
such people,
such extreme cases,

807
48:03
can provide us with some
understanding of how we normally

808
48:07
do things.
And this, again,

809
48:09
is a theme we'll return to
throughout the course.

810
48:12
This is generally the general
introduction of the brain that I

811
48:16
wanted to provide,
giving the framework for what

812
48:19
I'll be talking about later on
throughout the course so that I

813
48:23
might later on make reference to
neurons or neurotransmitters or

814
48:26
the cortex or the left
hemisphere and you'll sort of

815
48:29
have the background to
understand what I'm talking

816
48:32
about.
But I want to end this first

817
48:35
real class with a bit of
humility as to what

818
48:40
psychologists know and don't
know.

819
48:44
So, the idea behind a lot of
psychology – particularly a

820
48:47
lot of neuroscience and
cognitive psychology – is to

821
48:50
treat the mind as an information
processor,

822
48:52
as an elaborate computer.
And so, we study different

823
48:57
problems like recognizing faces
or language or motor control or

824
49:03
logic.
The strategy then often is to

825
49:06
figure out how,
what sort of program can solve

826
49:09
these problems and then we go on
to ask,

827
49:12
"How could this program be
instantiated in the physical

828
49:18
brain?"
So, we would solve--We study

829
49:21
people much as we'd study a
computer from an alien planet or

830
49:25
something.
And I think--This strategy is

831
49:28
one I'm very enthusiastic about
but there still remains what's

832
49:32
sometimes called the "hard
problem" of consciousness and

833
49:37
this involves subjective
experience.

834
49:40
What's it like?
So, my computer can play chess.

835
49:46
My computer can recognize
numbers.

836
49:50
It can do math.
And maybe it does it kind of

837
49:53
the same way that I do it but my
computer doesn't have feelings

838
49:58
in the same sense.
These are two classic

839
50:01
illustrations.
This is from a very old "Star

840
50:04
Trek" episode.
It illustrates angst.

841
50:06
I think a starship's about to
go into the sun or something.

842
50:09
And that's my older kid,
Max, who's happy.

843
50:14
And so the question is,
"How does a thing like that

844
50:18
give rise to consciousness and
subjective experience?"

845
50:21
And this is a deep puzzle.
And although some psychologists

846
50:25
and philosophers think they've
solved it, most of us are a lot

847
50:29
more skeptical.
Most of us think we have so far

848
50:32
to go before we can answer
questions like Huxley's

849
50:35
question.
Huxley points out,

850
50:37
"How it is that anything so
remarkable as a state of

851
50:40
consciousness comes about as a
result of irritating nervous

852
50:43
tissue,
is just as unaccountable as the

853
50:45
appearance of the Djinn…" –
of the genie – "…when

854
50:48
Aladdin rubs his lamp."
It seems like magic that a

855
50:52
fleshy lump of gray,
disgusting meat can give rise

856
50:55
to these feelings.
The second bit of humility

857
50:59
we'll end the class on is I am
presenting here,

858
51:01
and I'll be presenting
throughout this semester,

859
51:04
what you can call a mechanistic
conception of mental life.

860
51:08
I'm not going to be talking
about how beautiful it is and

861
51:10
how wonderful it is and how
mysterious it is.

862
51:12
Rather, I'm going to be trying
to explain it.

863
51:14
I'm going to be trying to
explain fundamental aspects of

864
51:17
ourselves including questions
like how do we make decisions,

865
51:21
why do we love our children,
what happens when we fall in

866
51:25
love, and so on.
Now, you might find this sort

867
51:29
of project in the end to be
repellant.

868
51:33
You might worry about how this,
well, this meshes with humanist

869
51:38
values.
For instance,

870
51:39
when we deal with one another
in a legal and a moral setting,

871
51:43
we think in terms of free will
and responsibility.

872
51:46
If we're driving and you cut me
off, you chose to do that.

873
51:50
It reflects badly on you.
If you save a life at risk to

874
51:54
your own, you're--you deserve
praise.

875
51:56
You did something wonderful.
It might be hard to mesh this

876
52:01
with the conception in which all
actions are the result of

877
52:04
neurochemical physical
processes.

878
52:06
It might also be hard to mesh a
notion such as the purported

879
52:10
intrinsic value of people.
And finally,

880
52:13
it might be hard to mesh the
mechanistic notion of the mind

881
52:17
with the idea that people have
spiritual value.

882
52:21
Faced with this tension,
there are three possibilities.

883
52:25
You might choose to reject the
scientific conception of the

884
52:28
mind.
Many people do.

885
52:30
You may choose to embrace
dualism, reject the idea that

886
52:33
the brain is responsible for
mental life, and reject the

887
52:37
promise of a scientific
psychology.

888
52:39
Alternatively,
you might choose to embrace the

889
52:42
scientific worldview and reject
all these humanist values.

890
52:46
And there are some philosophers
and psychologists who do just

891
52:49
that, who claim that free will
and responsibility and spiritual

892
52:53
value and intrinsic value are
all illusions;

893
52:56
they're pre-scientific notions
that get washed away in modern

894
53:00
science or you could try to
reconcile them.

895
53:04
You could try to figure out how
to mesh your scientific view of

896
53:08
the mind with these humanist
values you might want to

897
53:11
preserve.
And this is an issue which

898
53:13
we're going to return to
throughout the course.

899
53:15
Okay.
I'll see you on Wednesday.
