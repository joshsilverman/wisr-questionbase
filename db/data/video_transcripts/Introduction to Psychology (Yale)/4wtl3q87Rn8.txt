Professor Paul Bloom:
The final topic of the course

2
0:16
is clinical psychology,
also known as abnormal

3
0:18
psychology or psychopathology,
and this, for many of us,

4
0:22
is what psychology is really
about.

5
0:24
It's about mental illness.
It's about clinical

6
0:26
psychologists.

7
0:27


8
0:30
And we started talking about
this when Dr.

9
0:34
Nolen-Hoeksema gave her guest
lecture last week and I want to

10
0:38
continue through this today.
It is a topic of tremendous

11
0:43
scientific importance but also a
topic of great personal

12
0:47
importance for many of us.
Many of the people in this room

13
0:52
have been mentally ill,
strictly speaking,

14
0:55
at some point in their lives.
Some of you are under some sort

15
1:00
of therapy or treatment or
medical intervention right now.

16
1:05
Some of you are on Prozac or
Zoloft or Ambien or Wellbutrin

17
1:10
or any of those other
medications to deal with

18
1:13
psychological problems you are
facing.

19
1:16
Others are also talking to
psychiatrists,

20
1:20
psychologists,
social workers,

21
1:22
and other people.
Many of you who are not at this

22
1:27
point mentally ill will become
mentally ill during your stay at

23
1:31
Yale.
[laughter]

24
1:33
And this is a difficult period
in many people's lives and it's

25
1:38
a period of people's lives where
mental illness emerges in many

26
1:42
of us.
By one estimate,

27
1:44
one half of all college
graduates in the United States

28
1:47
– and the number is very high
with college graduates,

29
1:50
highly educated people – one
half of you will have some sort

30
1:56
of mental illness in your life
serious enough to require some

31
2:01
sort of treatment.
Those of you not directly

32
2:05
affected with mental illness
yourselves will no doubt

33
2:10
experience your loved ones,
your family,

34
2:14
your friends getting some sort
of illness, be it Alzheimer's or

35
2:18
schizophrenia or depression or
some sort of anxiety disorder.

36
2:23
So the personal importance of
clinical psychology,

37
2:26
the personal importance of
understanding what can go wrong

38
2:30
and how best to treat it,
simply can't be underestimated.

39
2:35
Now, when we talk about mental
disorders, the scope of this is

40
2:39
very broad.
It includes the prototypical

41
2:42
schizophrenic which you could
see on the streets of New Haven,

42
2:46
somebody walking and gesturing
and talking to themselves and

43
2:49
sometimes screaming.
It includes alcohol addiction

44
2:53
and cocaine addiction and other
addictions.

45
2:57
It includes somebody with Down
syndrome or autism,

46
3:01
an old person losing his
memory,

47
3:04
a teenager falling into a deep
depression, somebody with a

48
3:07
severe social phobia to the
extent that he or she can't

49
3:10
leave the house.
Then there are also very hard

50
3:14
cases where it's difficult to
say one way or another--that

51
3:18
guy's photographing me as I'm
talking and it's freaking me out

52
3:22
[laughs]
[laughter]

53
3:23
in kind of a social phobia way.
There's difficult cases where

54
3:29
it's just hard to tell mental
illness from just bad behavior

55
3:34
in general.
So, consider a killer without a

56
3:39
conscience or a mobster like
John Gotti.

57
3:44
Is he mentally ill?
And this is a question which is

58
3:48
a deep one and we'll wrestle
with it a little bit actually

59
3:50
towards the end of this lecture.
What about somebody who acts in

60
3:55
a kind of unusual or zany way?
This is originally supposed to

61
3:59
be a picture of the character
Kramer on "Seinfeld" but,

62
4:03
given his unusual antics in the
last few months,

63
4:05
it could be a picture of the
actor who plays him who got into

64
4:08
all sorts of trouble.
What about someone who is just

65
4:11
kind of wacky?
At what point does wackiness

66
4:13
move into the domain of mental
illness?

67
4:16
What about unusual lifestyles
such as extreme altruism?

68
4:21
Batman devotes most of his life
to helping others.

69
4:26
He sleeps one hour a night and
this hour is fraught with

70
4:30
nightmares and then he fights
crime.

71
4:33
What about somebody,
and this was a case reported in

72
4:35
The New Yorker a few
months ago,

73
4:37
who has lots of money and a
loving family and has his kidney

74
4:43
removed to help a stranger?
And he says,

75
4:46
"I have two kidneys.
It's minor pain,

76
4:49
a minor operation.
I could save someone's life."

77
4:51
And his wife says,
"You're mentally ill.

78
4:54
That's just crazy to do that."
Where do we draw the line?

79
4:59
And so, there are these great
philosophical and moral

80
5:02
questions over the boundaries
and how to think about mental

81
5:05
illness.
So, how should we think about

82
5:08
mental illness?
Well, there are some answers we

83
5:11
could quickly dispense with.
It used to be thought that

84
5:14
severe mental illness was a
result of demonic possession.

85
5:18
If you read the Gospels,
Jesus Christ wandered around a

86
5:21
lot, met crazy people and
exorcised the demons from their

87
5:25
bodies.
It was a common way of thinking

88
5:27
about craziness.
We now believe that this is not

89
5:30
true.
What about--yeah, it's not true.

90
5:35
What about social deviants?
Some people including the

91
5:40
psychiatrist Thomas Szasz claim
that when we label somebody as

92
5:45
mentally ill this is not a
medical decision.

93
5:49
It's rather a social decision
designed to ostracize people who

94
5:54
deviate from society's norms,
to ostracize them and rid them

95
5:59
of moral agency.
It's not that we disagree with

96
6:03
them.
It's not even that we see them

97
6:05
as evil.
Rather, we see them as sick and

98
6:07
as such we don't even have to
accord to them the respect that

99
6:12
we accord to criminals.
Now, this is not entirely an

100
6:17
unreasonable view.
In many countries around the

101
6:21
world, dissidents,
people who argue against the

102
6:26
state, are often determined to
be mentally ill and thrown in

103
6:31
asylums.
Blacks in the United States who

104
6:35
tried to escape from slavery
were described as having a

105
6:39
mental illness.
Why would they want to do so

106
6:42
unless they were mentally ill?
Up until 1973,

107
6:45
to be a homosexual,
to be gay, would count in the

108
6:50
official records of how we
classify illness as being

109
6:56
mentally ill.
And many people saw this,

110
7:00
and we see this now,
not so much as reflecting a

111
7:04
sort of unbiased medical
analysis but rather as

112
7:08
reflecting biases that people
have against gay people.

113
7:13
And these are political and
social and moral biases.

114
7:16
They are not objective medical
judgments.

115
7:19
Even now I've been recording
every president that has been

116
7:24
the president of the United
States in my memory including

117
7:28
Bush and particularly Clinton
has been described by his

118
7:33
opponents not merely as awful,
evil, terrible,

119
7:37
"hate his policies," but as
mentally ill.

120
7:40
Every president at some point
or another, some bright,

121
7:43
intelligent person figures to
call him a psychopath and put

122
7:47
that in Time magazine.
Now, put aside whether--the

123
7:51
extent to which these things are
accurate, point being that we

124
7:55
often use medical labels,
particularly labels like

125
7:59
"psychopath," "schizophrenic,"
"delusional," to ostracize and

126
8:05
pick out people we disagree
with.

127
8:08
At the same time though,
this is not entirely right.

128
8:13
People go too far when they say
there's no such thing as mental

129
8:17
illness.
Some people are mentally ill in

130
8:19
a very real sense of "illness,"
in the same sense we would

131
8:23
describe somebody as physically
ill if they were to have cancer.

132
8:27
This illness damages their
functioning.

133
8:32
They cannot function well.
They do not tend to be more

134
8:35
creative or more productive or
more vivacious.

135
8:38
Rather, for – with very few
exceptions;

136
8:41
possibly some exceptions
revolving around mania as Dr.

137
8:44
Nolen-Hoeksema discussed –
with very few exceptions being

138
8:48
mentally ill is just very bad
for you in every possible way.

139
8:52
Moreover, when people are
treated, when people get better,

140
8:57
they become more competent,
happier, better able to

141
9:02
participate in the world,
and they do not choose to go

142
9:05
back to their mental illness,
suggesting that it really is

143
9:09
illness in the serious sense.
And so the modern treatment of

144
9:14
psychological disorders treats
them as disorders like medical

145
9:19
disorders.
Schizophrenia is as much a

146
9:22
disease as is cancer and should
be thought of in the same way.

147
9:27
There's a whole field of
abnormal psychology of

148
9:31
tremendous scope.
We've already discussed many

149
9:36
mental illnesses in the context
of other things.

150
9:41
So, for instance,
we talked about amnesia in the

151
9:44
context of memory and how it
works.

152
9:46
We talked about autism in the
context of social reasoning.

153
9:49
There are many more and I'm not
going to read through them.

154
9:53
These are the major categories
just for people's interest from

155
9:58
The Diagnostic and Standard
Manual. You don't have

156
10:02
to--you're not responsible for
all of these.

157
10:05
And this is an illustration,
which people might find

158
10:08
interesting, of sex differences
in these--in the major

159
10:10
disorders.
And the patterns,

160
10:12
as you could see,
are kind of neat.

161
10:15
Women are more prone to have
anxiety disorders and mood

162
10:19
disorders.
Men are much more likely to

163
10:22
suffer from substance disorders,
particularly alcoholism.

164
10:27
Schizophrenia is sort of evenly
matched but antisocial

165
10:30
personality disorders,
sometimes known as sociopathy

166
10:34
or psychopathy,
is predominantly male.

167
10:36
And we'll turn to that a bit
later.

168
10:39
Here are the major ones which I
want to review today.

169
10:43
I'm not going to talk about
mood disorders at all because

170
10:46
this was the topic of the superb
lecture we heard last week but I

171
10:50
want to quickly review
schizophrenia,

172
10:52
the class of disorders known as
anxiety disorders,

173
10:55
the class of disorders known as
dissociative disorders,

174
10:59
and the class of disorders
known as personality disorders.

175
11:03
And these are the main
psychological problems.

176
11:07
When a psychologist or
psychiatrist does his or her

177
11:10
work, they're predominantly
focused on somebody who has one

178
11:15
of these problems.
Some of them are rare but some

179
11:18
of them such as anxiety
disorders and the mood disorders

180
11:22
are very common.

181
11:23


182
11:30
About 1% of the world's
population suffers from

183
11:35
schizophrenia and this is the
most common reason for being in

184
11:41
a mental hospital.
And the reason for that is

185
11:45
because of its severity,
because of how terrible an

186
11:49
illness it is.
Schizophrenics have been

187
11:52
described as the lepers of the
twentieth century by people who

188
11:55
pointed out that in the last
hundred years people who are

189
11:58
schizophrenics are just--there's
no place for them in society.

190
12:01
They're shunned.
They're rejected.

191
12:03
We have no idea how to treat
them or how to help them.

192
12:07
The roots of schizophrenia come
from the terms "split" and

193
12:12
"mind" but the idea is there is
a split from reality.

194
12:17
It's important to stress the
sort of etymological point

195
12:21
because sometimes people confuse
schizophrenia with

196
12:24
something--with split
personality and they somehow

197
12:27
think schizophrenia refers to
having multiple personalities.

198
12:32
This is incorrect.
A multiple personality disorder

199
12:35
is an entirely different
disorder.

200
12:37
It's a sort of dissociative
disorder.

201
12:40
Split personality--people with
schizophrenia do not have

202
12:44
multiple personalities.
What they have is a problem

203
12:48
with relating to reality.
It's roughly equally split

204
12:53
between the genders but it
strikes men earlier and it

205
12:58
happens between--around these
ages and as you could see

206
13:04
roughly--and,
as you could see,

207
13:06
it is the sort of thing that
could make its first occurrence

208
13:09
while you're in college or
university.

209
13:11


210
13:14
There are five symptoms –
main symptoms of schizophrenia.

211
13:18
Four of them are the positive
symptoms, meaning things that

212
13:21
you do, that you have that's
unusual.

213
13:24
One is a negative symptom,
something that you don't have,

214
13:27
something that a schizophrenic
lacks.

215
13:29
So, just to walk through them,
a hallucination is an

216
13:34
experience, a sensory
experience, that isn't real.

217
13:38
So, the most typical
hallucinations are auditory.

218
13:41
Schizophrenics hear voices.
They hear sounds,

219
13:45
particularly people telling
them to do things,

220
13:48
that aren't real.
Sometimes there are

221
13:51
auditory--there are visual
hallucinations or hallucinations

222
13:55
of smell and taste but a typical
hallucination is auditory.

223
13:59
Sometimes the voices are seen
from coming from oneself and so

224
14:04
you could sometimes stop the
hallucinations by doing things

225
14:09
like humming or counting or
holding your mouth open.

226
14:13
And some schizophrenics will do
this in an attempt to block

227
14:17
auditory hallucinations.
There are delusions.

228
14:21
The difference between a
hallucination and a delusion is

229
14:24
a hallucination is a sensory
experience that's wrong,

230
14:27
that just didn't really happen.
A delusion is a belief that

231
14:32
isn't right.
It's a belief that you

232
14:35
shouldn't be having.
Now, again, the question of

233
14:39
what counts as a delusion and
what counts as accuracy can be a

234
14:43
controversial one.
Richard Dawkins titled his

235
14:46
recent book The God
Delusion, describing this

236
14:48
mass delusion that many people
have that they believe there's a

237
14:52
supernatural being who created
the universe and who is watching

238
14:55
them.
Some people find that

239
14:57
offensive, to call it a delusion
and people will have different

240
15:01
views.
The delusions schizophrenics

241
15:04
have tend to be pretty clearly
weird and wrong.

242
15:09
They often tend to believe they
are famous people.

243
15:12
Many schizophrenics have a
religious bent and believe that

244
15:16
they are Jesus Christ.
In 1959, there was a Michigan

245
15:19
hospital that had three Jesus
Christs in it and they would

246
15:23
meet and talk.
One theme of delusions is

247
15:28
what's called "ideas of
reference."

248
15:32
And ideas of reference are you
think that there's all sorts of

249
15:36
things happening that revolve
around you.

250
15:39
You hear people whispering and
you think they're talking about

251
15:43
you.
You pick up the newspaper and

252
15:45
you believe that there's coded
messages in it that are directed

253
15:48
towards you.
You might believe that there is

254
15:52
some sort of omnipotent,
powerful force conspiring

255
15:56
against you or trying to
manipulate you like aliens or

256
16:00
the FBI,
the CIA, the government.

257
16:03
You might believe that they
have some sort of evil plan in

258
16:06
mind for you.
There is disorganized speech.

259
16:10
Some schizophrenics babble.
They talk and it's nonsense.

260
16:14
If you listen to a
schizophrenic on the street,

261
16:17
sometimes what they're saying
makes no sense at all,

262
16:20
not merely that they're
conveying ideas that are

263
16:22
unreasonable but it's just
garbled,

264
16:24
it's just a mess.
And sometimes there is

265
16:27
disorganized behavior too,
odd motor movements.

266
16:31
And the most extreme cases of
this are motor movements

267
16:35
described as "catatonic" where
the person doesn't move,

268
16:39
often freezes in a position.
Those are all positive symptoms.

269
16:44
A major negative symptom in
schizophrenia is absence of

270
16:48
normal thought or affect,
affect meaning emotion.

271
16:51
So some schizophrenics might
just not talk.

272
16:54
They might have very low
emotional responses.

273
16:57
They might not care about
anything.

274
17:02
The basic psychological
misfunction--oh,

275
17:05
sorry.

276
17:05


277
17:10
There are different subtypes of
schizophrenia.

278
17:14
There are five major subtypes
but I'm going to focus on the

279
17:17
three major ones,
the three most interesting

280
17:20
ones.
The first one is paranoid

281
17:22
schizophrenia.
So, paranoid schizophrenics

282
17:25
believe that others are spying
and plotting against them.

283
17:30
And they often have delusions
of grandeur.

284
17:32
They often believe that other
people are jealous of them.

285
17:36
They might believe they have
supernatural powers.

286
17:38
They might believe that they're
God or a messiah.

287
17:42
The catatonic schizophrenics
are unresponsive to their

288
17:46
surroundings and often they'll
just repeat what people say to

289
17:51
them,
they won't generate their own

290
17:53
speech.
And finally,

291
17:54
the disorganized schizophrenics
are maybe what you most think of

292
17:59
when you think of somebody who
is insane.

293
18:02
They make no sense.
They have delusions and

294
18:06
hallucinations.
They babble.

295
18:08
They--their actions--they could
be dangerous.

296
18:11
They could be perceived as
dangerous.

297
18:13
They're unable to help
themselves.

298
18:15
They're unable to do anything
in their lives.

299
18:18


300
18:21
It's hard to pin down exactly
what's at root of all of these

301
18:25
problems but a very general
summary is that there is a

302
18:29
problem – an inability to put
together your thoughts and

303
18:32
perceptions,
to sequence them and coordinate

304
18:36
them, to impose a logical
structure and a reasonable,

305
18:41
realistic temporal sequence on
your experience.

306
18:47
This is the core thing going
wrong but what happens as a

307
18:51
result of this is you lose
contact with others,

308
18:54
you lose social contact.
Losing social contact means you

309
18:58
don't get much reality checking.
If I start acting weird and

310
19:02
nobody cares,
I could just get weirder and

311
19:06
weirder,
while if I'm in a good social

312
19:08
group of people who care about
me often the situation could be

313
19:11
brought under control.
So, schizophrenia is sort of a

314
19:13
vicious circle where you have
this cognitive problem.

315
19:16
Then you have problems losing
contact with others,

316
19:19
exaggerating the cognitive
problem, and so on.

317
19:22
A lot of people have studied
the genetics of schizophrenia.

318
19:27
It's clear enough that there is
a powerful genetic component.

319
19:30
I could--you can tell how much
at risk somebody is for becoming

320
19:35
schizophrenic based on the
schizophrenia and illness of

321
19:40
their family members.
In particular,

322
19:43
if you have an identical twin
who's schizophrenic,

323
19:46
your odds are about a half of
becoming schizophrenic yourself.

324
19:50
At the same time,
and we dealt with this as well

325
19:53
when we talked about issues of
sexual orientation,

326
19:56
the fact that identical twins
the odds are only 50% means

327
20:01
there has to be an environmental
component to it.

328
20:05
If it was entirely genetic,
it would be 100%.

329
20:08
And so one claim--one way of
looking at it is your genes make

330
20:12
you vulnerable to schizophrenia
but whether or not you become

331
20:16
schizophrenic depends on what
happens in your environment.

332
20:20
You're sensitive to certain
triggers.

333
20:23
Some triggers might happen
early.

334
20:26
There is some evidence that
schizophrenia is associated with

335
20:30
trauma even at the point of
birth.

336
20:32
And there's some other evidence
that schizophrenia is linked to

337
20:37
viral infections.
As an example,

338
20:39
there are more schizophrenics
born in the winter,

339
20:43
subtle--a subtle difference but
there seems to be a reliable

340
20:47
effect of more schizophrenics
born in the winter.

341
20:51
More people get sick in the
winter.

342
20:53
At times when there's been some
sort of epidemic or some sort of

343
20:57
plague, this seems to cause a
jump in the frequency of

344
21:00
schizophrenics born at that
time.

345
21:03
There's some recent research
that ties schizophrenia to the

346
21:07
possibility of toxoplasmosis,
which is a disorder carried by

347
21:12
cat feces.
The experiment basically

348
21:14
involved asking the parents of
schizophrenics one question:

349
21:18
"Did you own a cat when your
child was born?"

350
21:21
And if the answer was "yes," it
seemed to correspond to a bit

351
21:25
higher odds for schizophrenic
families than for

352
21:28
non-schizophrenic families.
A different sort of trigger is

353
21:33
stressful family environments.
Schizophrenics seem to really

354
21:39
have more stressful family
environments than

355
21:41
non-schizophrenics.
Now, we have to be careful

356
21:46
about this.
We have to bring--we have to

357
21:49
return to the sort of
methodological cautions we had

358
21:52
in mind when we talked about
individual difference research

359
21:55
in general.
Remember we talked about the

360
21:58
worst study in the world and one
of the features of this was it

361
22:02
was failing to pull apart cause
and effect.

362
22:05
It might be that having a
difficult family environment ups

363
22:09
your odds of becoming
schizophrenic.

364
22:11
On the other hand,
it might also be that

365
22:13
schizophrenic children or
children who will become

366
22:16
schizophrenic are difficult to
deal with in certain ways

367
22:19
causing a family environment.
So, it's not clear whether the

368
22:23
effect is from difficult family
environment to later

369
22:26
schizophrenia or from
schizophrenia to difficult

370
22:29
family environment.
There used to be a very popular

371
22:32
theory of schizophrenia,
which is that it was caused by

372
22:36
excess dopamine.
Dopamine, you'll remember,

373
22:39
is a neurotransmitter.
And there is some reason to

374
22:43
take this seriously.
Drugs that reduce dopamine

375
22:47
provide some help in reducing
symptoms.

376
22:50
And if I give you a drug that
shoots up your dopamine that

377
22:56
will turn you into a temporary
schizophrenic.

378
23:02
You get what's called
"amphetamine psychosis" and it'd

379
23:05
give you--it can give you
schizophrenic-like symptoms,

380
23:09
hallucinations,
delusions, that sort of thing.

381
23:12
This--There might be something
to this theory but we know now

382
23:15
it can't be complete for at
least two reasons.

383
23:18
First, it doesn't explain the
negative symptoms.

384
23:22
It explains hallucinations and
delusions and so on but it

385
23:27
doesn't explain the loss of
affect, the quietness,

386
23:32
the stillness.
Also, there seemed to be some

387
23:36
sort of structural brain
differences involving enlarged

388
23:40
cerebral ventricles,
involving reduced frontal lobe

389
23:44
activity, suggesting that the
problem with schizophrenia is a

390
23:48
lot more complicated than others
might have it,

391
23:51
than the dopamine theory would
have it.

392
23:53
I'll end with a mystery.
And this mystery is discussed

393
23:58
nicely in the Gray textbook.
The symptoms of schizophrenia,

394
24:03
the prevalence of
schizophrenics,

395
24:06
is similar wherever you go but
less industrialized countries

396
24:11
have a better rate of recovery
from schizophrenia than

397
24:16
industrialized countries.
And nobody really knows why.

398
24:20
I listed here three
possibilities.

399
24:22
One is that the families that
were--that--in a less

400
24:25
industrialized country there's
more latitude and so there's

401
24:29
less critical- less criticism.
There's less use of

402
24:32
antipsychotic medication.
Antipsychotic medications help

403
24:35
with the symptoms but they might
also impair recovery.

404
24:38
And finally,
if you think of schizophrenia

405
24:41
as a transient disorder,
maybe that will in some sense,

406
24:44
in some way,
make that more likely to

407
24:46
actually happen.

408
24:47


409
24:52
The second sort of disorder I
want to talk about,

410
24:55
much more common than the 1%
that's schizophrenia,

411
24:58
is the classic disorders known
as "anxiety disorders."

412
25:02


413
25:09
The primary disturbance in
anxiety disorders is anxiety;

414
25:13
you have a lot of anxiety.
It's persistent,

415
25:16
either anxiety or maladaptive
behaviors to reduce anxiety.

416
25:25
Now, everybody experiences
anxiety.

417
25:28
If you didn't experience
anxiety, you'd be a very strange

418
25:30
person and you probably wouldn't
function very well in the world,

419
25:33
but you have an anxiety
disorder when you experience too

420
25:37
much of it, it's uncontrollable,
it's unreasonable and it messes

421
25:41
up your life.
And there's quite a few anxiety

422
25:43
disorders.
The simplest one is this

423
25:46
generalized anxiety disorders
where--and this is about one in

424
25:50
twenty people will get it at
some point in their lives and

425
25:53
you worry all the time.
You're just very anxious.

426
25:56
You're just worried all the
time and it could be paralyzing.

427
26:00
It could give you physical
symptoms like headaches,

428
26:03
stomachaches,
muscle tension and

429
26:05
irritability.
There is some evidence that

430
26:08
generalized anxiety disorder has
a genetic component,

431
26:12
that it's somehow related to
major depression.

432
26:16
And it does seem to have its
possible roots in some sort of

433
26:21
childhood trauma.
And so the model some people

434
26:25
give for this is when you are
young something really bad

435
26:30
happens to you.
This makes you hyper-vigilant.

436
26:34
You don't trust the world,
bad things could always happen

437
26:37
around the corner.
And because you're

438
26:40
hyper-vigilant you are more
prone to develop generalized

439
26:45
anxiety disorder after a
difficult life event.

440
26:49
A second sort of anxiety
disorder, which we already

441
26:52
discussed in class are phobias
and phobias are intense,

442
26:56
irrational fears.
They could focus on objects,

443
26:59
events, and social settings.
Here's a nice diagram of

444
27:02
different phobia,
different things,

445
27:04
and their proportion of people
who are afraid of it.

446
27:07
And the point of this diagram
isn't with the details.

447
27:11
It's really--It's rather to
give you a feeling for the fact

448
27:14
that some things most everybody
is afraid of or a lot of people

449
27:17
are afraid of and some things
not many at all.

450
27:20
The big phobic object we know
from previous lectures is

451
27:23
snakes.
About 40% of the population say

452
27:26
they're afraid of snakes.
How many people here are afraid

453
27:29
of snakes?
Okay.

454
27:33
And then there's a really
terrifying thing,

455
27:36
mice.
How many people are afraid of

456
27:39
mice?
Mice are the worst things in

457
27:41
the world.
[laughter]

458
27:43
And then cats and if you're
afraid of cats that's really

459
27:47
unusual.
Not many people are afraid of

460
27:50
cats.
There is a classical

461
27:52
conditioning model of phobias,
which we are all familiar with,

462
27:56
but we are all familiar with
why it is not a very good

463
28:00
theory.
A lot of people who are afraid

464
28:02
of snakes have never had a bad
experience with snakes.

465
28:06
Moreover, a lot of people who
have had bad experiences with

466
28:09
things like car crashes and
being electrocuted on a socket

467
28:13
or a shooting,
seeing a gun during a shooting,

468
28:16
do not develop phobias.
This lead--gives rise to a much

469
28:20
more plausible theory known as
the "preparedness theory,"

470
28:23
which says that we have evolved
to be sensitive to certain

471
28:26
phobic objects,
objects that were dangerous to

472
28:29
us in our evolutionary history.
And we're prone to develop

473
28:33
phobic responses to this.
The final anxiety disorder is

474
28:38
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Obsessions are irrational

475
28:42
disturbing thoughts that intrude
into your consciousness.

476
28:48
This is--hits about two to
three percent of the population

477
28:53
and it leads to compulsions,
repetitive actions performed to

478
28:58
alleviate the obsessions.
For instance,

479
29:02
you might be obsessed with the
idea of being dirty,

480
29:04
your hands are dirty,
you're filthy.

481
29:06
That might lead to compulsive
washing.

482
29:09
You might believe that God is
angry at you and that might lead

483
29:15
to compulsive prayer.
Cleanliness and religion are

484
29:19
common themes of
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

485
29:24
You often know,
rationally, that these are

486
29:27
unreasonable behaviors but you
can't help yourself from doing

487
29:32
them.
Sometimes I get the worry that

488
29:34
I left my door unlocked and I
run back and checked it--check

489
29:38
it.
But I feel it's a little bit of

490
29:40
OCD coming on because I know I
locked it, but did I really lock

491
29:44
it?
And then you get--now I'm

492
29:46
worried if I locked my door.
Checking and washing.

493
29:51
Checking is what I'm talking
about here- most common

494
29:54
compulsions, and it seems to
have a neuropsychological

495
29:58
phenomena.
At least it's related to

496
30:00
heightened neural activity in
the caudate nucleus.

497
30:03
What's interesting is you might
think obsessive-compulsive

498
30:07
disorder is a very sort of
Freudian,

499
30:10
psychoanalytic sort of disorder
but actually it's treated quite

500
30:14
well with drugs,
drugs that affect the serotonin

501
30:18
level.
Serotonin, being a

502
30:19
neurotransmitter,
can often do good work for

503
30:21
obsessive-compulsive disorders.
So, if you develop a disorder,

504
30:24
an OCD problem,
you might find yourself being

505
30:27
cured simply with medications.

506
30:29


507
30:36
We've talked about
schizophrenia and anxiety

508
30:39
disorders.
Any questions or thoughts so

509
30:43
far?
Yes.

510
30:44
Student: What's the
difference between OCD and

511
30:46
Tourette's or are they
[inaudible]

512
30:47
Professor Paul Bloom:
It's a good question.

513
30:49
The question was the
relationship between OCD and

514
30:52
Tourette's.
Tourette's is--I don't know

515
30:54
much about it but it's a very
specific neurophysiological

516
30:59
syndrome that doesn't have--you
don't have obsessive thoughts.

517
31:04
What it leads to is involuntary
tics and tremors and sometimes

518
31:08
sort of shouted obscenities or
taboo words.

519
31:12
And it seems to be very
specific to that while OCD is

520
31:15
much broader and involves both
behaviors but also the behaviors

521
31:19
are in the service of thoughts.
That's one way of thinking

522
31:23
about the difference.
Yes.

523
31:25
Student: Can individuals
have multiple disorders like be

524
31:28
bipolar and schizophrenic?
Professor Paul Bloom:

525
31:32
Yes.
The question is can individuals

526
31:33
have multiple disorders?
Absolutely, and in fact some

527
31:37
disorders are "comorbid."
And that's just a fancy way of

528
31:40
saying they often go together.
So, if you have a severe

529
31:43
depression for instance,
which is a mood disorder,

530
31:46
you may also have an anxiety
disorder.

531
31:48
So yes, having one
unfortunately doesn't immunize

532
31:51
you against having another.
Yes.

533
31:54
Student: Where does
superstition [inaudible]

534
31:57
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question was about

535
32:01
superstitions.
I think--it's an interesting

536
32:04
question which I have never
thought of before.

537
32:08
I think it depends on the
severity of superstitions.

538
32:11
So, if you just have a
superstition saying "Step on a

539
32:15
crack, break your mother's
back,"

540
32:17
which has never been
scientifically proven,

541
32:19
[laughter]
but suppose you--and then so

542
32:21
you're just kind of "Oh,
I kind of--I just kind of--" or

543
32:24
it's bad luck to break a mirror
and that's it,

544
32:26
you just have it and it doesn't
make a big deal to you,

545
32:29
that's harmless.
On the other hand,

546
32:31
if your superstition is such
that you develop weird rituals;

547
32:37
you might have to carefully
walk so you don't step on any

548
32:40
other--on any cracks or you
might have to do--or if you do

549
32:43
you might have to go back and
start your whole walk to work

550
32:46
over again.
When it gets to that level it

551
32:49
could creep into OCD.
And often obsessive-compulsive

552
32:53
disorders have a religious or a
magical manifestation where you

553
32:57
believe there are certain things
you must do or terrible things

554
33:01
will happen and in that way you
could view them as extreme and

555
33:06
build from superstitions,
but simple superstitions don't

556
33:11
tend to be of that type.
Yes, in back.

557
33:14
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

558
33:18
The question is "are people with
schizophrenia dangerous?"

559
33:22
As a rule statistically,
it tends not to be the case.

560
33:27
They tend to be more likely
victims than harmful.

561
33:30
They tend to be fairly helpless.
You can have a case where a

562
33:34
schizophrenic might harm
somebody.

563
33:36
A paranoid schizophrenic,
for instance,

564
33:39
might develop a delusion to
harm somebody and so there are

565
33:43
definitely such cases but for
the most part,

566
33:46
again, they are more victims
than oppressors.

567
33:51
They're more--they're very
vulnerable because they aren't

568
33:53
capable of dealing with other
people.

569
33:55
They often aren't capable of
defending themselves.

570
33:59
One more.
Yes.

571
34:01
Student: How permanent
are the effects of the

572
34:05
medications?
Professor Paul Bloom:

573
34:06
The question is,
"How permanent is the effect of

574
34:08
the medication?"
Do you mean for schizophrenia?

575
34:10
Student: Do they have to
stay on the medication for

576
34:13
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

577
34:14
Yes.
In general, I think.

578
34:16
I can't think of any exceptions.
The effects of medication are

579
34:21
temporary.
Now, that doesn't mean if you

580
34:23
have a bout of OCD or depression
you have to be on medication the

581
34:26
rest of your life.
What could happen is,

582
34:29
for instance,
somebody--if you had a mild

583
34:31
depression, go on something like
Prozac or Wellbutrin,

584
34:35
use that time to kind of get
your life back together,

585
34:38
cheer up a bit,
and then when they go off the

586
34:41
medication they are fine.
But as Professor Nolen-Hoeksema

587
34:45
pointed out, unless they've
developed coping skills they're

588
34:48
likely to relapse and get the
problem again.

589
34:51
So, the physical effects of
medication are always temporary,

590
34:54
particularly with anybody with
schizophrenia,

591
34:57
but they can often help people
get out of a problem,

592
35:00
anxiety or depression.
Okay.

593
35:03
Dissociative disorders.
I'll show you a movie clip and

594
35:08
then we'll go back and talk a
little bit about it.

595
35:13
Let me ask you a question that
might seem somewhat uncaring.

596
35:20
How many of you think he's
faking?

597
35:22


598
35:25
How many of you [laughter]
are confident there are many

599
35:30
people living inside his head
as--in the way it's depicted?

600
35:35
Okay.
How many of you are unsure?

601
35:39
How many of you have two minds?
There is one part of you

602
35:43
struggling-- [laughter]
It's--let's go--we'll go back

603
35:47
to him.
Dissociative disorder are

604
35:51
disorders involving
dissociation.

605
35:54
And what people mean by that is
literally a dissociation of

606
35:58
memory;
that is, you become somehow

607
36:02
unaware, separated from some
part of your identity or history

608
36:08
and you're unable to recall
those parts of your identity and

609
36:14
history except sometimes under
special circumstances.

610
36:20
Now, some degree of
dissociation is normal.

611
36:25
There is--I will--I have here
in, actually,

612
36:28
Dr.
Nolen-Hoeksema's excellent

613
36:31
abnormal psychology textbook a
checklist of dissociative

614
36:36
experiences many of which normal
people have: "Not sure whether

615
36:42
one has done something or only
thought about it."

616
36:47
Anybody ever have that?
Common.

617
36:50
"So involved in the fantasy
that it seems real."

618
36:57
[laughter]
"Feeling as though one's body

619
37:02
is not one's own."
I will also add that

620
37:07
experiments with pharmaceuticals
can often lead to dissociative

621
37:13
experiences.
[laughter]

622
37:15
"Driving a car and realizing
that one doesn't remember part

623
37:20
of the trip.
Talking out loud to oneself

624
37:24
when alone."
Okay.

625
37:27
"Not recognizing one's
reflection in a mirror."

626
37:31
Okay.
That's not very common

627
37:36
[laughter]
but it is--it's within the

628
37:39
normal range but then you get
more severe cases and there is

629
37:45
three different types:
dissociative amnesia,

630
37:50
dissociative fugue,
and dissociative identity

631
37:54
disorder.
Dissociative amnesia is

632
37:57
illustrated in a story of a
woman who sees something

633
38:02
terrible and as a result her
memory of that experience was no

634
38:08
longer accessible.
It's often known as

635
38:12
"psychogenic amnesia."
The only thing wrong in here is

636
38:17
you have memory loss.
And sometimes it's a selective

637
38:22
memory loss but sometimes it
could be global.

638
38:26
It's as in these movies cases
where you lose your memory

639
38:29
because something terrible has
happened and you would get it

640
38:32
back later but you have a
temporary loss of identity.

641
38:36
The idea is that something so
terrible has happened you

642
38:39
separate yourself from your
previous identity and your

643
38:42
memory.
Over half of people charged

644
38:45
with homicide claim to have some
degree of dissociative amnesia.

645
38:52
The problem here is that many,
many, many of those cases

646
38:56
involve alcohol and drugs,
which can lead to some sort of

647
39:00
alcoholic blackout.
Also, people could be lying.

648
39:04
If you're charged with murder,
it's often a reasonable thing

649
39:08
to say, "I don't remember any of
this,"

650
39:10
to just kind of--and--as a way
to distance yourself from it.

651
39:14
Dissociative fugue is kind of
weird and interesting.

652
39:19
The guy's wife leaves him for
another man.

653
39:22
Six months later he was
discovered tending bar in Miami

654
39:26
Beach and calling himself
Martin.

655
39:28
And he totally wiped out his
past memory and developed a new

656
39:33
identity.
This is also known as

657
39:36
"psychogenic fugue."
So, it's global amnesia but

658
39:40
there's also identity
replacement.

659
39:43
You leave home,
you develop a new identity,

660
39:47
and it's called a fugue state.
This is my favorite mental

661
39:52
disorder.
If I had to get a serious

662
39:54
mental disorder,
I would get this because I'd

663
39:57
get to travel.
When it wears off your old

664
40:00
identity comes back and your new
identity is forgotten.

665
40:03
Then there's dissociative
identity disorder and this is a

666
40:08
story of this woman who goes
back and forth from her regular

667
40:14
personality to a personality of
Donna who is only six years old.

668
40:20


669
40:25
This was originally known as
""multiple personality disorder"

670
40:29
and the idea is you have two or
more distinct people in one

671
40:32
head.
It is--there are--It is a rare

672
40:35
and controversial disorder but
it includes some very famous

673
40:40
cases and has been illustrated
in many movies and books

674
40:44
including the wonderful movie
Primal Fear where--Ed

675
40:48
Norton's first big movie,
highly recommend it.

676
40:52
And it's been tried as a
criminal defense.

677
40:55
The Hillside Strangler claimed
to be two people but he was

678
40:59
still convicted,
both of them.

679
41:02
It typically starts early,
the pattern of dissociation.

680
41:08
Mostly it's women.
And mostly, it involves some

681
41:11
sort of recollection of torture
or sexual abuse.

682
41:15
Also, and to get back to your
question, can you have more than

683
41:19
one mental disorder at the same
time,

684
41:21
people with dissociative
disorder often show symptoms of

685
41:24
posttraumatic stress disorder or
PTSD.

686
41:27
What causes it?
Well, it is often argued to be

687
41:33
the cause--caused by severe
abuse, often sexual or physical

688
41:38
abuse.
The problem is most people who

689
41:41
get abused don't develop
dissociative identity disorder.

690
41:45
And one idea is that it's abuse
plus some sort of genetic or

691
41:50
biological predisposition to
dissociate and in fact,

692
41:54
people with dissociative
identity disorder seem to be

693
41:57
very susceptible.
They're easier to hypnotize

694
42:00
than other people.
And so it might begin as sort

695
42:03
of a self--an act of
self-hypnosis.

696
42:06
You put yourself in a hypnotic
trance to cope with some

697
42:10
terrible situation and you begin
to develop new and separate and

698
42:14
distinct personalities.
Now, of the many things I'm

699
42:18
going to talk to you,
I've talked--spoken about,

700
42:21
some have been very
controversial.

701
42:24
One issue of controversy which
we talked about was the

702
42:27
existence in nature of so-called
"repressed memories."

703
42:31
This is another very
controversial case related to

704
42:34
the repressed memory case.
In a recent poll,

705
42:37
less than one quarter of
psychiatrists believe there is

706
42:42
such a thing as dissociative
identity disorder.

707
42:47
Why would you doubt that?
Well, there are some curious

708
42:50
statistics.
Between 1930 and 1960,

709
42:52
there were two cases in the
United States.

710
42:56
In the 1980s,
there were 20,000 cases.

711
42:59
You cannot go elsewhere from
the United States and find

712
43:02
people with dissociative
identity disorder.

713
43:05
It seems to be an American
phenomena.

714
43:07
And it varies by therapists.
Some therapists,

715
43:11
indeed some hospitals,
some medical units go decades

716
43:15
without ever seeing anybody that
approaches dissociative identity

717
43:20
disorder.
Other therapists,

718
43:22
virtually every patient they
have has multiple personalities.

719
43:26
One worry based on these facts
is dissociative identity

720
43:31
disorder is in a sense real,
that Richard really does

721
43:36
believe he's moving from
personality to personality but

722
43:39
he didn't come in to therapy
with that problem.

723
43:43
Rather, his therapist gave it
to him.

724
43:45
The claim is that it's the
result of suggestion by the

725
43:49
therapist.
The therapists,

726
43:51
and they're typically good
people who wish to help,

727
43:54
but the therapists might be in
the grips of a theory involving

728
43:57
repression and multiple
personalities and different

729
44:01
selves and encourage,
either tacitly or overtly,

730
44:05
their patients to develop these
separate personalities.

731
44:10
Related to this,
it's not clear to what extent

732
44:13
dissociative identity disorder
is an extreme version of normal

733
44:17
psychopathology--sorry,
of normal psychology.

734
44:21
So people, from the philosopher
Dan Dennett to the psychologist

735
44:26
Judith Harris,
have pointed out that we're

736
44:29
different selves in different
situations.

737
44:32
We can consciously play act the
different selves but we could

738
44:35
also just shift personalities
depending on whether we're with

739
44:39
our friends or our family or
with strangers.

740
44:42
The claim is that dissociative
identity disorder,

741
44:45
however dramatic it looks,
might merely be an extended

742
44:49
version of this where people as
well are to some extent play

743
44:53
acting to make their therapists
and doctors happy.

744
44:56


745
45:00
Any questions about
dissociative identity disorder?

746
45:06
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

747
45:09
Professor Paul Bloom:
Yes.

748
45:13
Dissociative amnesia--the
question involves the

749
45:15
relationship between
dissociative amnesia and the

750
45:18
retrograde and anterograde
amnesia discussed before.

751
45:21
Those other amnesias are the
result of brain damage.

752
45:23
They tend to be if not
permanent long lasting and

753
45:28
severe.
Dissociative amnesia is

754
45:30
apparently caused by specific
life events and can often be

755
45:34
very short-lived.
They're, of course,

756
45:37
all brain events but in the
crude sense the dissociative

757
45:40
amnesia is more of a
psychological happening than the

758
45:44
other sorts of amnesias that we
talked about involving Korsakoff

759
45:48
syndrome and the patient "HM"
and so on.

760
45:50


761
45:56
Other questions.
Yes, in back.

762
45:59
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

763
46:08
Yes.
What happened in 1960--There

764
46:11
was a very famous case.
I think the case was the case

765
46:14
of Sybil.
Does anybody know?

766
46:17
The teaching fellows are
nodding but there was a very

767
46:19
famous case which I think was of
Sybil which was made into a

768
46:23
movie and discussed and had a
huge influence on people and

769
46:26
then they started to believe
that it was real.

770
46:28


771
46:32
There is a type--The fourth and
final type of disorder is

772
46:36
something which is not actually
discussed in the Gray textbook

773
46:41
but it has to do with
personality and this is

774
46:45
interesting because it probably
extends to some extent to many

775
46:49
of these people--the people in
this room.

776
46:53
Personality,
as you remember,

777
46:55
is your way of dealing with the
world, in particular the way you

778
47:00
have of dealing with other
people.

779
47:03
The notion of personality
disorders is that some

780
47:07
personalities are so bad that
they veer off into mental

781
47:12
illness so one personality
disorder is a narcissistic

782
47:16
personality disorder.
Everyone likes to talk about

783
47:20
themselves and thinks they're
terrific to some extent,

784
47:24
some people to a little bit too
much, but if it's really extreme

785
47:28
they could talk--they--you could
get labeled with a narcissistic

786
47:32
personality disorder.
You might have an avoidant

787
47:36
personality disorder,
dependent, histrionic,

788
47:41
borderline.
Borderline is really bad.

789
47:44
When people describe you as a
borderline personality disorder,

790
47:48
that just means you're just
awful to be with,

791
47:50
you're kind of awful.
[laughter]

792
47:52
There is the paranoid
personality disorder which is

793
47:56
not that you're paranoid
schizophrenic,

794
47:59
very clearly no signs of
schizophrenia,

795
48:02
no hallucinations,
nothing like that.

796
48:04
You are just paranoid.
You're just--to a greater

797
48:07
extent than normal,
you think other people are

798
48:10
against you and plotting against
you.

799
48:13
The most interesting
personality disorders in my mind

800
48:17
have to do with violence and
crime and they have to do in

801
48:21
particular with something called
"antisocial personality

802
48:25
disorder."
Now, most murderers are not

803
48:29
mentally ill in a medical sense.
They're not mentally ill

804
48:34
according to how clinicians
categorize things.

805
48:37
To some extent,
most people who kill are just

806
48:41
normal people being driven by
normal desires,

807
48:45
rage, jealousy,
hate, just taken to an extreme.

808
48:50
Even mass murderers do not as a
rule appear to be substantively

809
48:55
different from a psychological
point of view.

810
48:58
In every society--and honestly,
I wrote the lecture on this

811
49:03
quite a while ago but,
given the recent events,

812
49:07
they stand as a perfectly good
example of what I'm going to

813
49:11
say.
In every society there is a

814
49:14
notion of somebody who has been
deeply humiliated,

815
49:17
usually male,
and he's been humiliated over

816
49:21
and over again.
He sees himself as losing

817
49:24
status and losing status and
losing status and he tries to

818
49:27
get it all back,
to gain face with one act of

819
49:31
terrible violence where he takes
his revenge over everybody and

820
49:36
then is known as--and as a
result,

821
49:39
even though he might die,
he probably will die,

822
49:43
makes his way to a level of
social status he would have

823
49:46
never gotten before.
The American term for this used

824
49:51
to be "going postal" and--but
this is an old idea.

825
49:56
Stone Age tribes in Papua,
New Guinea, had a term for

826
50:00
this.
They call it "running amok" and

827
50:03
this is--and every society has
this.

828
50:06
So, there's normal murderers,
there's mass murderers,

829
50:09
and then there's the
interesting cases like serial

830
50:13
killers like Dahmer or Son of
Sam,

831
50:16
Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy,
even the imaginary Hannibal

832
50:20
Lecter.
Many of these sort of serial

833
50:22
killers do have some sort of
mental illness but the mental

834
50:26
illnesses are all over the
place.

835
50:28
There was a guy,
Jerome Brudos,

836
50:30
who had such a severe fetish
for women's feet that he killed

837
50:34
young women and severed their
feet and then kept their feet

838
50:38
around his house.
Son of Sam was pretty clearly a

839
50:43
paranoid schizophrenic.
He did his murders because a

840
50:47
barking dog told him to.
Jeffrey Dahmer is a cannibal

841
50:51
killer and he killed people so
he could eat them and then--and

842
50:55
I asked one of my colleagues in
clinical--colleagues what

843
50:59
exactly was wrong with him and
the person immediately

844
51:02
responded,
"He has a severe eating

845
51:05
disorder."
[laughter]

846
51:07
So, it's--it was a joke.
It was in very, very bad taste.

847
51:11
[laughter]
A lot of [laughter]

848
51:14
murderers claim to have
dissociative disorders,

849
51:17
"it wasn't me who killed the
guy, it was my alter ego,

850
51:22
Fred."
It's not clear how often

851
51:24
they're telling the truth,
if ever or whether this is a

852
51:28
way of escaping responsibility.
There is a mental

853
51:32
illness--There's an extreme,
specific version of a

854
51:36
personality disorder that
revolves around violence,

855
51:40
and this is known as
"antisocial personality

856
51:43
disorder."

857
51:43


858
51:47
It is--it used to be called
moral insanity.

859
51:50
Now it's often called
psychopathy.

860
51:54
Some people make a distinction
between psychopath and

861
51:58
sociopath.
For the purposes here others

862
52:01
don't, and for the purposes here
I'm going to blend them into one

863
52:04
category.
Then I'll use the term

864
52:07
"psychopath."
They're typically male.

865
52:11
They are defined as selfish,
callous, impulsive,

866
52:15
they're sexually promiscuous.
They seem to lack love,

867
52:20
loyalty, normal feelings of
affiliation and compassion,

868
52:25
and they get into all sorts of
trouble because they're easily

869
52:30
bored and they seek out
stimulation.

870
52:33
Now, when you hear this,
you've got to realize that this

871
52:37
sort of person is not
necessarily an unattractive

872
52:41
person to imagine or think about
or even under some circumstances

873
52:46
to encounter.
You have to avoid the

874
52:48
temptation when you think about
psychopath to think about a guy

875
52:51
like this, to think about
Hannibal Lecter.

876
52:53
The most famous psychopath,
of course, is James Bond who is

877
52:59
a perfect psychopath in every
regard as played by him also by

878
53:04
Sean Connery.
The Roger Moore and Timothy

879
53:07
Dalton characters were not
psychopaths.

880
53:10
I could give a whole course on
that.

881
53:12
Is this an illness?
Well, again,

882
53:16
this is one of the hard cases.
Psychopaths don't come in for

883
53:21
treatment.
James Bond would never go to a

884
53:24
therapist and say,
"I have a problem with

885
53:26
promiscuity and my life of
adventure.

886
53:28
[laughter]
Why is it that I don't have

887
53:30
this need to settle down and
have kids and be a one-woman

888
53:34
man?"
They don't have a problem with

889
53:37
it.
Other people often have a

890
53:38
problem with it but it's not
clear that's enough to make it a

891
53:42
mental disorder.
Also, a lot of psychopaths are

892
53:46
reasonably successful.
Now, this gets complicated

893
53:49
because psychologists study
psychopaths but the psychopaths

894
53:54
that they study are by
definition unsuccessful

895
53:57
psychopaths.
And what some people have

896
54:00
argued is the real psychopaths,
the successful ones,

897
54:04
are the ones that run the
world, that excel in every field

898
54:08
because they are successful
enough that they don't look like

899
54:11
psychopaths.
They have no conscience,

900
54:13
no compassion,
love, loyalty.

901
54:15
They are cold-blooded and
ambitious but they don't go

902
54:19
around making this so obvious
that we throw them in prison.

903
54:23
And so, it's an interesting and
subtle and complicated case.

904
54:28


905
54:33
The final section – and I'll
start this and we'll go five

906
54:37
minutes into this and then
move--continue it next week with

907
54:40
the final class – concerns
therapy.

908
54:43


909
54:48
Now, the most interesting thing
for us to deal with is the

910
54:52
question of, "Does therapy
work?"

911
54:54
And there's a lot to be said
about this.

912
54:57
The history of therapy has been
gruesome and unsuccessful.

913
55:00
Again, to be mad was to be
viewed as to be in league with

914
55:04
the devil and so people with
mental illnesses were tortured

915
55:07
to death,
burnt, sent out to sea and so

916
55:11
on.
In the eighteenth century they

917
55:12
were thought of as degenerates
and sent away from society.

918
55:15
In the nineteenth century there
was a brief blast of compassion

919
55:21
where Pinel tried to have mental
hospitals and then there were

920
55:27
all sorts of--since then all
sorts of medical treatments that

921
55:33
were considerably less
successful and this brief video

922
55:38
will summarize some of the
previous medical treatments.

923
55:44
I often wonder a hundred years
from now how they're going to

924
55:48
look at our current therapies
and then whether they'll see

925
55:51
them as equally barbaric and
stupid as we look at the

926
55:55
therapies in the past.
What I'll begin next lecture

927
55:59
with is a very quick discussion
of what therapies work of the

928
56:03
ones currently available and
then I'll end the class.

929
56:08
And this will be a somewhat
short class.

930
56:09
I'll end the class with a
discussion of happiness.

931
56:13
There is an optional thing I'll
add, which is your reading

932
56:17
responses are done and you'll
have the opportunity to make

933
56:20
comments on the class in
anonymous evaluations but what

934
56:24
I'm kind of interested in is if
people could send me an e-mail,

935
56:29
and this is entirely optional,
about the most interesting

936
56:32
thing that we've covered in this
class.

937
56:34
I'm curious what people think
it is and it's something which I

938
56:37
could try to build up on for
future classes.

939
56:39
So, again, this is optional.
Just give it a subject heading

940
56:43
"Intro Psych" and send it to me
if you choose to do it and I'll

941
56:45
see you on Wednesday.
