Professor Paul Bloom:
Sex is really strange.

2
0:17


3
0:21
You ask people,
"What's your favorite

4
0:25
activity?"
and if you ask people,

5
0:28
particularly college students,
particularly just fresh from

6
0:33
spring break – I've seen teen
movies – they'll often answer,

7
0:40
"Sex."
or some word that is synonymous

8
0:44
with sex.
But there's a kind of a puzzle

9
0:48
about how much time we spend on
sex.

10
0:53
And it turns out there is data
on this.

11
0:56
So, people say sex is their
favorite activity,

12
0:59
but it turns out we actually
know how much time the average

13
1:03
American spends on sex.
And the data I'm going to

14
1:07
follow from was summarized in
this wonderful book by James

15
1:12
Gleick:
Americans tell pollsters

16
1:15
their single favorite activity
is sex.

17
1:17
In terms of enjoyability,
they rank sex ahead of sports,

18
1:21
fishing, bar-hopping,
hugging and kissing,

19
1:24
talking with the family,
eating, watching television,

20
1:28
going on trips,
planning trips,

21
1:30
gardening, bathing,
shopping, dressing,

22
1:32
housework, dishwashing,
laundry, visiting the dentist,

23
1:36
and getting the car repaired.
On the other hand,

24
1:39
these same studies suggested
the average time per day devoted

25
1:45
to sex is four minutes and three
seconds.

26
1:49
[As Gleick says,]
This is not much,

27
1:52
even if the four minutes
excludes time spent flirting,

28
1:58
dancing, ogling,
cruising the boulevard,

29
2:01
toning up in gyms,
toning up in beauty parlors,

30
2:04
rehearsing pick up lines,
showering, thinking about sex,

31
2:07
reading about sex,
doodling pornographically,

32
2:11
looking at erotic magazines,
renting videos,

33
2:16
dreaming of sex,
looking at fashion magazines,

34
2:19
cleaning up after sex,
coping with the consequences of

35
2:22
sex,
building towers or otherwise

36
2:24
repressing, transferring,
and sublimating .

37
2:28


38
2:31
And I like this passage because
it illustrates two points,

39
2:35
two important points.
One is we don't actually spend

40
2:38
that much time on sex.
In fact, the four minutes and

41
2:41
three seconds is an interesting
number because when you do times

42
2:46
studies on how much Americans
spend filling out tax-related

43
2:50
forms for the IRS,
it's four minutes and a few

44
2:54
seconds.
But the passage also points out

45
2:57
that regardless of the brute
time we spend on it,

46
3:00
it is extraordinarily
important.

47
3:03
Everything in life follows from
it – marriage,

48
3:06
family, children,
much of aggression,

49
3:09
much of competition,
much of art and music and

50
3:13
creative pursuits.
Much of everything follows from

51
3:17
it.
If we were a creature without

52
3:19
sex, everything would be
different.

53
3:21
And what's interesting is,
there are creatures without

54
3:24
sex.
There are creatures that

55
3:27
reproduce by cloning.
And in fact,

56
3:29
this basic fact about people
– that we fall,

57
3:32
roughly, into males and females
– is an evolutionary mystery.

58
3:37
It's not clear why animals that
are somewhat large have two

59
3:42
sexes.
From a biological Darwinian

60
3:45
perspective, having two sexes is
bizarre because each time you

61
3:48
have an offspring you toss away
half your genes.

62
3:51
My children only have--each of
them have half my DNA.

63
3:55
If I were to clone,
they would have all of it.

64
3:58
And so, it's a puzzle how sex
ever evolved.

65
4:02
This is not a course in
evolutionary biology,

66
4:04
and that's not the puzzle we're
going to be looking at today.

67
4:07
We're going to look at a few
questions.

68
4:10
First, we're going to talk from
first a theoretical point of

69
4:13
view and then an empirical point
of view about how males and

70
4:17
females are different.
Then we're going to talk about

71
4:20
sexual attractiveness,
some research about what people

72
4:23
find to be sexually attractive,
and then we'll talk a very

73
4:26
little bit at the end about the
origins of sexual preference:

74
4:29
why some people are straight,
others gay, others bisexual,

75
4:33
and others harder to classify.
Now, of all the topics I'm

76
4:38
presenting, sex is one of the
sort of dicey ones from an

77
4:42
emotional point of view.
These are difficult issues

78
4:47
because sex is,
by definition,

79
4:50
an intimate part of our lives,
and it matters a lot.

80
4:56
Moreover, sex is fraught with
moral implications.

81
4:59
And since I'm talking about
this from, at least at the

82
5:03
beginning, from a Darwinian
evolutionary perspective,

83
5:06
I'm obliged to start off by
dealing with some of the moral

84
5:10
consequences and moral
implications.

85
5:13
So, for instance,
many biologists – all

86
5:16
biologists I would say – will
have argued that sexual

87
5:21
behavior,
sexual action,

88
5:24
sexual desire is,
to some extent,

89
5:25
a biological adaptation
existing to spread our genes.

90
5:29
From that perspective then,
non-procreative sex –

91
5:33
including gay sex,
sex with birth control,

92
5:37
sex by post-menopausal women
– does not serve this

93
5:43
reproductive goal and,
in some sense perhaps,

94
5:47
is unnatural.
And one might argue then,

95
5:50
"Does this mean it's wrong?"
We'll also be talking about sex

96
5:54
differences, differences between
men and women,

97
5:56
for instance,
in how much you want anonymous

98
6:00
sexual encounters,
differences between men and

99
6:03
women in social intelligence,
in aggression and empathy.

100
6:07
And regardless of what you
think about these differences,

101
6:11
whether you think they're right
or wrong or it doesn't matter,

102
6:16
you'll ask the question,
"To what extent are they

103
6:19
mutable?"
That is, if they exist through

104
6:22
Darwinian natural selection,
to what extent can we ever get

105
6:26
rid of them?
And I want to address those two

106
6:30
issues, the issues of morality
and inevitability,

107
6:33
from the very start.
And I want to start off

108
6:36
with--for each of them have a
quote by a prominent

109
6:40
evolutionary scholar.
So, the first one is by Steve

110
6:43
Pinker in How the Mind
Works.

111
6:45
And he writes, 
Nature does not dictate

112
6:49
what we should accept or how we
should live our lives.

113
6:52
Well into my procreating years,
I am so far voluntarily

114
6:55
childless, having squandered my
biological resources reading and

115
6:59
writing,
doing research,

116
7:00
helping friends and students,
and jogging in

117
7:03
circles--ignoring the solemn
imperative to spread my genes.

118
7:06
By Darwinian standards,
I am a horrible mistake,

119
7:09
a pathetic loser,
but I am happy to be that way,

120
7:13
and if my genes don't like it
they can go jump in the

121
7:17
lake.
Pinker's point,

122
7:18
I think, is a reasonable one.
It is true that certain things

123
7:22
we do exist to serve the
dictates of natural selection,

124
7:26
but that doesn't make them
right?

125
7:28
If you think that something is
only right if it leads to the

126
7:33
generation of more genes,
if it leads to reproduction,

127
7:36
then you're not going to think
very much about birth control.

128
7:39
You're not going to think very
much about any sort of

129
7:42
non-procreative sex.
On the other hand,

130
7:44
if you're--Moreover,
if you think something's wrong

131
7:47
if it's unnatural,
you're going to think much

132
7:51
about flying in a plane or
refrigerating food or surviving

133
7:54
a severe infection.
More generally,

134
7:57
our bodies and brains have
evolved for reproductive

135
8:00
success, but we can use these
brains to choose our own

136
8:03
destinies.
Nothing moral necessarily

137
8:06
follows from the facts of
biology.

138
8:08
That's all I'm going to say
about morality.

139
8:12
But I want you to keep it in
mind when we discuss different

140
8:15
claims about what's evolved and
what hasn't.

141
8:17
What about inevitability?
Here I want to turn to Richard

142
8:22
Dawkins.
Richard Dawkins writes,

143
8:24
If a child has had bad
teaching in mathematics,

144
8:27
it is accepted that a resulting
deficiency can be remedied by

145
8:30
extra-good teaching in the
following year.

146
8:33
But any suggestion that the
child's deficiency might have a

147
8:35
genetic origin is likely to be
greeted with something

148
8:38
approaching despair.
If it's in the genes,

149
8:41
it is determined and nothing
can be done about it.

150
8:44
This is pernicious nonsense on
an almost astrological scale.

151
8:48
Genetic causes and
environmental causes are in

152
8:50
principle no different from each
other.

153
8:53
Some may be harder to reverse,
others may be easy.

154
8:55
What did genes do to deserve
their sinister,

155
8:58
juggernaut-like reputation?
Why are genes thought to be so

156
9:02
much more fixed and inescapable
in their effects than

157
9:05
television, nuns or books.
I like the nuns.

158
9:09
And the point here is what
causes something is logically

159
9:16
separate from what can reverse
it.

160
9:21
And you can think of clear
cases where something is plainly

161
9:25
genetic but is fairly easily
reversed and where something is

162
9:29
cultural and is very difficult
to reverse.

163
9:32
Here's an example.
My eyesight is quite poor.

164
9:36
The reason why my eyesight is
quite poor is not due to the

165
9:40
patriarchy, television,
culture or "the man."

166
9:44
Rather, my eyesight is quite
poor due to the crappy genes Mom

167
9:48
and Dad gave me.
It is genetically determined if

168
9:50
anything is.
It is also fairly easy to fix.

169
9:53
There are these machines where
they put panes of glass in front

170
9:58
of your eyes and help you to see
better.

171
10:01
More advanced machines known as
contact lenses actually stick

172
10:04
the thing into your eyes,
and at the cost of occasional

173
10:07
infections you come to see
better.

174
10:10
It's biologically caused but
fairly easy to fix.

175
10:15
On the other hand,
take an example of society's

176
10:18
treatment of the obese.
It turns out when we – and

177
10:21
we'll get to this a little bit
when we talk about sexual

178
10:25
attractiveness – how thin
somebody is or how fat they are;

179
10:29
what you think of that is
actually not particularly

180
10:32
hard-wired.
It varies a lot from culture to

181
10:34
culture.
But once it's in a culture,

182
10:36
it is almost impossible to
shake.

183
10:39
So, the point,
there is just that genetic does

184
10:43
not mean inevitable,
and cultural does not mean easy

185
10:47
to fix.
Okay.

186
10:50
That's general background.
Let's start with basic Sex Ed.

187
10:53
What's the difference between
males and females?

188
10:56
Well, don't even think penis
and vagina.

189
11:02
There are a lot of animals that
have neither one.

190
11:05
And the difference actually
runs deeper.

191
11:07
By definition,
when biologists talk about

192
11:10
this, animals that are males
have a little sex cell,

193
11:14
which carries genes and nothing
else – sperm cells.

194
11:19
Animals that are females have a
big sex cell,

195
11:22
which has genes but also food
and a protective cover and all

196
11:26
sorts of other stuff.
Typically, the little sex cell

197
11:30
is much littler than the big sex
cell.

198
11:32
This is the only erotic picture
I'm going to show you today.

199
11:36
It's a bunch of these little
sperm circling around the egg.

200
11:42
It's romantic.
But this raises a puzzle.

201
11:48
I just described male and
female roughly in terms of a

202
11:51
size difference.
Males are the smaller of the

203
11:55
sex cells;
females are the bigger.

204
11:57
Why is it then that for so many
animals males are the bigger

205
12:02
ones, physically,
and the more aggressive ones.

206
12:06
This has been a puzzle that has
occupied scientists for a long,

207
12:09
long time.
And we're pretty--there is now

208
12:13
a pretty clear answer to it.
And the answer goes like this.

209
12:18
It is based on an idea by
Robert Trivers called "parental

210
12:24
investment."
And what parental investment

211
12:27
is, it's defined here as,
any investment that's going to

212
12:31
increase the offspring's chance
of survival at the cost of the

213
12:36
parent's ability to invest in
other offspring.

214
12:40
So, for example,
suppose an animal could create

215
12:43
an offspring by blinking an eye
and then the offspring would run

216
12:48
off?
That would be extremely little

217
12:50
investment.
Suppose another animal had to

218
12:53
work for ten years,
and during those ten years

219
12:57
could not create another
offspring.

220
12:59
That would be a huge investment.

221
13:01


222
13:04
Trivers points out that within
a species, females typically

223
13:09
have a much higher parental
investment than males.

224
13:13
Because females have these big
sex cells, they typically

225
13:17
incubate them internally.
They carry them.

226
13:21
If they're eggs,
they might have to sit on them.

227
13:23
And hence, each potential child
is a huge cost.

228
13:29
For males, which have the small
sex cell, you don't have the

229
13:33
same thing.
For males, it might just be a

230
13:37
few moments of copulation and
that's it.

231
13:40
If you could ask yourself,
for humans, each one of you in

232
13:44
the room, "What is the minimum
effort you can do to create a

233
13:48
child that has half your genes?"
And it's apparent that the male

234
13:53
investment, on average,
is lower than the female

235
13:57
investment.
Males can choose,

236
13:59
or might do better off in some
circumstances by putting a lot

237
14:02
of investment into their
offspring, but females don't

238
14:05
have a choice.
Females, barring technological

239
14:09
advance, have a huge investment
into any offspring;

240
14:13
not investment in the sense or
hard work and effort,

241
14:16
though there's that too.
Investment in the sense that

242
14:20
when you're--when you're
pregnant with one offspring,

243
14:24
you can't have another.
What this does is it has

244
14:28
ramifications that percolate
upwards.

245
14:31
So, it leads to different
psychologies.

246
14:37
Males--and a single male could
fertilize several females,

247
14:41
forcing some males to go
mate-less and giving rise to

248
14:45
competition to see who can mate
with the most females.

249
14:49
For females,
however, females can always

250
14:53
find mates.
So, sheer numbers don't count.

251
14:56
But there's competition to mate
with the right males,

252
15:00
those whose offspring have the
best chance of surviving.

253
15:05
The competition now explains
the puzzle we started with.

254
15:09
It explains why males are
typically larger,

255
15:12
and often why males have
evolved special weapons.

256
15:15
These special weapons evolved
for fighting other males for

257
15:18
reproductive access.
It also explains something else.

258
15:22
Females, biologically,
are choosy.

259
15:25
And so males have to compete
not merely with other males to

260
15:30
get reproductive access but also
to woo females.

261
15:35
And so often,
males have evolved special

262
15:39
displays like this ,
which exist only to be

263
15:42
beautiful, only to be attractive
and to attract mates.

264
15:47
This cold evolutionary logic
was captured in this cartoon,

265
15:54
which really does sum up a
hundred of mate-selection

266
15:59
research.

267
16:01


268
16:04
The logic goes like this then:
difference in the size of sex

269
16:08
cells leads to differences in
typical parental investment,

270
16:11
leading to differences in the
sorts of psychological and

271
16:14
physiological mechanisms that
evolved.

272
16:16
Okay, that's a good story.
What sort of evidence is there

273
16:20
for it?
Well, it turns out this could

274
16:22
explain some otherwise
surprising things.

275
16:24
For instance,
there should be--there are some

276
16:27
cases where the parental
investment is switched,

277
16:30
some cases where it turns
out--where the males end up with

278
16:34
more investment than the
females.

279
16:37
And it--and the theory predicts
that in these cases you should

280
16:43
get an asymmetry.
So, in cases like pipefish,

281
16:47
for instance,
the male takes the eggs into a

282
16:50
pouch and plugs them into his
bloodstream.

283
16:53
The females shoot off.
They have less of an investment

284
16:56
than the males.
In this case,

285
16:58
you would predict,
as is true, the females should

286
17:01
be larger, the females fight
other females more than males

287
17:05
fight males,
and the females try to compete

288
17:09
for the attention of the males.
Recall the movie "March of the

289
17:13
Penguins."
We saw a clip from it,

290
17:16
and this was in the context of
discussing the emotions that

291
17:20
have evolved toward our
offspring.

292
17:22
But remember the story and how
both the male and the female

293
17:26
have to go to tremendous lengths
to protect the egg.

294
17:30
And if one of them fails,
the egg dies and neither one

295
17:34
has it.
You should then not even have

296
17:37
to remember whether male
penguins are much bigger than

297
17:41
female penguins.
You should realize they should

298
17:44
not be, and in fact they aren't.
They're about the same size

299
17:47
because the parental is equal.
You should be able to predict

300
17:51
the size differences and
aggression differences based on

301
17:54
differing parental investment.
So for instance,

302
17:58
elephant seals are four
times--the males are enormous.

303
18:04
They're four times bigger than
the females.

304
18:06
And this is in large part
because elephant seals compete

305
18:10
for harems of females.
It's a "winner take all."

306
18:13
Gibbons are about the same size.
And this is because gibbons are

307
18:17
pretty monogamous;
they raise children together.

308
18:20


309
18:23
This illustrates something,
which is, it's not always the

310
18:28
case that male parental
investment is low.

311
18:32
There are some species,
including gibbons,

312
18:35
where it's in the male's
reproductive advantage to care

313
18:38
for the offspring.
Imagine a situation,

314
18:41
for instance,
where an offspring would die if

315
18:44
both parents didn't watch it for
many years and where the effort

316
18:49
devoted to that offspring had to
be exclusive.

317
18:53
If you focused on another
family or went away,

318
18:55
the offspring would die.
In that case,

319
18:57
you'd have equal investment.
It would matter equally to the

320
19:01
male and the female to invest in
their offspring,

321
19:04
and the cost would be the same.
There's no species--it's hard

322
19:08
to see species that have that
much of an equal system,

323
19:12
but some primates are close to
it.

324
19:14
And this raises the question
then, "What about humans?"

325
19:17
What about us?
What do we know about the

326
19:20
differences between males and
females?

327
19:22
Well, humans are a relatively
polygamous species.

328
19:30
Most cultures--most human
cultures are polygamous.

329
19:35
American culture is what they
call "serial monogamy."

330
19:40
So, we're not like some species
of birds.

331
19:42
We don't mate for life.
We do a series of peer-bondings

332
19:45
for some period of time.
It could be for life,

333
19:48
but indeed may not be and
usually isn't.

334
19:52
Males are bigger than females.
Human males--the size estimates

335
19:56
vary so much,
but the average human male is

336
19:58
about fifteen percent larger
than the average human female.

337
20:01
This suggests that there's
some--there's been,

338
20:04
in our evolutionary history,
some male-male competition for

339
20:08
access to females,
which suggests,

340
20:11
in turn, that the parental
investment is not quite equal.

341
20:15
Males have smaller testicles
for their body size than

342
20:19
chimpanzees, but larger
testicles than gorillas and

343
20:23
gibbons.
And this suggests that there

344
20:26
was some intermediate amount of
competition for the capacity to

345
20:30
create sperm.
And this is relevant for a

346
20:33
different sort of competition,
which regards the impregnation

347
20:36
of females that have multiple
mates.

348
20:38
And this suggests that over
evolutionary history women were

349
20:41
not wantonly promiscuous,
but were not entirely

350
20:44
monogamous either;
so much so that it paid from an

351
20:47
evolutionary point of view to
evolve--males to evolve the

352
20:51
capacity to produce more sperm
than other males.

353
20:55
Aggression.
Males are meaner.

354
20:57
I mean I'm summarizing here.
Meaner is not a technical term.

355
21:00
Yes, females can be meaner,
but males are at least more

356
21:03
physically violent.
They're more violent in the

357
21:07
womb, in utero;
they're more violent as

358
21:10
children, and they're more
violent as adults.

359
21:14
Again, this is not to say that
you can't find violent women or

360
21:19
non-violent men.
It's just on average there is

361
21:23
this difference.
They kick more;

362
21:25
males kick more in the uterus.
As children they're more

363
21:30
involved in play fighting and
violent combat-like sports.

364
21:33
And as adults,
wherever you go you will find a

365
21:37
prison.
And wherever you go you will

366
21:40
find that prison is mostly full
of men.

367
21:43
They are far more likely to
kill one another and to harm one

368
21:47
another.
Male sex hormones,

369
21:49
like testosterone,
are not the sort of thing one

370
21:52
would want to inject in somebody
unless you want them to turn

371
21:56
kind of mean.
They increase aggressiveness,

372
21:59
both in humans and in other
primates.

373
22:02
What about sexual choosiness?
Do male humans and female

374
22:09
humans differ in the extent to
which they will favor anonymous

375
22:16
sex?
And this is relevant from an

376
22:19
evolutionary perspective,
because the parental investment

377
22:22
theory predicts males should be
more receptive to anonymous sex.

378
22:26
Because for males,
to impregnate somebody else

379
22:30
might fortuitously lead to
another offspring;

380
22:35
it might be good for you and
doesn't carry the sort of harm

381
22:39
that females,
on the other hand,

382
22:40
have to be very picky.
Because they have to choose

383
22:44
carefully.
Remember, these systems evolved

384
22:47
before birth control and
vasectomies and so on.

385
22:50
So, what do we know
cross-culturally and

386
22:52
psychologically?
Well, prostitution is a

387
22:56
universally, or near
universally, male interest.

388
23:02
There are male prostitutes,
of course, but contrary to some

389
23:06
various fantasies and sitcoms,
they cater to male customers.

390
23:11
Pornography is a human
universal.

391
23:14
In every society,
males have done some sort of

392
23:18
depictions of naked females for
the purposes of arousal.

393
23:23
Often they carve them into
trees or do sort of sculptures.

394
23:27
One of the weirdest findings in
the last decade or so is that

395
23:32
this extends as well to monkey
porn.

396
23:35
And so, some scientists at Duke
set up a situation where monkeys

397
23:39
could pay in fruit juice,
by giving up fruit juice,

398
23:43
to look a picture either of the
female's hindquarters or of a

399
23:47
celebrity monkey,
a socially dominant monkey,

400
23:50
some sort of combination of
People Magazine and

401
23:54
Penthouse.
And so, there's some interest

402
23:57
in this even by non-human
primates.

403
23:59


404
24:03
What about actually preference
for sexual variety?

405
24:06
Well, you can get at this in
different ways.

406
24:10
There is what biologists
describe as the "Coolidge

407
24:16
Effect."
I have this here.

408
24:18
And the Coolidge Effect is
based on President Calvin

409
24:21
Coolidge.
And it's a story about Calvin

410
24:23
Coolidge and his wife,
who were being shown around a

411
24:27
farm separately.
And the person showing around

412
24:30
his wife pointed out that there
were a lot of hens;

413
24:33
she noticed that there were a
lot of hens but only one

414
24:36
rooster.
And she asked the guy showing

415
24:38
her around, "Is one rooster
enough?"

416
24:40
And the guys said,
"Well, you know,

417
24:42
the rooster works very hard.
The rooster has sex dozens of

418
24:45
times a day."
And she said,

419
24:46
"Well, be sure to tell that to
the president."

420
24:48
The story goes,
the president went around,

421
24:51
the guy tells the story to the
president.

422
24:54
The president asks the man,
"Huh.

423
24:56
Has sex dozens of times each
day.

424
24:58
Same hen every time?"
The guy says,

425
25:01
"No, different hen every time."
And he says,

426
25:04
"Tell that to Mrs.
Coolidge."

427
25:06
Now, there are two responses to
this sort of story,

428
25:10
and they're both kind of
negative.

429
25:13
One thing is,
"Well, everybody knows males

430
25:15
prefer anonymous sex with
strange women.

431
25:17
Duh."
The other response is,

432
25:20
"That's sexist claptrap."
You might think--you might be a

433
25:25
male and say,
"That's not me."

434
25:27
You might know males and say,
"The males I know are not like

435
25:30
that."
So, how do you find out?

436
25:32
Well, there are indirect
measures, such who goes to

437
25:35
prostitutes.
But there are also fairly

438
25:37
direct measures.
One fairly direct measure is

439
25:40
you could ask people in
anonymous surveys.

440
25:43
So, in fact,
I'll give you some anonymous

441
25:46
surveys.
I'm not going to ask people.

442
25:47
And you just ask them.
So, for instance,

443
25:50
I want everybody to consider
this question.

444
25:56
How many sexual partners do you
want to have in the next month?

445
25:59
What is it--we're coming up to
April.

446
26:02
How many sexual partners do you
want in April?

447
26:04
Next two years?
Take many of you through

448
26:10
graduation.
When you leave Yale,

449
26:12
what do you want--like,
"I had X sexual partners,

450
26:14
and that's what I wanted."
Or your lifetime?

451
26:17
We get people to answer these
questions.

452
26:20
Professor Chun last year in
this course had clickers,

453
26:24
and he got people to do it.
We are not so high tech,

454
26:28
so we'll just do it in our
heads.

455
26:30
But here is the way the answers
come out.

456
26:32
Women say less than one in the
next month.

457
26:35
That doesn't mean they want
less than one;

458
26:36
that means many of them--many
of them say zero,

459
26:40
some say one and so on.
One--four to five.

460
26:46
Men--two, eight, eighteen.
You can ask other questions

461
26:55
from this population.
So, you could ask,

462
26:58
"Would you have sex with a
desirable partner you have

463
27:01
known--so somebody really
desirable--for a year;

464
27:04
women say yes,
six months--unsure,

465
27:08
week or less--no.
Men [laughter]--and with men

466
27:14
you could get a majority going
to five minutes.

467
27:21
This is all Q &
A, pen and pencil sort of

468
27:25
things.
Some brave scientists have

469
27:28
actually done experiments.
And in one experiment

470
27:30
somebody--I don't,
you know, this is the sort of

471
27:33
thing which you probably
wouldn't do nowadays.

472
27:36
This work has been done ten
years ago, where they have an

473
27:39
incredibly attractive man and an
incredibly attractive woman and

474
27:42
they approach people on campus.
They're not from campus;

475
27:45
they're actors brought in.
And they go to people,

476
27:48
to strangers,
and they say,

477
27:49
"I've been noticing you around
campus.

478
27:51
I find you very attractive.
Would you go out with me

479
27:55
tonight?
Would you come over to my

480
27:56
apartment tonight?
Would you go to bed with me

481
27:58
tonight?"
The experiment you wouldn't

482
28:01
think anybody would've done has
been done, and women about--a

483
28:05
very attractive man,
over half of the women

484
28:08
approached say,
"Yeah, I will."

485
28:11
Very few agree to this ["Would
you come to my apartment

486
28:12
tonight?"], and nobody agrees to
this ["Would you go to bed with

487
28:14
me tonight?"].
For men, the data are like

488
28:17
this, they go up to there and
then up to there .

489
28:20


490
28:26
In this study,
the twenty five percent of

491
28:30
males who said "no" apologized
profusely,

492
28:34
and they said,
"Oh, you know,

493
28:37
my fiancé's in town,
and [unintelligible]."

494
28:42
What about behavior?
Well, you--if we're interested

495
28:47
in sex differences,
you can't actually figure out

496
28:52
what people want,
male female differences,

497
28:56
by looking at simply at the
average number of times people

498
28:59
have sex because if males and
females have different

499
29:02
priorities,
then heterosexual sex is a

500
29:05
compromise between two groups of
people with competing interests.

501
29:09
What's a more clear reflection
then is gay sex between two

502
29:15
women or between two men,
because then you get a pure

503
29:21
reflection of sexual desire.
Now, the data here tend to be

504
29:26
very messy.
Again, they're survey studies

505
29:29
but by and large every study
done tends to find a difference

506
29:32
in the expected direction,
which is that females tend to

507
29:36
be--lesbians tend to be much
more monogamous than gay men.

508
29:42
Some studies prior to AIDS –
this was many years ago –

509
29:46
found gay men to be extremely
promiscuous,

510
29:50
often having over a hundred or
over a thousand partners.

511
29:53
You wouldn't find this sort of
promiscuity in females.

512
29:56
And a way to think about this
is, what these gay men are doing

513
30:00
is exactly what your average
heterosexual man would do if he

514
30:05
had that degree of willing
females who were as willing as

515
30:08
he was.
And this all suggests that

516
30:11
there's some sort of difference
along lines expected in sexual

517
30:15
choosiness in humans.
What about sexual

518
30:19
attractiveness?
What about mate preference?

519
30:23
What do we find attractive?
Well, unlike the choosiness

520
30:26
studies, here we actually have
some pretty good cross-cultural

521
30:30
data.
So one study,

522
30:32
for instance,
was done in 10,000 people from

523
30:35
thirty-seven countries,
asking people,

524
30:38
"Who do you want to be with?"
And there are different

525
30:41
studies, some of them asking,
"Who do you want to marry?"

526
30:44
Other studies,
"Who do you want as a mate?

527
30:46
Who do you want as a sexual
partner?"

528
30:48
And one main finding is kind of
reassuring, everybody likes

529
30:53
kindness and intelligence,
or at least everybody says they

530
30:57
like kindness and intelligence.
These are valued pretty highly.

531
31:02
But at the same time,
there are sex differences.

532
31:05
Females focus more on power and
status and more on interest in

533
31:10
investing in children.
And think about that from an

534
31:13
evolutionary point of view and
it makes sense.

535
31:15
It doesn't matter hugely,
from the standpoint of

536
31:18
reproduction,
how old the man is.

537
31:20
The difference between fifteen
and twenty-five and thirty-five

538
31:23
and forty-five may matter a lot
for his status in the community,

539
31:27
his physical strength,
his lifespan but from the

540
31:29
standpoint of his sperm it
doesn't matter hugely.

541
31:32
Later on there's a drop off and
it does begin to matter,

542
31:35
but it doesn't matter hugely.
What does matter is his

543
31:38
interest in being a good father,
in protecting you from

544
31:42
predation,
from murder,

545
31:44
from assault by other people,
and in taking care of the kid.

546
31:48
Women's brains are wired up to
find males with those

547
31:52
properties.
Similarly, males focus a little

548
31:55
bit differently.
They're more interested in all

549
31:58
of these things,
but also on the ability to have

550
32:01
children.
So, from an evolutionary point

551
32:03
of view, there's actually a very
big difference between a

552
32:06
twenty-year old and a fifty-year
old,

553
32:08
from a male standpoint looking
at a female, because the one can

554
32:11
have offspring and the other
cannot.

555
32:13
So, this is a difference.
But what I want to focus more

556
32:18
on right now is back to another
similarity.

557
32:21
Everybody likes beauty.
And I want to devote a little

558
32:27
bit of this lecture to talking
about physical beauty.

559
32:30
Physical beauty,
as these beautiful people say,

560
32:34
is a curse.
So she--she's like a big model,

561
32:38
a supermodel,
maybe even a

562
32:40
super-supermodel--points out the
arbitrariness of finding her

563
32:44
devastatingly beautiful.
Famous actor points out how

564
32:49
frustrating it is that people
only ignore his accomplishments

565
32:52
and focus merely on his physical
beauty.

566
32:55
This is very frustrating.
So what is beauty?

567
33:00
What does this mean we say we
find--you know,

568
33:04
yeah, they really are very
attractive people.

569
33:08
What is it about that that
makes you look and say,

570
33:11
"Yeah, that makes sense?"
Well, we kind of know the

571
33:14
answer.
We know some universals.

572
33:16
Beauty seems to signal two
things.

573
33:19
Beauty seems to signal youth--I
mean, not pre-school youth,

574
33:27
but youth like sexually mature
but young.

575
33:33
And so the cues we find
beautiful are cues to that –

576
33:37
large eyes, full lips,
smooth, tight skin.

577
33:41
Beauty signals something else.
Beauty is a marker for health.

578
33:45
And so what we find beautiful,
things like the absence of

579
33:50
deformities, clear eyes,
unblemished skin,

580
33:53
intact teeth – that's very
big – and an average face.

581
33:59
And that last part might seem a
little bit strange.

582
34:02
What would be so good about an
average face?

583
34:05
And there are different answers
to that, but one answer is,

584
34:09
an average face,
on average, should be

585
34:11
considered attractive because
any sort of deformities are

586
34:16
variations from the average.
And if you average every face

587
34:21
together, you get a face
that--where nothing bad has

588
34:24
happened to it.
There's no distortion,

589
34:27
there's no deviation.
As one gets older,

590
34:30
the face gets less symmetrical
and so on.

591
34:34
Average-ness seems to factor
out all the bad things that

592
34:38
could happen.
Good theory.

593
34:40
How do we know it's true?
Well, there's a photo roster

594
34:44
that comes--that I have access
to for this class.

595
34:49
So, I can look at each of your
pictures, and I will make you a

596
34:53
bet about who has the most
beautiful face in this course.

597
34:56
The bet is it would be all of
you.

598
35:01
Aw.
Wouldn't it be funny if I

599
35:06
shouted out somebody's name?
And you know,

600
35:10
A) I don't have the energy to
do this, and B) it would

601
35:13
probably violate four hundred
different privacy laws or

602
35:16
whatever.
But if I took all those faces

603
35:19
and morphed them together,
I would get a very pretty face.

604
35:23
And how do we know this?
Well, people have done this.

605
35:27
They've done it with--so look
at the faces from here to here.

606
35:32
And if you are like most
people, you see as you're going

607
35:35
to the right they're looking
better and better and better.

608
35:38
It's subtle,
but it's actually not so subtle

609
35:42
that babies don't notice it.
The same researchers who

610
35:46
constructed this--these
face--these average Caucasian

611
35:49
faces,
male and female,

612
35:50
have shown these faces to
babies and find that babies that

613
35:54
prefer to look at average
faces--suggesting that our

614
35:57
preference for averaging is not
the product of culture but

615
36:01
rather is to some extent
hard-wired.

616
36:04
These two people don't exist.
They're computer composites.

617
36:09
They're a heavily averaged male
face and a heavily averaged

618
36:14
female face, both from a
Caucasian data sample.

619
36:18
They don't look bad right?
They're good faces.

620
36:21
They don't cheat.
So the hair,

621
36:23
for instance,
is identical--so they

622
36:24
don't--you can't use hair cues.
But they're pretty attractive.

623
36:28
But the story of attractiveness
does not end there.

624
36:32
How do you get a better than
average face?

625
36:35
What can you do to these faces,
these average faces,

626
36:38
and make them look even better?
Well, I'll have a vote.

627
36:42
Who's prettier?
Who says the one on the right?

628
36:46
Who says the one on the left?
Left is average face,

629
36:51
and there might be variation in
this class.

630
36:53
There are definitely variations
in what people favor.

631
36:58
This is a feminized version of
the average face where certain

632
37:02
prototype features were made
more feminine than average to

633
37:05
cue this as more of a sexual
object.

634
37:07
This is more complicated.

635
37:09


636
37:21
Who thinks face A is more
attractive?

637
37:30
Who thinks face B is more
attractive?

638
37:33
Okay.
Most people like face B.

639
37:39
The exception is,
and this has been statistically

640
37:42
replicated, I think,
now in three labs.

641
37:45
Face A is preferred by women
who are ovulating,

642
37:50
and the story about why is
complicated and will take us

643
37:56
beyond the scope of this class.
But currently the idea is that

644
38:01
this is a really handsome guy;
he's young, he's healthy,

645
38:04
he looks strong,
good provider;

646
38:06
this guy is really hot,
and he may not be a good

647
38:10
provider and everything,
but I'm sure he has wonderful

648
38:14
genes.
So, the idea is that one should

649
38:17
have sex with him and then have
him raise the kids.

650
38:20


651
38:24
We've talked so far about
things, about sex and sexual

652
38:28
attractiveness largely from a
biological perspective,

653
38:32
looking at universals.
And in fact,

654
38:35
there are some universals in
what men and women have in

655
38:38
common and what distinguishes
men and women.

656
38:40
And in some of the sex
differences, particularly

657
38:44
related to aggression and mate
preference, seem to be

658
38:48
universal.
They seem to show up to some

659
38:51
extent across every culture you
look at and, hence,

660
38:54
are likely candidates for
biological adaptations.

661
38:57
But there are other sex
differences that people are

662
39:01
aware of where the origins are
far less clear.

663
39:05
And I think that intelligent,
reasonable people could

664
39:08
disagree about this,
but I am personally quite

665
39:11
skeptical about the extent to
which these reflect biology.

666
39:14
I'll mention them to capture
the debate, but the thing to

667
39:20
keep in mind here is that
biology,

668
39:24
natural selection,
is one reason why the men in

669
39:27
this class might differ from the
women in this class.

670
39:30
But of course,
there are other,

671
39:31
social, factors.
Babies are treated differently.

672
39:34
There have been many studies
where you take a baby and

673
39:37
swaddle it in blue and describe
it as a boy versus swaddle it in

674
39:41
pink and describe it as a girl,
and people treat it differently

675
39:44
when they think it's a boy than
when they think it's a girl.

676
39:47
You're treated differently too.
It matters a lot--and there's

677
39:53
study after study suggesting,
for instance,

678
39:56
that when you send an email or
a job application or a paper to

679
40:00
a scientific journal,
it matters whether it has the

680
40:05
name John Smith on it versus the
name Joan Smith.

681
40:10
It matters because people have
different expectations and

682
40:13
different reactions to males
versus females.

683
40:16
Some if you may have firsthand
experience with this if you're a

684
40:20
man with a name that could be
taken as a woman's name –

685
40:24
friend of mine is named Lynn,
and often people think he's

686
40:27
female – or if you're a woman
who has a name that could be

687
40:30
taken as a man's name,
or if you have a name

688
40:33
sufficiently foreign to Western
ears that people can't easily

689
40:37
tell.
You'll often find people

690
40:39
saying, "Oh," people are
high-fiving each other there

691
40:43
--you'll often find some degree
of surprise and some degree of

692
40:48
people saying,
"Oh my, I didn't know you were

693
40:51
a man.
Now I will treat you

694
40:53
differently."
And so, these social factors

695
40:56
could play a role in explaining
some male and female

696
41:00
differences.
Also, there are the facts of

697
41:03
gender self-segregation.
So here something very

698
41:06
interesting happens
developmentally.

699
41:08
Males segregate with other
males;

700
41:12
females segregate with other
females--for a period lasting,

701
41:16
it depends on the culture,
but say from age four to age

702
41:20
eleven.
This self-segregation might

703
41:24
exaggerate and enhance sex
differences.

704
41:27
It might be,
for instance,

705
41:28
as Eleanor Maccoby has
proposed, that boys are slightly

706
41:31
more aggressive than girls.
But then boys go into groups of

707
41:35
boys, and that enhances and
exaggerates their aggression

708
41:39
while the girls' non-aggressive
behavior is enhanced and

709
41:42
exaggerated in different ways by
them falling into girls' groups.

710
41:47
So, what sort of differences
are we talking about when we say

711
41:51
we're not sure of their cause?
Well, one difference is one in

712
41:55
empathy.
So Simon Baron-Cohen wrote a

713
41:58
wonderful book called The
Essential Difference where

714
42:03
he argues that men are by nature
less empathetic,

715
42:07
women are by nature more
empathetic, and that this is a

716
42:12
core sex difference.
So, what do you know?

717
42:16
Well, what's the source for
this?

718
42:17
One thing is men are more
violent.

719
42:20
Simon Baron-Cohen describes
violence as the ultimate

720
42:23
act--murder as the ultimate act
of a lack of empathy.

721
42:27
There's some relationship
between how much testosterone

722
42:32
you have in your system and how
social you are – more

723
42:37
testosterone,
less social.

724
42:39
Boys tend to be less empathetic
than girls, and there's some

725
42:43
evidence, though it's not
conclusive,

726
42:46
that boys do worse than girls
on social cognition theory of

727
42:50
mind tasks.
That's what I have here,

728
42:53
though that is quite debated.
And the biggest effect,

729
42:57
which isn't debated at all,
is problems with empathy,

730
43:02
problems of social cognition,
are much more frequent in men

731
43:07
than in women.
So, these disorders like

732
43:11
autism, Asperger's Syndrome,
conduct disorder and

733
43:14
psychopathy are predominately
male.

734
43:17
And Simon Baron-Cohen suggests
that--basically,

735
43:21
he has this slogan where he
says, "To be a man is to suffer

736
43:26
from a particularly mild form of
autism."

737
43:29
That males are just socially
clueless relative to women.

738
43:34
Final bit of trivia--This is
Simon Baron Cohen,

739
43:38
who is a very famous
developmental psychologist,

740
43:43
but his cousin Sasha Baron
Cohen is far more famous.

741
43:48
Another debate is a debate
concerning sex differences in

742
43:52
the capacity for math and
science.

743
43:54
A few years ago there used to
be a president of Harvard known

744
43:59
as Larry Summers.
There are so many reasons to

745
44:03
hiss at this point.
And Larry Summers is no longer

746
44:08
president of Harvard for various
reasons, but one reason was this

747
44:13
quote,
which included in his

748
44:15
speculations about sex
differences, "...in the special

749
44:18
case of science and engineering,
there are issues of intrinsic

750
44:21
aptitude, and particularly of
the variability of aptitude..."

751
44:25
He argued, or suggested,
that the under-representation

752
44:28
of women in the sciences in
academia is because of an

753
44:32
intrinsic aptitude difference;
women are, on average,

754
44:37
less biologically predisposed
to do this sort of reasoning.

755
44:42
The variability point is that
he wasn't suggesting that

756
44:45
there's just a difference on
average.

757
44:48
In fact, he agreed that the
average skills of men and women

758
44:51
are identical.
The claim is that males show

759
44:55
more variation.
This means that there are more

760
44:58
male retarded people and more
males who are just horribly bad

761
45:01
at this, but it also means there
are more male geniuses.

762
45:05
And he suggested that this
plays a role.

763
45:08
This, as you can imagine,
proved to be an extremely

764
45:11
controversial claim,
and rather than go through it

765
45:14
– because it would take me a
class to treat the pros and cons

766
45:18
of this argument responsibly –
I'm going to refer you to a

767
45:21
wonderful debate between Steve
Pinker,

768
45:24
who was quoted earlier,
and Liz Spelke who's one of the

769
45:28
big infant cognition people.
And we spoke a lot about her

770
45:31
work earlier on in the course.
And they have a wonderful

771
45:34
debate between two of the
smartest people I know on The

772
45:37
Edge,
which was done at Harvard about

773
45:41
a year ago and is on video here
.

774
45:44
So, if you're interested in sex
differences and different

775
45:47
theories about the mechanism of
sex differences,

776
45:50
this is where you should go.
Finally, and a final topic,

777
45:55
some of us, about 98%--and the
numbers are very difficult to

778
46:02
pin down.
Maybe it isn't 98%;

779
46:05
maybe it's ninety-seven,
maybe it's ninety-nine.

780
46:08
Let's say 98% of women are
sexually attracted to men.

781
46:14
About 96% of men are sexually
attracted to women.

782
46:20
And the numbers vary and it's
very difficult to estimate it

783
46:23
properly.
As you could imagine,

784
46:24
there are all sorts of problems
with this sort of research.

785
46:27
But there's some proportion of
the population that's

786
46:30
exclusively homosexual--some
proportion of the population of

787
46:33
men who are only attracted to
other men,

788
46:35
some proportion of the
population of women who are only

789
46:38
attracted to other women.
When people talk about sexual

790
46:42
orientation here,
it's important to realize we

791
46:45
are not talking here about
behavior.

792
46:48
There are all sorts of reasons
why somebody might have sex with

793
46:52
somebody of the same sex.
You know, they might be bored.

794
46:56
You may, you know,
be experimenting,

795
46:58
be whatever.
The question is,

796
46:59
"What do you want to do?"
All things being equal,

797
47:02
what sort of person--if you
could be sexually or

798
47:05
romantically involved with any
person, who would it be?

799
47:08
And most people are
heterosexual.

800
47:11
There's a considerable amount
that varies cross-culturally of

801
47:14
people who are bisexual.
But the real puzzle is

802
47:17
exclusive homosexuality.
So, why?

803
47:20
Well, nobody knows.
We know some reasons,

804
47:24
some answers are probably not
right.

805
47:27
It is not the case,
almost certainly – maybe

806
47:30
there are some exceptions –
but it is not the case that

807
47:33
people choose their sexual
orientation.

808
47:36
I'm not going to do this in
this room, but if you asked

809
47:39
people to raise their hands as
to how many people decided who

810
47:43
to become sexually attracted to,
very few people would.

811
47:48
Part of the issue rises in the
fact that people who are gay are

812
47:52
often extremely discriminated
against, and they have no wish

813
47:56
to be gay.
They might even think it's

814
47:59
morally wrong for them to be
that way.

815
48:00
That makes it implausible that
their sexual orientation is a

816
48:04
conscious choice.
What about experience after

817
48:09
puberty?
So, there is a view that keeps

818
48:12
coming up over and over again in
the literature that people who

819
48:16
are gay have in some sense been
seduced by people,

820
48:19
by other people--or something
happened to them afterwards.

821
48:22
This seems unlikely.
There are in particular the

822
48:26
seeds of sexual orientation
later on in life seem to show up

823
48:31
quite early in life.
Again, the studies are sort of

824
48:35
suspect, but there's some reason
to believe that people who are

825
48:39
gay and people who are straight
are different long before they

826
48:42
hit puberty with regard to their
sexual and romantic fantasies.

827
48:46
You would now expect me to say,
"Well, being gay and being

828
48:50
straight is built in.
It's hard-wired.

829
48:53
None of these stories seem
right.

830
48:55
It seems to be built in."
And the answer to that is,

831
48:59
sort of.
So, if you do the standard

832
49:01
behavioral genetic tests,
and you by now know how to do

833
49:05
them--you'd look for differences
between monozygotic and

834
49:09
dizygotic twins,
you'd do the adoption

835
49:12
comparison--you know adopted
siblings and biological

836
49:15
siblings.
The answer is yes,

837
49:17
you find that there is some
sort of genetic predisposition

838
49:21
towards homosexuality.
But it can't be entirely

839
49:27
genetic.
One reason why it can't be

840
49:31
entirely genetic is,
if I'm gay and I have an

841
49:34
identical twin,
the odds that my identical twin

842
49:38
will be gay--it's about fifty
percent.

843
49:41
Those are very high odds
compared to the average in the

844
49:44
population.
But if it was truly genetic,

845
49:47
entirely genetic,
what should the number be?

846
49:51
A hundred percent – he's my
clone.

847
49:54
He should be exactly as I am.
And it's not.

848
49:57
So, we know then that some sort
of experience,

849
50:01
possibly prenatal experience,
is what explains it.

850
50:05
Why is it so – I said before
this is a huge puzzle – why is

851
50:10
it such a huge puzzle?
Well, exclusive homosexuality

852
50:15
is an evolutionary mystery.
Again, do not think that this

853
50:20
carries any moral weight to it.
What it does mean though is

854
50:24
that it doesn't seem to follow
as a biological adaptation.

855
50:28
The puzzle is not why is it
that some men have sex with men.

856
50:34
That's not a big puzzle.
Maybe they have sex with men as

857
50:37
some sort of recreational things
or pair bonding or whatever.

858
50:39
That's not the puzzle.
The puzzle is why are there

859
50:43
some men who don't want to have
sex with women?

860
50:47
Similarly, why are there some
women who don't want to have sex

861
50:51
with men?
From an evolutionary adaptive

862
50:54
standpoint, you would think that
the genes that give rise to such

863
50:58
a behavior would be weeded out
because creatures with that

864
51:02
behavior typically,
putting aside modern

865
51:05
technology, don't have
offspring.

866
51:07
And that's what makes it such a
puzzle.

867
51:10
So, your reading response for
this week is "solve that

868
51:14
puzzle."
I know I said early on in the

869
51:17
course that reading responses
would be really easy and just

870
51:19
require you reciting back
things,

871
51:21
but that proved to be too
boring.

872
51:23
So, just solve this deepest of
all puzzle.

873
51:26
The thing in brackets at the
end is very important.

874
51:29
Your account,
whatever it is,

875
51:31
should bear some relationship
to the facts as discussed in

876
51:35
lectures and readings.
We have about five more minutes.

877
51:40
Any questions or thoughts?
Yes?

878
51:44
Student:
I like your leather jacket.

879
51:46
Professor Paul Bloom:
Thank you very much.

880
51:48
She likes my leather jacket.
Any questions or thoughts,

881
51:54
just like that one?
No.

882
51:56
Yes?
Student:

883
51:59
My question's not exactly like
that one, but in other animals

884
52:05
do they--is there similar data
on other species?

885
52:09
Professor Paul Bloom: On
sexual preferences?

886
52:11
That's a very good question
because certainly your answer to

887
52:14
the origin – give me two more
minutes – certainly your

888
52:17
answer about the origin of
sexual preference in humans will

889
52:20
be informed by the question of
cross-species data.

890
52:23
What we do know is that there
are many animals that engage in

891
52:27
homosexual behavior;
they engage in sex with members

892
52:30
of their own sex.
What I don't know is whether

893
52:32
you get exclusive homosexual
behavior.

894
52:35
So, I don't know what the rate
is in nonhuman primates,

895
52:38
for instance,
of primates who do not want to

896
52:41
have sex with members of the
opposite sex.

897
52:43
Okay, I'll see you all
Wednesday.
