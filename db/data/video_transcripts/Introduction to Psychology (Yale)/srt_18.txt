Professor Paul Bloom: I
am extremely pleased to

2
0:15
introduce the fourth and final
guest lecture of the semester.

3
0:18
Professor Susan Nolen-Hoeksema.
Susan is a professor in the

4
0:24
Department of Psychology and the
Director of Graduate Studies.

5
0:28
She is well known for her work
in clinical psychology and

6
0:33
especially her research in
depression,

7
0:35
the nature and causes of people
with depression,

8
0:39
with special focus on sex
differences in depression.

9
0:43
She basically does everything
someone can do.

10
0:48
She is a noted scientist,
winning many awards and

11
0:51
publishing massive amounts of
work in scientific journals.

12
0:54
She is an award-winning teacher
and has authored what,

13
0:58
in my mind, is the very best
textbook in her area.

14
1:02
And she's a noted popular
writer who has written popular

15
1:06
and accessible books bringing
the message and ideas and

16
1:10
theories of clinical psychology
to the broader public.

17
1:14
The only other thing I'll
mention before we welcome her is

18
1:17
that she's going to teach next
year her course in clinical

19
1:20
psychology,
which has a superb reputation

20
1:22
as an extremely interesting
course.

21
1:24
If you are interested in what
you hear today and you want to

22
1:27
learn more about it,
that's the course you should

23
1:29
take.
So, let's please welcome Dr.

24
1:34
Susan Nolen-Hoeksema.
[applause]

25
1:37
Professor Susan
Nolen-Hoeksema: Thank you

26
1:38
Paul.
Can everybody hear me okay?

27
1:40
Okay.
So, what I want to do today is

28
1:43
to give you a very brief
overview of how modern clinical

29
1:46
psychology looks at mental
disorders,

30
1:49
some of the ways we think about
what constitutes a mental

31
1:52
disorder, some of the
characteristics that kind of cut

32
1:55
across mental disorders,
and then I'm going to use the

33
1:59
case of mood disorders,
that is depression and what is

34
2:02
now called bipolar disorder,
what you may know more

35
2:05
popularly as manic-depression,
as sort of examples of how we

36
2:09
think about a particular set of
disorders and some of the ways

37
2:13
we go about researching the
theories -- different theories

38
2:17
for the disorders and some of
the prominent treatments for

39
2:21
disorders these days.
Okay?

40
2:24
So, I'm going to do both a fair
amount of lecturing,

41
2:28
and then I've got lots of video
clips to show you as well.

42
2:31
So, I'm going to be roaming
around and changing venues here

43
2:36
fairly often.
So, the first and most

44
2:38
fundamental question in clinical
psychology is,

45
2:42
"What is abnormality?"
Where do we draw the line

46
2:46
between normal,
healthy, typical behavior and

47
2:49
what we might want to call
abnormal,

48
2:52
atypical, deviant,
unhealthy, maladaptive mental

49
2:57
problems?
We tend to have an intuitive

50
3:01
sense of what we mean by
abnormality, and we'd like to

51
3:04
believe--a lot of people who
come into my course say,

52
3:09
"Well, of course,
you know, you guys have figured

53
3:10
it out.
You know where to draw the line.

54
3:12
You have criteria.
You have blood tests, right?

55
3:15
--that tell me whether I have
depression or schizophrenia or

56
3:18
one of the things I've read
about."

57
3:19
Well, the reality is that we
don't.

58
3:22
First of all,
there is no biological test for

59
3:25
any of the known mental
disorders right now.

60
3:28
And instead what we have is a
set of behavioral criteria for

61
3:34
how to diagnose different mental
disorders.

62
3:38
And what I mean by behavioral
criteria is a set of symptoms

63
3:42
that the person reports to you
about how they feel,

64
3:46
how they think,
and a set of observations about

65
3:49
their behavior and how typical
or atypical it is.

66
3:53
And you take the sort of set of
symptoms the person shows or

67
3:57
reports, and you match them up
against the existing criteria

68
4:00
for different mental disorders.
And then it comes down to a

69
4:05
fairly subjective judgment call
about whether the person meets

70
4:10
the criteria or not.
Unfortunately,

71
4:13
these judgment calls,
because they are so subjective,

72
4:15
can be influenced by a lot of
factors.

73
4:18
And we won't have a chance to
go into these too much today,

74
4:21
but just to highlight a few of
them.

75
4:24
The first is social norms.
Whether you get labeled as

76
4:28
having a mental disorder or a
problem depends very heavily on

77
4:32
what your social or cultural
norms are.

78
4:35
So, a woman wearing a veil in a
Muslim community or culture

79
4:41
would be seen as typical,
even prescribed,

80
4:45
behavior.
Whereas a woman wearing a veil

81
4:48
in a non-Muslim culture,
especially until fairly

82
4:51
recently, was often looked upon
as very atypical or abnormal

83
4:56
behavior.
The second kind of thing that

84
4:59
gets--that influences whether
something is called normal or

85
5:03
abnormal is certain
characteristics of the target

86
5:07
person.
In particular,

87
5:09
I've highlighted here,
gender.

88
5:11
Whether you're a man or you're
a woman really influences how

89
5:16
unusual a certain behavior is.
So, crying is a good example.

90
5:22
A man crying in our culture is
seen as fairly unusual,

91
5:26
whereas a woman crying is seen
as much less unusual.

92
5:30
On the other hand,
a woman beating up someone is

93
5:33
taken as quite unusual behavior
where it's less unusual for a

94
5:38
man.
So, we have gender stereotypes,

95
5:41
gender roles for what is
acceptable behavior,

96
5:45
and our judgments as to whether
something is normal or abnormal

97
5:48
get influenced by those gender
roles.

98
5:50
And the third thing that can
influence whether something is

99
5:55
labeled abnormal or not is the
context.

100
5:59
And here I'm giving you the
example of "paranoia."

101
6:02
If you're paranoid and
hyper-vigilant,

102
6:05
looking for threat in downtown
Baghdad,

103
6:08
that's considered very adaptive
behavior these days because it

104
6:12
could prevent you from getting
hurt or killed.

105
6:15
Whereas, if you're in a quiet
little farm in Central

106
6:19
Connecticut, being extremely
paranoid and believing there's

107
6:23
someone who's going to shoot you
around the corner is not

108
6:27
considered as normal or as
acceptable or adaptive behavior.

109
6:31
So, the context in which you
exhibit a particular behavior

110
6:35
also can heavily influence
whether it gets labeled by

111
6:39
others as normal or abnormal.
In the field of clinical

112
6:44
psychology we have a number of
different ways,

113
6:48
kind of heuristics that we use
to label things as abnormal or

114
6:55
unhealthy or troubling.
And three of these

115
6:59
characteristics are what we
often call the three Ds:

116
7:03
distress, dysfunction,
and deviance.

117
7:07
So, behaviors that cause the
individual or others significant

118
7:11
distress often get labeled as
abnormal or unhealthy.

119
7:16
Depression is a prime example,
as we'll see when we talk about

120
7:19
the characteristics of it.
It's a miserable state of being;

121
7:22
you're unhappy,
you're sad, you may even feel

122
7:26
so badly you want to kill
yourself.

123
7:28
And that very,
very high level of distress is

124
7:32
part of the reason why it's
labeled as a mental disorder.

125
7:36
Other mental disorders don't
cause the individual distress,

126
7:39
but they may cause other people
distress.

127
7:42
So, one example of this is
something called "antisocial

128
7:46
personality disorder,"
where the individual has no

129
7:50
regard for the rights of other
people, has no hesitation to

130
7:56
steal or--steal from or hurt
other people,

131
8:01
has no empathy or sympathy for
other people's feelings and so

132
8:05
can inflict a lot of harm on
other people and has absolutely

133
8:09
no distress over this
whatsoever.

134
8:11
But this behavior causes other
people distress,

135
8:15
and that's one of the reasons
why that's labeled an abnormal

136
8:19
behavior or a mental health
problem.

137
8:22
The second general criterion is
"dysfunction."

138
8:26
If a set of behaviors prevents
the person from functioning in

139
8:30
daily life, then it might be
labeled as abnormal or might end

140
8:35
up being labeled as a mental
health problem.

141
8:39
Again, depression is a good
example.

142
8:41
People who are depressed often
become completely

143
8:44
non-functional.
They can't get up and go to

144
8:47
class;
they can't go to work;

145
8:49
they can't interact with their
friends;

146
8:51
they withdraw and become
totally isolated socially.

147
8:55
So, they might lose their job;
they might flunk out of school.

148
8:58
And this complete decline in
functioning is one of the major

149
9:02
reasons that we consider
depression one of the most

150
9:06
debilitating disorders.
And then finally,

151
9:10
"deviance," the behaviors or
feelings are highly unusual.

152
9:14
This is probably the most
controversial of the three

153
9:18
because it weighs,
it is so heavily influenced by

154
9:21
the social norms.
What's deviant in one culture

155
9:24
is not deviant in another
culture.

156
9:27
But if a set of behaviors is
completely unacceptable to a

157
9:31
culture, highly unusual,
they're more likely to end up

158
9:35
getting labeled as abnormal.
Okay.

159
9:40
So, how do we pull this all
together?

160
9:42
Well, these days the manual for
making diagnoses in clinical

161
9:47
psychology and psychiatry in the
United States is called the

162
9:51
Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual or the DSM,

163
9:55
and it's in its fourth revision.
It's been around since the,

164
10:01
I believe the '50s,
and the early editions in the

165
10:05
'50s and '60s were highly
subjective and based on Freudian

166
10:10
theory.
But since 1980 there's been

167
10:13
real effort to make the criteria
much more objective,

168
10:16
to make the set of behaviors or
observations that are required

169
10:22
to diagnose someone be things
that are observable,

170
10:26
that you can see in other
people that they can report on

171
10:31
reliably, and that one clinician
and another clinician will agree

172
10:36
upon.
So, the DSM gives lists

173
10:38
of symptoms with the required
symptoms for a diagnosis,

174
10:42
the number of symptoms that
have to be present,

175
10:45
and the notions of deviation,
dysfunction and distress are

176
10:49
built into these criteria.
And I'm going to give you a

177
10:52
couple of examples of these
criteria when we talk about the

178
10:56
specific types of mood disorder.
So as I said,

179
10:59
I'm going to use mood disorders
as kind of a case example here

180
11:03
of how we go about diagnosing
and understanding

181
11:06
psychopathology,
but I also just want to impart

182
11:09
some information because mood
disorders are one of the most

183
11:13
common problems that people
face.

184
11:16
As many as one in four women
will have an episode of serious

185
11:20
depression at some time in her
life,

186
11:22
and about 13% of men will have
an episode of serious depression

187
11:26
in their lives.
So, these are extremely common

188
11:29
kinds of problems that people
experience, particularly at your

189
11:34
age.
The college years are one of

190
11:37
the peak times of onset,
first onset,

191
11:40
of depression in particular.
And also, for bipolar disorder,

192
11:45
or manic-depression,
the late adolescent,

193
11:48
early 20s are the peak onset
times for these disorders as

194
11:53
well.
So, the mood disorders divide

195
11:55
into what's called unipolar
depression disorders,

196
11:59
which is depression only and
then bipolar disorders where the

197
12:03
person cycles between depression
and mania.

198
12:06
And here are the DSM
criteria for major depression,

199
12:09
one of the most severe forms of
depression.

200
12:12
And as I said,
the DSM sets up these

201
12:15
relatively observable criteria
and how many you have to have

202
12:19
and what absolutely has to be
present in order to get the

203
12:23
diagnosis.
So, the first criterion in the

204
12:26
DSM for major depression
is that the individual has to

205
12:31
either show sadness or a
diminished interest or pleasure

206
12:34
in their usual activities,
which is referred to as

207
12:39
anhedonia.
So, you have to have one or the

208
12:41
other of these to sort of pass
the first criterion.

209
12:44
So, you might say that you feel
sad and blue and just--or

210
12:49
actually say you feel depressed.
Some people feel those feelings

211
12:54
very strongly.
Other people don't really feel

212
12:57
so sad or blue,
but what they'll say is that

213
13:00
nothing interests them anymore.
It's like the emotion has been

214
13:03
sucked out of their life
altogether.

215
13:06
They don't have any fun doing
the activities they used to do

216
13:09
before.
They don't want to hang with

217
13:11
their friends.
They just--they don't care

218
13:13
about eating.
Just nothing feels right,

219
13:17
feels good, anymore.
And then the individual has to

220
13:21
have four of the--at least four
of the following symptoms in

221
13:25
addition to sadness or
anhedonia.

222
13:27
First, they can show
significant weight or appetite

223
13:31
change.
So, you may completely lose

224
13:34
your interest in eating and lose
a lot of weight,

225
13:36
or some people go on eating
binges.

226
13:39
I had a very good friend who
was depressed for about a year,

227
13:41
and she gained fifty pounds
because she would just eat.

228
13:44
She would binge eat,
especially at night.

229
13:48
There are sleep
disturbances--insomnia,

230
13:50
which is having trouble
sleeping, or hypersomnia,

231
13:54
which is sleeping all the time.
There's a particular form of

232
13:58
insomnia that's especially
likely in depression where you

233
14:02
can go to sleep at night,
but then you wake up at about

234
14:05
three or four in the morning
every night and you can't go

235
14:08
back to sleep at all.
You're just up for the rest of

236
14:12
the night.
But other people want to sleep

237
14:14
all day long,
and in the clip I'm going to

238
14:16
show you in just a minute the
woman talks about sleeping

239
14:19
twenty,
twenty-two hours a day,

240
14:21
getting up, eating a little
bit, and then going back to bed

241
14:25
because she was exhausted still.
The third criterion is

242
14:29
psychomotor retardation or
agitation.

243
14:32
The retardation is much more
common, and what this means is

244
14:35
that sort of everything about
the person's movement is slowed

245
14:39
down.
They'll walk more slowly.

246
14:43
Their reaction times will be
slowed down.

247
14:46
And because they're so much
more slow moving,

248
14:49
depressed people are often more
prone to accidents.

249
14:53
They just can't react as
quickly as they need to when

250
14:56
they're driving or when they're
crossing the road and a car is

251
14:59
coming at them suddenly.
So, they get into more

252
15:02
accidents.
And their speech may be slowed

253
15:06
down.
They may talk very,

254
15:08
very slowly and it's as though
it just takes a tremendous

255
15:13
amount of energy to get even a
common sentence out.

256
15:19
A much more,
much smaller number of people

257
15:22
get agitated instead of slow
down.

258
15:24
They may be hyper and just feel
like they can't sit still and

259
15:29
such, but the agitation is much
more rare than the retardation.

260
15:34
People feel really tired,
fatigued and like they have

261
15:38
absolutely no energy.
They can't get up and can't get

262
15:41
moving.
As I said, they may want to

263
15:44
just sleep all of the time.
Number five is feelings of

264
15:48
worthlessness or excessive
guilt.

265
15:50
They may feel as though
everything is their fault,

266
15:53
and the guilt feelings or sense
of worthlessness can even get

267
15:57
psychotic.
They can lose touch with

268
16:00
reality.
When a person loses touch with

269
16:02
reality when they're depressed,
it typically has really

270
16:05
depressing themes.
They may believe that they are

271
16:08
Satan and that they have to
commit suicide because they're

272
16:13
inflicting evil on the world.
They may believe as though

273
16:18
random events are their fault,
you know, that a flood that

274
16:23
just happened somehow they
caused.

275
16:26
So, the feelings of
worthlessness and guilt can get

276
16:29
completely out of touch with
reality, psychotic.

277
16:33
More commonly,
they're just unrealistic.

278
16:35
They're negative self-esteem,
just being down on yourself,

279
16:41
feeling stupid and worthless
and ugly and bad.

280
16:46
Number six is diminished
ability to concentrate or

281
16:49
indecisiveness.
When you are depressed it's

282
16:53
really hard to pay attention.
You'll read a passage over and

283
16:57
over again and you just can't
process it at all.

284
17:00
You can't concentrate on a
lecture so going to class is

285
17:04
just useless.
You have to make a decision

286
17:07
about what a paper topic is,
and it just seems like the most

287
17:11
monumental thing on earth.
You just can't decide anything,

288
17:14
you can't think anything;
your thoughts are completely

289
17:18
clouded and overwhelmed.
And then suicidal ideation or

290
17:23
behavior;
it means you think about

291
17:24
committing suicide,
you think about dying.

292
17:26
And a subset of people actually
take action to try to hurt

293
17:30
themselves or kill themselves.
Now, it should be said that

294
17:34
suicidal thoughts and behavior
don't only happen in depression.

295
17:38
They actually happen in all
types of psychopathology,

296
17:42
but they're particularly common
in depression.

297
17:46
So, you have to have at least
one--four of those symptoms plus

298
17:50
sadness or anhedonia,
and these symptoms--it can't

299
17:53
just be a bad day that you're
having.

300
17:56
These symptoms have to be
present persistently for at

301
17:59
least two weeks to get the
diagnosis.

302
18:02
Now, truth be told,
most episodes of major

303
18:04
depression actually last a lot
longer than two weeks.

304
18:07
In fact, the average length of
an episode, if it's not treated,

305
18:11
is at least six months.
So, people stay this miserable

306
18:16
for a very long period of time,
but the minimum criterion in

307
18:20
the DSM is at least two
weeks.

308
18:23
So, what I want to do is to
just show you a short clip of a

309
18:28
woman who has had a lot of
episodes of depression.

310
18:31
Fortunately,
at the moment she's not in an

311
18:34
episode.
But she can speak very

312
18:37
articulately about what it's
like to be in the midst of an

313
18:41
episode and some of the
significant symptoms that she

314
18:45
had.
Okay.

315
18:46
There are couple of things she
talks about that I just want to

316
18:48
comment on.
One is this differentiation

317
18:50
between everyday sad mood and
the kind of depressions we all

318
18:55
experience and the kind of
debilitating,

319
18:58
overwhelming depression that
she experiences.

320
19:01
And it is true that there is
this continuum from getting

321
19:05
bummed out because you didn't do
well on a test or because you

322
19:08
broke up with a boyfriend or
girlfriend or something like

323
19:12
this and being completely not
functional,

324
19:15
vegetative, the way that this
woman becomes whenever she gets

325
19:19
depressed.
And it would be nice if we were

326
19:22
really sure where the cutoff was
between those normal everyday

327
19:26
depressions and what's really a
disorder.

328
19:30
But the reality is we don't
really have real clear

329
19:33
demarcation lines.
There are a lot of people who

330
19:37
have more moderate forms of
depression than Tara here talks

331
19:41
about but who still would
qualify for a diagnosis and are

332
19:45
still suffering and impaired by
their symptoms.

333
19:49
So, I don't want you to get the
sense that if you don't have the

334
19:53
kind of horrible version on the
extreme end of the continuum of

335
19:57
depression that Tara has,
then there's nothing wrong with

336
20:00
you, because that's not the
case.

337
20:02
People who are really slowed,
whom their functioning is

338
20:07
interfered with--they're just
really unhappy with life--have

339
20:12
problems that can be helped and
do need attention.

340
20:17
And it is the case that much
more moderate forms of

341
20:20
depression can morph into more
serious forms if they're left

342
20:24
untreated.
So, there is this continuum.

343
20:26
The other things I wanted to
comment on that she talks about

344
20:30
early on in this piece is the
fact that she hauls herself up

345
20:34
and goes through her day,
even when she's feeling really,

346
20:37
really depressed.
And there is this

347
20:39
characteristic of a lot of
depressed people that I call the

348
20:43
"walking wounded."
They just haul themselves

349
20:46
through the day trying to act
normal, trying not to let

350
20:49
anybody know that there's
anything wrong with them,

351
20:53
trying to keep up with their
schoolwork or their employment.

352
20:58
But they're miserable and
they're not functioning at the

353
21:01
level that they're capable of
and such.

354
21:03
And that's something that's
very, very common,

355
21:06
and it's in part because people
don't feel as though they should

356
21:10
have to get treatment or they're
ashamed of getting treatment or

357
21:14
seeking help for depression.
And so, they just keep going on

358
21:18
and going on,
sometimes for years,

359
21:20
in a very sorry state
before--sometimes they

360
21:23
just--they end up actually
falling apart to the point where

361
21:27
they have to get help.
Okay.

362
21:31
The other category of mood
disorders that I mentioned is

363
21:35
bipolar disorders.
And as I said,

364
21:38
bipolar disorder involves
symptoms or periods of

365
21:41
depression but then also
distinct periods of the opposite

366
21:46
of depression,
which we call "mania."

367
21:48
So, the person cycles back and
forth between debilitating

368
21:53
depressions and manic episodes.
So, let me describe manic

369
21:57
episodes to you now.
So, the first criterion is that

370
22:00
instead of feeling down,
blue or depressed the person

371
22:04
has an abnormally and
persistently elevated expansive

372
22:07
or irritable mood that isn't
just,

373
22:10
again, a good day because you
won a prize or got an "A," but

374
22:15
rather, it's this unusually
positive,

375
22:18
expansive mood for at least one
week persistently.

376
22:24
And then the person has to have
three or more of the following

377
22:27
symptoms.
First, inflated self-esteem or

378
22:30
grandiosity.
The individual may feel as

379
22:33
though they are the smartest,
the most creative,

380
22:37
insightful,
powerful person on earth,

381
22:39
and they are perfectly happy to
tell you this.

382
22:42
So, there is no problem with
self-esteem, thank you very

383
22:46
much.
"If you can't keep up with me

384
22:48
it's your fault."
There's a decreased need for

385
22:51
sleep;
they may only sleep a couple of

386
22:53
hours a night and get up raring
to go.

387
22:56
They tend to be more talkative
than usual, and there's a really

388
22:59
pressure to their talk.
They'll talk really pressured,

389
23:02
and they'll talk really,
really fast.

390
23:04
And one of the reasons they're
talking really,

391
23:05
really fast is they have this
flight of ideas.

392
23:07
The thoughts are just racing
through their mind,

393
23:09
and they can't talk fast enough
to get them out.

394
23:11
And if you can't follow them,
that--well, that's because

395
23:13
you're not smart enough to
follow them.

396
23:14
But they've just got too many
good ideas and they've got to

397
23:18
get them out.
They're highly distractible.

398
23:21
And then there is this increase
in this--what the DSM

399
23:25
calls this "goal-directed
activity."

400
23:28
Out of their grandiosity will
come these grand schemes

401
23:32
for--often for making a lot of
money and they'll pursue these

402
23:36
with great vigor no matter how
totally irrational they are.

403
23:40
So, it's not at all uncommon
for them to cash out all the

404
23:43
family bank accounts,
to sell the house,

405
23:46
to sell the car,
to sell the kids so that they

406
23:49
can finance this great scheme
for making a zillion dollars on

407
23:53
the Internet tomorrow.
Right?

408
23:55
Okay.
And they'll pursue this with

409
23:58
tremendous vigor.
They'll also get involved in

410
24:01
all kinds of,
what the DSM discreetly

411
24:04
calls "pleasurable but dangerous
activities."

412
24:07
There's a lot of sexual
promiscuity, a lot of drug

413
24:11
abuse, a lot of,
as I said,

414
24:14
getting--going and gambling,
believing that you're on a hot

415
24:17
streak, there's nothing can stop
you.

416
24:19
You know, you're just so
brilliant and you've got this

417
24:22
scheme, you've got the plan.
You're going to make it.

418
24:24
Okay?
So, the individual has three of

419
24:28
more of these kinds of symptoms
plus this elevated,

420
24:32
expansive and often quite
irritable mood.

421
24:34
It's not just that they're
happy, you know,

422
24:37
and sort of upbeat.
It's just that they're just

423
24:40
impatient and irritable and
trigger-fire.

424
24:43
And sometimes they can become
violent because they're

425
24:46
just--they're so incredibly
agitated and irritable.

426
24:50
So, let me show you a couple of
clips.

427
24:53
I have one really short one.
It's not a real high quality

428
24:56
clip, but it's a very,
very nice example of an older

429
24:58
woman who is in the midst of a
manic episode.

430
25:01
And it shows what this kind of
agitation and flight of ideas

431
25:07
and racing thoughts can look
like.

432
25:10
And then the other one is--I'll
introduce whenever you--we do

433
25:16
it.
So while she was at the

434
25:18
hairdresser's it's a nice
example of how she was just

435
25:22
pressured to speak.
Nobody was telling her that she

436
25:25
had to say all of these things.
They were just standing there

437
25:28
with a camera and she was going
on and on and on about these

438
25:31
things.
And as you could see she was

439
25:33
getting more and more agitated
and more and more irritated as

440
25:36
she was retelling her story.
And then what?

441
25:39
In the last little bit there
you saw her flip from her mania

442
25:44
into a more depressed state.
And this poor lady,

443
25:47
unfortunately,
is having a hard time finding a

444
25:51
stable point.
He talked about lithium there,

445
25:54
and I'll talk about it in a
little bit--about the use of

446
25:56
lithium as a drug to try to
stabilize these mood swings.

447
25:59
But at this point in this
video, it's not working for this

448
26:03
lady.
And so, she's flipping back and

449
26:06
forth, but they're having a hard
time finding that middle ground.

450
26:10
So, I want to show you another
clip--it's a little bit

451
26:13
longer--of a man who has bipolar
disorder.

452
26:16
He is not currently in an
episode of either depression or

453
26:21
mania, but again,
he can talk about some of the

454
26:25
things he got himself into and
how it manifested in his

455
26:30
behavior.
Okay.

456
26:33
Just a couple of things that
Bernie talks about that I want

457
26:36
to comment on.
One is that just as in

458
26:38
depression, mania has--runs
along a continuum.

459
26:42
So, it can be relatively mild
all the way to extremely severe

460
26:48
and even psychotic.
So, when a person with mania

461
26:53
loses touch with reality,
instead of having beliefs that

462
26:57
they are Satan or they've done
some horrible thing,

463
27:01
they'll believe that they are
some supernatural being.

464
27:06
They may believe that they are
the Messiah or that they are

465
27:09
Albert Einstein,
you know, come back to life,

466
27:12
or that they have supernatural
powers or something of this

467
27:16
sort,
so that their false beliefs,

468
27:19
their delusions and their
hallucinations,

469
27:21
the things that they see and
hear that aren't really there

470
27:26
tend to be very grandiose in
their themes.

471
27:29
Bernie's mania is not on the
far end of the continuum by any

472
27:33
stretch, but you can see it
still gets him into trouble.

473
27:36
Now, there are people who
have--who cycle between fairly

474
27:40
low levels of mania and fairly
low levels of depression,

475
27:44
back and forth.
And there's been some argument

476
27:47
that people who are kind of
chronically, mildly

477
27:50
manic--especially if they're
really smart or they have a

478
27:54
special talent – can make it
work for them.

479
27:57
And there is a wonderful book
by Kay Jamison,

480
28:02
who is a professor at Johns
Hopkins where she

481
28:06
chronicles--She does sort of
historical biographies on a

482
28:11
number of well-known authors and
poets and musicians,

483
28:17
Robert Schumann and a number of
politicians, Winston Churchill

484
28:22
and such, arguing that they
actually had mild forms of

485
28:26
bipolar disorder and that they
were able to sort of channel the

486
28:31
manic episodes through
extraordinary talent or

487
28:34
intelligence in ways that made
it work for them.

488
28:39
There are also a number of
arguments that very,

489
28:42
very successful CEOs sometimes
are people who are chronically

490
28:47
slightly manic.
They can go on a couple of

491
28:50
hours a night of sleep;
they're obviously really quite

492
28:53
grandiose and self-confident,
and that they can maintain this

493
28:57
kind of moderate level of mania,
keep it under control and

494
29:01
channel it in ways that work for
them.

495
29:03
So, if you're interested in
that book, send me an email and

496
29:07
I'm happy to send you the
citation for it.

497
29:10
But for the most part,
mania can get people into

498
29:14
tremendous trouble.
They can, as I said,

499
29:17
get involved in sexual
promiscuity that puts them at

500
29:21
risk for sexually transmitted
diseases.

501
29:24
They can get involved in drug
activity.

502
29:25
They can get themselves
arrested.

503
29:28
They can certainly send
themselves and their family into

504
29:30
bankruptcy.
And these kinds of negative

505
29:33
consequences of the mania often
are what motivates the person to

506
29:37
get help because the mania
itself can be rather pleasurable

507
29:41
to have.
Also, what motivates them to

508
29:44
get help is the plunge into
depression, the knowledge that

509
29:48
they will,
at some point,

510
29:50
come out of the mania and go
into a debilitating depression.

511
29:54
Bipolar disorder is much less
common than depression.

512
29:57
I said that about 22% of women
and about 13% of men will have

513
30:01
an episode of serious depression
at some time in their lives.

514
30:05
Bipolar disorder occurs in only
about 1% of the population,

515
30:10
and it's equally prevalent in
women and men.

516
30:13
So, it's a really quite
different disorder in many ways

517
30:18
from depression alone.
I want to give you some other

518
30:22
statistics about depression per
se, and this only applies to

519
30:25
depression.
There are quite large age

520
30:29
differences in the prevalence of
depression.

521
30:33
These are data from a
nationwide study of people

522
30:36
between the ages of fifteen and
fifty-five, and these are the

523
30:41
percentages of people in this
study.

524
30:43
And there were several thousand
people in the study.

525
30:46
These are not people who have
sought treatment for depression

526
30:50
but just a random community
sample.

527
30:52
And this is the percentage
who've had an episode of major

528
30:55
depression in the past month.
And as you can see,

529
30:58
the fifteen to twenty-four age
range has the highest rates,

530
31:03
and then they go down somewhat,
although the thirty-five to

531
31:07
forty-four is fairly high as
well with age.

532
31:10
You might be surprised to learn
that the rates of major

533
31:13
depression in the elderly are
actually quite low by most

534
31:17
national statistics.
And that's true up to about age

535
31:22
eighty or eighty-five.
And the arguments for why this

536
31:27
is the case are very
interesting.

537
31:30
There are some people who argue
that as you get older you get

538
31:34
wiser, and so that's why we see
lower rates of depression in

539
31:38
older age.
There are other people who

540
31:41
argue that current
generation--younger generations

541
31:44
now;
your generation and the one

542
31:46
above you--are more prone to
depression and will be for the

543
31:50
rest of your life compared to
your grandparents,

544
31:53
because of historical changes
in the kinds of social support

545
31:58
and family networks available
and a number of other historical

546
32:02
cultural changes.
The other sort of side of the

547
32:06
argument is that because
depression is known to impact

548
32:10
negatively your physical health
– depression is associated

549
32:14
with higher rates of
cardio-vascular disease,

550
32:18
stroke, immune system diseases,
a whole host of diseases that

551
32:21
people die from--that people who
have a lifelong history of

552
32:24
depression are actually more
likely to die at an earlier age,

553
32:28
and that's why we see
relatively low rates in older

554
32:31
age people.
We don't know yet which of

555
32:33
these explanations is true.
It may be that they're all true

556
32:36
to some extent.
There are also gender

557
32:39
differences in depression.
These are data from a

558
32:44
compilation of hundreds of
studies of children and

559
32:48
adolescents,
looking at not full-blown

560
32:51
depression but levels of
depression on self-report

561
32:55
questionnaires.
Probably most of you have

562
32:57
filled out these questionnaires,
like the Beck Depression

563
33:00
Inventory that ask you how
you've been feeling in the last

564
33:04
month.
And there's a kiddy version of

565
33:06
this, and these are data from
that, from several thousand

566
33:09
children.
And as you can see here,

567
33:11
prior to the age of about
thirteen, boys and girls have

568
33:15
relatively similar levels of
depression.

569
33:17
But beginning around the
pubertal years,

570
33:20
girls' rates of depression go
up quite dramatically and boys'

571
33:25
rates stay the same or go down.
And by the time they're

572
33:29
eighteen or twenty you get
almost a two-to-one ratio of

573
33:32
depressed girls to depressed
boys.

574
33:34
And then this is true for the
rest of the adult age span.

575
33:38
There are lots of hypotheses
about this, why it's true.

576
33:42
There are biological hypotheses
that have to do with hormones.

577
33:46
There are sociological
hypotheses that have to do with

578
33:49
the kinds of stress,
and particularly abuse,

579
33:52
in girls' lives relative to
boys'.

580
33:55
We don't know exactly why.
It's probably a lot of these

581
33:59
things coming together that make
this huge two-to-one ratio true.

582
34:04
So, let's talk a little bit
about the major theories and

583
34:07
treatments for the mood
disorders.

584
34:10
There are biological theories
and treatments,

585
34:12
what are known as cognitive
behavioral theories and

586
34:14
treatments and then
interpersonal theories and

587
34:17
treatments.
And I'll walk you through

588
34:19
examples of each of these.
So, first, genetics.

589
34:24
It's pretty clear that genetics
are involved in the mood

590
34:27
disorders, especially bipolar
disorder.

591
34:30
There is very strong evidence
in bipolar disorder,

592
34:33
and there are a number of
ways--Have you talked about how

593
34:37
you do genetic studies?
Okay.

594
34:39
So, you guys know about twin
studies for example and family

595
34:44
history studies.
So, this is actually a

596
34:47
compilation of a group of
studies.

597
34:49
And here you've got some of
them – twin studies--compared.

598
34:54
So, in monozygotic twins,
if your identical twin has

599
34:58
bipolar disorder,
you have over a 60% chance of

600
35:01
having the disorder yourself.
In contrast,

601
35:05
if it's your--if you're just a
fraternal twin of a person with

602
35:09
bipolar disorder,
you only have about a 12%

603
35:12
chance of having the disorder.
So, that massive difference

604
35:16
there is very strong evidence
that there's a genetic component

605
35:19
to the transmission of the
disorder.

606
35:22
Similarly, the more distant you
get in terms of your biological

607
35:27
relation to a person with
bipolar disorder,

608
35:31
the lower your rate or your
risk of the disorder is.

609
35:35
So, the second degree relatives
of a person with bipolar

610
35:40
disorder only have about 2%
chance of getting the disorder.

611
35:44
And that's barely above what's
in the general population,

612
35:48
which is about a 1% chance of
getting the disorder.

613
35:52
So, it's very clear that
bipolar disorder has a genetic

614
35:55
component to it.
With depression alone,

615
35:58
major depression,
there are probably versions of

616
36:02
the disorder that have a
stronger genetic component to

617
36:06
them than others.
And in particular,

618
36:09
folks who have what's called
"early onset depression," where

619
36:14
their first episodes come on in
childhood or very early

620
36:18
adolescence,
seem to have a form of

621
36:21
depression that has a stronger
genetic component to it.

622
36:25
Whereas, people who have
depression that is clearly

623
36:29
triggered by a major life event
like a trauma or a loss--those

624
36:33
types of depression are less
clearly linked strongly to

625
36:37
genetic factors.
There are also a number of

626
36:41
neurotransmitters that have been
implicated in the mood

627
36:44
disorders.
And the class of

628
36:46
neurotransmitters that's been
researched most often is what's

629
36:50
called the monoamines.
I'm sure you've heard about the

630
36:54
link between serotonin and
depression, but there are two

631
36:57
other monoamines,
norepinephrine and dopamine,

632
37:00
that have also been linked to
both of the mood disorders,

633
37:04
both bipolar disorder and
depression.

634
37:09
And it used to be thought that
it was just that in people with

635
37:12
depression they didn't have
enough of these

636
37:15
neurotransmitters,
enough serotonin,

637
37:17
in particular,
in the system,

638
37:20
in the brain,
in order to function normally.

639
37:24
But now the theories on what
the role of neurotransmitters is

640
37:29
have a lot more to do with the
receptors for these

641
37:33
neurotransmitters and their
functioning.

642
37:36
And the notion is that the
receptors for neurotransmitters

643
37:40
like serotonin don't function
efficiently.

644
37:43
So, even if there's enough of
the chemicals in the synapses in

645
37:48
the brain, the neurons can't
make use of them because the

646
37:52
receptors aren't functioning
appropriately.

647
37:56
And so what the drugs that help
relieve depression do is to

648
38:01
improve the functioning of these
neurotransmitters.

649
38:05
There's a very interesting line
of work that's going on right

650
38:09
now looking at the intersection
of genetic predisposition

651
38:13
neurotransmitter functioning and
stress.

652
38:16
And we have one of the world's
experts on this kind of work now

653
38:20
here at Yale,
Julia Kim-Cohen,

654
38:22
who just joined us in the last
year.

655
38:25
But there are several recent
studies.

656
38:27
There's another person in
psychiatry, Joan Kaufman,

657
38:30
who's done some of this work.
But there are several recent

658
38:33
studies that find that certain
variations or polymorphisms on

659
38:37
the serotonin transporter gene
predict who will become

660
38:41
depressed in the face of stress.
So, a classic study was done by

661
38:46
Avshalom Caspi and colleagues,
and they found that people who

662
38:51
have one or two of what's called
the short allele on the

663
38:55
serotonin transporter gene--so
this is a particular variation

664
39:00
on the serotonin transporter
gene--if they had one or two of

665
39:04
these short alleles and they
were confronted with stress,

666
39:09
they were more likely to
develop depression.

667
39:17
But it's important to sort of
dissect this.

668
39:21
So people who had--it didn't
really matter which of these

669
39:25
genes you had.
If you were never confronted

670
39:28
with major kinds of stress,
like maltreatment,

671
39:32
if you weren't confronted with
stress,

672
39:35
you were no more likely to have
depression regardless of what

673
39:40
kind of serotonin gene you had.
But if you had either one short

674
39:46
allele or two short alleles and
you were confronted with

675
39:50
maltreatment as a child,
you had a much greater

676
39:53
probability of becoming
depressed at some time in your

677
39:56
life.
And this has been replicated

678
39:59
with other samples,
with other forms of major

679
40:02
trauma.
And basically the story is,

680
40:05
it takes the intersection of a
genetic predisposition and major

681
40:10
stress to create full-blown
depression in some people.

682
40:15
Now, that may not be true for
all genetic predispositions or

683
40:18
all forms of depression,
but this serotonin finding has

684
40:21
actually been replicated now in
at least four different studies.

685
40:26
So, it seems to be a pretty
reliable effect.

686
40:30
So again, genes do not
determine the disorder,

687
40:34
but the intersection of genes
and stress seems to be a major

688
40:40
risk factor for the disorder.
There are a number of brain

689
40:44
areas that seem to be involved
in the mood disorders where

690
40:48
there is just dysregulation or
dysfunction.

691
40:52
The prefrontal cortex,
as you probably have studied,

692
40:55
is an area of the brain that's
very involved in higher order

693
41:00
complex thinking and problem
solving and in goal-directed

694
41:04
behavior.
In people with depression,

695
41:07
there's lowered activity in the
prefrontal cortex,

696
41:10
suggesting that--which may play
a role in the difficulties in

697
41:16
concentration,
in goal-directed behavior,

698
41:20
in planning and problem solving
and in regulating emotion.

699
41:26
The amygdala is an area of the
brain that is involved in the

700
41:29
processing of emotional
information.

701
41:31
And people with mood disorders
show overactive amygdala

702
41:37
responses to emotional
information.

703
41:41
This is true in both bipolar
and in depression.

704
41:47
The hippocampus is an area of
the brain that's very involved

705
41:51
in memory and in concentration.
And in people with chronic

706
41:55
depression, you often see
shrinkage in the hippocampus,

707
41:59
and this may be related to
their problems in concentration

708
42:03
and attention.
And then finally,

709
42:05
the anterior cingulate is an
area of the brain that's

710
42:08
involved in a lot of different
activities,

711
42:10
but pertinent to the mood
disorders, particularly in

712
42:14
responses to distress--to stress
and in sort of the choice of

713
42:19
behaviors.
And it may be that

714
42:21
dysregulation of the anterior
cingulate may be involved in the

715
42:25
person's difficulty in
responding appropriately to

716
42:28
stress,
in choosing good coping

717
42:30
behaviors and changing their
behaviors whenever their

718
42:34
behaviors aren't working well.

719
42:36


720
42:40
So, from the biological
theories come a number of

721
42:43
different drugs to treat the
mood disorders.

722
42:45
Two of the older classes are
called the monoamine oxidase

723
42:49
inhibitors and the tricyclic
antidepressants.

724
42:51
The tricyclics are still used
these days to some extent.

725
42:55
They're relatively effective.
About 60% of people respond

726
42:59
well to the tricyclics,
but they have a lot of side

727
43:02
effects, and they can be fatal
in overdose.

728
43:05
And so there was a--has been
always a search for other

729
43:09
alternatives to them.
The drugs that have really

730
43:13
taken over the market are the
selective serotonin re-uptake

731
43:16
inhibitors or SSRIs.
This is Paxil,

732
43:19
Prozac and the like.
They were introduced in

733
43:22
1987--Prozac was--in the U.S.
market and truly took over the

734
43:26
market in the treatment of
depression and anxiety and a

735
43:29
number of other disorders.
Now, they're not that much more

736
43:33
effective than the sort of old
style antidepressants,

737
43:36
but they have fewer side
effects and they tend to be

738
43:38
easier for people to tolerate.
More recently,

739
43:41
there are selective
serotonin/norepinephrine

740
43:44
re-uptake inhibitors.
These drugs,

741
43:47
by the way, what these drugs
supposedly do is to prevent the

742
43:52
re-uptake of serotonin or
serotonin and norepinephrine

743
43:56
back into the sending neuron.
So, it creates more of the

744
44:01
neurotransmitter there in the
synapse.

745
44:04
And these are reasonably
effective drugs,

746
44:06
although, again,
there's a substantial number of

747
44:08
people who don't respond to
them, especially immediately.

748
44:11
And they'll often have to cycle
through a number of drugs before

749
44:15
they find one that works.
Lithium is the drug of choice

750
44:19
for the treatment of bipolar
disorder.

751
44:21
It seems to stabilize the mood
swings by stabilizing the number

752
44:26
of different neurotransmitter
systems.

753
44:28
But the lithium is problematic
because there are tremendous

754
44:34
side effects.
It's also dangerous for women

755
44:37
to take while they're pregnant
in terms of fetal development.

756
44:40
So, it's a very tough drug to
stay on.

757
44:44
There are lots of
gastrointestinal side effects

758
44:47
and such, and people are often
on lithium and the

759
44:50
antidepressants because lithium
often only affects the manic

760
44:54
episodes but it doesn't really
relieve the depression.

761
44:58
And then finally anti-psychotic
medications, that is those help

762
45:02
people who've lost touch with
reality,

763
45:05
are sometimes used to treat the
mood disorders whenever the

764
45:10
person has lost touch with
reality.

765
45:13
I'm going to go through and
talk about some of the

766
45:18
psychosocial treatments because
I want to get to them as well.

767
45:23
The cognitive behavioral
therapies are based on Aaron

768
45:28
Beck's Negative Cognitive Theory
of Depression.

769
45:33
Aaron Beck is a psychiatrist at
the University of Pennsylvania

770
45:36
who really founded this whole
line of work.

771
45:39
And according to Beck,
this--now, this applies to

772
45:42
depression alone.
It doesn't really apply to

773
45:44
bipolar disorder.
People who are depressed have a

774
45:46
negative view of the self,
of the future and of the world,

775
45:49
and he calls this the "negative
cognitive triad."

776
45:51
And this negative cognitive
triad is fed by specific

777
45:56
cognitive deficits or biases.
So, depressed people show a lot

778
46:00
of distortions in thinking.
"All-or-nothing thinking" is

779
46:04
thinking that things are either
all good or all bad.

780
46:07
They can't sort of see the gray
areas in between.

781
46:11
There's "emotional reasoning,"
and an example of that is just

782
46:15
if I feel like a loser I must be
a loser.

783
46:18
Of if I feel stupid,
I must be stupid.

784
46:21
And then "personalization,"
that is the self-blame that you

785
46:25
often see in depressed people.
And these kinds of distortions

786
46:29
in thinking, these distorted
ways of interpreting situations,

787
46:32
feed a kind of general negative
view of the self and

788
46:36
hopelessness about the future.
People who are depressed also

789
46:40
make attributions for negative
events that are internal,

790
46:43
that is, they blame
themselves--that are stable.

791
46:46
They see bad things as lasting
forever and that are global.

792
46:50
They see bad events as
affecting many areas of their

793
46:54
life, which, again,
feeds their depression and

794
46:57
their general assumption that
life is terrible.

795
47:01
And evidence that these--for
these cognitive theories,

796
47:04
that these negative cognitive
styles predict depression--one

797
47:07
of the best studies predicting
this was a study that was

798
47:10
jointly done at Temple
University and the University of

799
47:13
Wisconsin where they identified
first year college students with

800
47:17
a negative cognitive or
attributional style.

801
47:20
But these were people who had
never experienced an episode of

802
47:23
depression yet.
They then tracked them for the

803
47:25
next two years,
and the bars here--the red bars

804
47:28
are the percent of those with a
negative cognitive style who

805
47:31
developed an episode of major
depression in that two and a

806
47:35
half years versus the percent of
those without a negative

807
47:38
cognitive style.
And as you can see,

808
47:41
there's quite a substantial
difference between the two.

809
47:43
So prospectively,
these characteristics seem to

810
47:47
predict your risk for
depression.

811
47:51
In turn, there is a cognitive
behavioral therapy that's based

812
47:55
on Beck's theory.
And the major steps in this

813
47:58
involve identifying the themes
in a person's negative thoughts

814
48:02
and triggers for them and in
helping the person challenge

815
48:05
those thoughts by asking them
what the evidence is for their

816
48:09
interpretations,
whether there are other ways of

817
48:12
looking at the situation,
how they could cope with the

818
48:15
situation if a bad thing really
did happen.

819
48:18
So, the therapist helps the
client recognize negative

820
48:22
beliefs or assumptions and then
challenges the truth value of

821
48:26
these,
and then change aspects of the

822
48:29
environment that are related to
depressive symptoms.

823
48:32
So, they challenge your
rational thinking,

824
48:33
but they also recognize that
there are really bad things that

825
48:36
sometimes are going on the life
of a person who is depressed,

826
48:40
and they help them engage in
more active problem solving to

827
48:43
change those environments.
They also teach the person ways

828
48:48
to manage their mood so that
they don't tumble down into

829
48:52
depression.
And these cognitive behavioral

830
48:56
therapies have been shown to be
extremely effective and as

831
49:01
effective in some ways as the
drug treatments.

832
49:05
So, this is a recent study in
which they had 240 patients with

833
49:09
major depressive disorder.
They gave them four months of

834
49:13
acute treatment with either
cognitive behavioral therapy or

835
49:17
Paxil, which is an SSRI.
And in eight weeks here--they

836
49:20
also had a placebo control group
where they just got a pill,

837
49:23
but it was a sugar pill.
At eight weeks,

838
49:26
the Paxil group,
which is in red,

839
49:28
and the CBT group,
which is in yellow,

840
49:31
were relatively even,
although the Paxil group had a

841
49:33
little bit of an edge over the
CBT group.

842
49:35
But by sixteen weeks the Paxil
and CBT group were absolutely

843
49:40
even in terms of the percent of
people who were no longer

844
49:44
depressed.
So, both of them resulted in

845
49:47
about 60% of people not being
depressed.

846
49:49
And then one of the things
that's been found over and over

847
49:52
again with cognitive behavioral
therapy is that it not only

848
49:55
helps people get out of a
current episode of depression,

849
49:58
it helps to prevent future
episodes of depression because

850
50:02
it teaches the person new coping
skills for dealing with new

851
50:06
stressors that arise.
So, in this same study they

852
50:09
followed the patients for an
additional twelve months.

853
50:12
And of the Paxil group,
half were left on full-dose

854
50:15
medications to see if you could
prevent depression by just

855
50:18
keeping people on the meds,
and half of the Paxil group

856
50:22
were withdrawn to a placebo.
And let's look at the placebo

857
50:26
group first here.
This is the sad news about

858
50:30
depression.
If you just take drugs to get

859
50:32
out of a current episode and you
go off of the drugs without

860
50:35
having any kind of
psychotherapy,

861
50:37
your rate of relapse tends to
be very high.

862
50:40
So, in this group of 240,
almost 80% relapsed in the

863
50:45
first year after going off of
the active medication.

864
50:49
Again, these were people who
did not get any cognitive

865
50:52
behavioral therapy.
Of those people who stayed on

866
50:56
Paxil alone, about 50% relapsed.
But of those people who got

867
51:00
cognitive behavioral therapy,
only about 35% relapsed.

868
51:04
And this kind of finding has
been replicated over and over

869
51:08
again, namely that CBT can
reduce the rate of relapse in

870
51:13
depression quite dramatically.
I want to give you a flavor for

871
51:18
what CBT looks like,
and I've got a short clip of a

872
51:22
therapist who is actually,
interestingly,

873
51:25
the daughter of Aaron Beck and
his heir in terms of the

874
51:29
practice and development of
cognitive behavioral therapy.

875
51:34
And she's demonstrating CBT.
This is actually a role play,

876
51:39
but it's a pretty realistic
role play, of how she goes after

877
51:43
and helps to challenge a
gentleman's negative cognitions

878
51:47
about himself.
This is a guy in the role who's

879
51:51
recently lost his job and is
really depressed over his job

880
51:57
loss.
Okay.

881
51:58
I'm going to stop there because
we're running out of time.

882
52:00
But I just want to comment on a
couple of things that she's

883
52:02
doing.
So, you see that she's having

884
52:04
him generate his own challenges
to his negative thoughts and

885
52:08
write them down.
And the whole--one of the major

886
52:12
premises in CBT is it's not just
what goes on in the therapy

887
52:16
session that is effective.
In fact, that's a minor part of

888
52:20
it, but what the person
practices in the time between

889
52:23
therapy sessions.
And so, what she's doing is

890
52:26
helping him come up with a
series of phrases he can say to

891
52:29
himself when he feels
discouraged and plunging down.

892
52:33
She's also helping him do
what's called "anticipatory

893
52:36
coping," anticipating those
situations that are going to

894
52:39
trigger negative feelings and
negative thoughts and coming up

895
52:42
with ways of combating them in
the moment that he can enact at

896
52:46
the time.
Cognitive behavioral therapy is

897
52:48
very structured,
it's very focused and it's

898
52:51
designed to be relatively
short-term.

899
52:53
The one other major kind of
psychotherapy for depression is

900
52:57
interpersonal therapy.
It's based on the theory that

901
53:00
negative views of the self and
expectations about the self and

902
53:04
relationships are based on
upbringings that really fostered

903
53:08
these kinds of negative
self-views.

904
53:10
And so, what you need to do is
to help clients understand their

905
53:14
negative self-views and how
they're rooted in their past

906
53:18
relationships.
Interpersonal therapy is less

907
53:21
structured than cognitive
behavioral therapy,

908
53:24
and it's more focused on the
past.

909
53:27
CBT is very focused on the
present and dealing with the

910
53:30
current situation that you're
facing and combating that and

911
53:33
developing coping styles for
that.

912
53:36
There are a few studies
comparing interpersonal therapy

913
53:40
with CBT, but much less research
has been done on IPT than CBT.

914
53:45
But it is a positive
alternative for some people,

915
53:48
particularly those who find
that their depression is very

916
53:52
tied-up in recurrent themes in
their relationships that seem to

917
53:56
happen over and over and over
again.

918
53:58
But to end, the good news about
depression is that there are

919
54:01
these alternative therapies.
There is a number of drug

920
54:04
therapies and there are at least
two psychotherapies that good

921
54:08
controlled research has shown
can be very helpful.

922
54:11
So, people have a choice,
and there is absolutely no need

923
54:15
for people to stay in depression
but rather to seek out the kind

924
54:19
of therapy that applies to and
appeals to them the most.

925
54:24
Good.
Thanks very much.
