Professor Paul Bloom:
I actually want to begin by

2
0:15
going back to Freud and hitting
a couple of loose ends.

3
0:17
There was a point in my lecture
on Wednesday where I skipped

4
0:21
over some parts.
I said, "We don't have time for

5
0:24
this" and I just whipped past
it.

6
0:26
And I couldn't sleep over the
weekend.

7
0:28
I've been tormented.
I shouldn't have skipped that

8
0:31
and I want to hit--Let me tell
you why I skipped it.

9
0:35
The discussion I skipped was
the discussion of why we would

10
0:39
have an unconscious at all.
So, I was talking about the

11
0:42
scientifically respectable ideas
of Freud and I want to talk

12
0:46
about some new ideas about why
there could be an unconscious.

13
0:51
Now, the reason why I skipped
it is I'm not sure this is the

14
0:55
best way to look at the
question.

15
0:58
As we will learn throughout the
course, by far the vast majority

16
1:02
of what our brains do,
the vast majority of what our

17
1:06
minds do, is unconscious and
we're unaware of it.

18
1:09
So the right question to ask
may not be, "Why are some things

19
1:13
unconscious?"
but rather, why is this tiny

20
1:17
subset of mental life--why is
this conscious?

21
1:20
On the other hand,
these claims about the utility

22
1:23
of unconsciousness,
I think, are provocative and

23
1:26
interesting.
So I just wanted to quickly

24
1:29
share them with you.
So, the question is,

25
1:32
from an evolutionary
standpoint, "Why would an

26
1:34
unconscious evolve?"
And an answer that some

27
1:38
psychologists and biologists
have given is deception.

28
1:43
So, most animals do some
deception.

29
1:46
And deception defined broadly
is simply to act or be in some

30
1:50
way that fools others into
believing or thinking or

31
1:53
responding to something that's
false.

32
1:56
There's physical examples of
deception.

33
2:00
When threatened,
chimpanzees--their hair stands

34
2:03
up on end and that makes them
look bigger to fool others to

35
2:06
thinking they're more dangerous
than they are.

36
2:09
There's an angler fish at the
bottom of the ocean that has a

37
2:13
rod sticking up from the top of
its head with a lure to capture

38
2:16
other fish – to fool them in
thinking that this is something

39
2:20
edible and then to themselves be
devoured.

40
2:22
But humans, primates in general
but particularly humans,

41
2:27
are masters of deception.
We use our minds and our

42
2:32
behaviors and our actions
continually to try to trick

43
2:35
people into believing what's not
true.

44
2:38
We try to trick people,
for instance,

45
2:40
into believing that we're
tougher, smarter,

46
2:43
sexier, more reliable,
more trustworthy and so on,

47
2:48
than we really are.
And a large part of social

48
2:51
psychology concerns the way in
which we present ourselves to

49
2:54
other people so as to make the
maximally positive impression

50
2:57
even when that impression isn't
true.

51
3:00
At the same time,
though, we've also evolved very

52
3:05
good lie detection mechanisms.
So not only is there

53
3:09
evolutionary pressure for me to
lie to you, for me to persuade

54
3:13
you for instance,
that if we're going to have

55
3:15
a--if you are threatening me
don't threaten me,

56
3:18
I am not the sort of man you
could screw around with.

57
3:21
But there's evolutionary
pressure for you to look and

58
3:24
say, "No.
You are the sort of man you

59
3:25
could screw around with.
I can tell."

60
3:27
So how do you become a good
liar?

61
3:31
And here's where the
unconscious comes in.

62
3:34
The hypothesis is:
the best lies are lies we tell

63
3:38
ourselves.
You're a better liar,

64
3:41
more generally,
if you believe the lie that

65
3:45
you're telling.
This could be illustrated with

66
3:50
a story about Alfred Hitchcock.
The story goes--He hated

67
3:54
working with child actors but he
often had to.

68
3:58
And the story goes--He was
dealing with a child actor who

69
4:02
simply could not cry.
And, finally frustrated,

70
4:05
Hitchcock went to the actor,
leaned over,

71
4:07
whispered in his ear,
"Your parents have left you and

72
4:11
they're never coming back."
The kid burst into tears.

73
4:14
Hitchcock said,
"Roll ‘em" and filmed the

74
4:18
kid.
And the kid,

75
4:20
if you were to see him,
you'd say, "That's--Boy,

76
4:24
he's--he really looks as if
he's sad" because he was.

77
4:30
If I had a competition where
I'd give $100,000 to the person

78
4:34
who looks the most as if they
are in pain,

79
4:38
it is a very good tactic to
take a pen and jam it into your

80
4:43
groin because you will look
extremely persuasively as if you

81
4:47
are in pain.
If I want to persuade you that

82
4:51
I love you, would never leave
you, you can trust me with

83
4:55
everything, it may be a superb
tactic for me to believe it.

84
4:59
And so, this account of the
evolution of the unconscious is

85
5:05
that certain motivations and
goals,

86
5:08
particularly sinister ones,
are better made to be

87
5:12
unconscious because if a person
doesn't know they have them they

88
5:17
will not give them away.
And this is something I think

89
5:22
we should return to later on
when we talk about social

90
5:26
interaction and social
relationships.

91
5:30
One other thing on Freud--just
a story of the falsification of

92
5:34
Freud.
I was taking my younger child

93
5:37
home from a play date on Sunday
and he asked me out of the blue,

94
5:42
"Why can't you marry your
mother or your father?"

95
5:46
Now, that's actually a
difficult question to ask--to

96
5:49
answer for a child,
but I tried my best to give him

97
5:51
an answer.
And then I said--then I thought

98
5:55
back on the Freud lecture and so
I asked him, "If you could marry

99
6:00
anybody you want,
who would it be?"

100
6:03
imagining he'd make explicit
the Oedipal complex and name his

101
6:07
mother.
Instead, he paused for a moment

102
6:13
and said, "I would marry a
donkey and a big bag of

103
6:23
peanuts."
[laughter]

104
6:26
Both his parents are
psychologists and he hates these

105
6:29
questions and at times he just
screws around with us.

106
6:32
[laughter] Okay.
Last class I started with Freud

107
6:40
and now I want to turn to
Skinner.

108
6:44
And the story of Skinner and
science is somewhat different

109
6:47
from the story of Freud.
Freud developed and championed

110
6:51
the theory of psychoanalysis by
himself.

111
6:55
It is as close as you could
find in science to a solitary

112
6:59
invention.
Obviously, he drew upon all

113
7:01
sorts of sources and
predecessors but psychoanalysis

114
7:05
is identified as Freud's
creation.

115
7:07
Behaviorism is different.
Behaviorism is a school of

116
7:11
thought that was there long
before Skinner,

117
7:15
championed by psychologists
like John Watson,

118
7:19
for instance.
Skinner came a bit late into

119
7:22
this but the reason why we've
heard of Skinner and why Skinner

120
7:26
is so well known is he packaged
these notions.

121
7:29
He expanded upon them;
he publicized them;

122
7:32
he developed them
scientifically and presented

123
7:35
them both to the scientific
community and to the popular

124
7:38
community and sociologically in
the 1960s and 1970s.

125
7:42
In the United States,
behaviorism was incredibly well

126
7:45
known and so was Skinner.
He was the sort of person you

127
7:48
would see on talk shows.
His books were bestsellers.

128
7:52
Now, at the core of behaviorism
are three extremely radical and

129
7:59
interesting views.
The first is a strong emphasis

130
8:04
on learning.
The strong view of behaviorism

131
8:08
is everything you know,
everything you are,

132
8:12
is the result of experience.
There's no real human nature.

133
8:17
Rather, people are infinitely
malleable.

134
8:21
There's a wonderful quote from
John Watson and in this quote

135
8:25
John Watson is paraphrasing a
famous boast by the Jesuits.

136
8:29
The Jesuits used to claim,
"Give me a child until the age

137
8:34
of seven and I'll show you the
man,"

138
8:37
that they would take a child
and turn him into anything they

139
8:41
wanted.
And Watson expanded on this

140
8:44
boast,
Give me a dozen healthy

141
8:46
infants, well-formed and my own
specified world to bring them up

142
8:48
and I'll guarantee to take any
one at random and train them to

143
8:51
become any type of specialist I
might select--doctor,

144
8:54
lawyer, artist,
merchant, chief,

145
8:56
and yes, even beggar-man and
thief, regardless of his

146
8:59
talents,
penchants, tendencies,

147
9:02
abilities, vocations and race
of his ancestors.

148
9:05
Now, you could imagine--You
could see in this a tremendous

149
9:09
appeal to this view because
Watson has an extremely

150
9:13
egalitarian view in a sense.
If there's no human nature,

151
9:18
then there's no sense in which
one group of humans by dint of

152
9:22
their race or their sex could be
better than another group.

153
9:26
And Watson was explicit.
None of those facts about

154
9:29
people will ever make any
difference.

155
9:32
What matters to what you are is
what you learn and how you're

156
9:37
treated.
And so, Watson claimed he could

157
9:40
create anybody in any way simply
by treating them in a certain

158
9:44
fashion.

159
9:45


160
9:49
A second aspect of behaviorism
was anti-mentalism.

161
9:55
And what I mean by this is the
behaviorists were obsessed with

162
9:59
the idea of doing science and
they felt,

163
10:01
largely in reaction to Freud,
that claims about internal

164
10:05
mental states like desires,
wishes, goals,

165
10:08
emotions and so on,
are unscientific.

166
10:11
These invisible,
vague things can never form the

167
10:15
basis of a serious science.
And so, the behaviorist

168
10:19
manifesto would then be to
develop a science without

169
10:23
anything that's unobservable and
instead use notions like

170
10:27
stimulus and response and
reinforcement and punishment and

171
10:31
environment that refer to real
world and tangible events.

172
10:36
Finally, behaviorists believed
there were no interesting

173
10:41
differences across species.
A behaviorist might admit that

174
10:45
a human can do things that a rat
or pigeon couldn't but a

175
10:49
behaviorist might just say,
"Look.

176
10:52
Those are just general
associative powers that differ"

177
10:55
or they may even deny it.
They might say,

178
10:58
"Humans and rats aren't
different at all.

179
11:00
It's just humans tend to live
in a richer environment than

180
11:03
rats."
From that standpoint,

181
11:05
from that theoretical
standpoint, comes a

182
11:08
methodological approach which
is,

183
11:10
if they're all the same then
you could study human learning

184
11:15
by studying nonhuman animals.
And that's a lot of what they

185
11:19
did.
Okay.

186
11:20
I'm going to frame my
introduction--my discussion of

187
11:24
behaviors in terms of the three
main learning principles that

188
11:29
they argue can explain all of
human mental life,

189
11:33
all of human behavior.
And then, I want to turn to

190
11:36
objections to behaviorism but
these three principles are

191
11:39
powerful and very interesting.

192
11:41


193
11:45
The first is habituation.
This is the very simplest form

194
11:50
of learning.
And what this is is technically

195
11:53
described as a decline in the
tendency to respond to stimuli

196
11:58
that are familiar due to
repeated exposure.

197
12:02
"Hey!"
"Hey!"

198
12:09
The sudden noise startles but
as it--as you hear it a second

199
12:16
time it startles less.
The third time is just me being

200
12:20
goofy.
It's just--It's--You get used

201
12:24
to things.
And this, of course,

202
12:26
is common enough in everyday
life.

203
12:28
We get used to the ticking of a
clock or to noise of traffic but

204
12:34
it's actually a very important
form of learning because imagine

205
12:40
life without it.
Imagine life where you never

206
12:43
got used to anything,
where suddenly somebody steps

207
12:46
forward and waves their hand and
you'd go,

208
12:48
"Woah," and then they wave
their hand again and you'd go,

209
12:52
"Whoah," and you
keep--[laughter]

210
12:54
And there's the loud ticking of
a clock and you say,

211
12:57
"Hmmm."
And that's not the way animals

212
13:03
or humans work.
You get used to things.

213
13:06
And it's actually critically
important to get used to things

214
13:10
because it's a useful adaptive
mechanism to keep track on new

215
13:15
events and objects.
It's important to notice

216
13:17
something when it's new because
then you have to decide whether

217
13:20
it's going to harm you,
how to deal with it,

218
13:24
to attend to it,
but you can't keep on noticing

219
13:28
it.
And, in fact,

220
13:29
you should stop noticing it
after it's been in the

221
13:32
environment for long enough.
So, this counts as learning

222
13:36
because it happens through
experience.

223
13:38
It's a way to learn through
experience, to change your way

224
13:41
of thinking through experience.
And also, it's useful because

225
13:44
harmful stimuli are noticed but
when something has shown itself

226
13:50
to be part of the environment
you don't notice it anymore.

227
13:55
The existence of habituation is
important for many reasons.

228
13:59
One thing it's important for is
clever developmental

229
14:03
psychologists have used
habituation as a way to study

230
14:07
people,
creatures who can't talk like

231
14:10
nonhuman animals,
and young babies.

232
14:13
And when I talk on Wednesday
about developmental psychology

233
14:18
I'll show different ways in
which psychologists have used

234
14:22
habituation to study the minds
of young babies.

235
14:25
The second sort of learning is
known as classical conditioning.

236
14:31
And what this is in a very
general sense is the learning of

237
14:36
an association between one
stimulus and another stimulus,

238
14:40
where stimulus is a technical
term meaning events in the

239
14:44
environment like a certain smell
or sound or sight.

240
14:48
It was thought up by Pavlov.
This is Pavlov's famous dog and

241
14:56
it's an example of scientific
serendipity.

242
14:59
Pavlov, when he started this
research, had no interest at all

243
15:04
in learning.
He was interested in saliva.

244
15:08
And to get saliva he had to
have dogs.

245
15:11
And he had to attach something
to dogs so that their saliva

246
15:15
would pour out so he could study
saliva.

247
15:17
No idea why he wanted to study
saliva, but he then discovered

248
15:22
something.
What he would do is he'd put

249
15:24
food powder in the dog's mouth
to generate saliva.

250
15:27
But Pavlov observed that when
somebody entered the room who

251
15:33
typically gave him the food
powder,

252
15:36
the dog--the food powder saliva
would start to come out.

253
15:39
And later on if you--right
before or right during you give

254
15:44
the dog some food – you ping a
bell – the bell will cause the

255
15:50
saliva to come forth.
And, in fact,

256
15:53
this is the apparatus that he
used for his research.

257
15:56


258
16:00
He developed the theory of
classical conditioning by making

259
16:05
a distinction between two sorts
of conditioning,

260
16:09
two sorts of stimulus response
relationships.

261
16:13
One is unconditioned.
An unconditioned is when an

262
16:17
unconditioned stimulus gives
rise to an unconditioned

263
16:19
response.
And this is what you start off

264
16:22
with.
So, if somebody pokes you with

265
16:25
a stick and you say,
"Ouch," because it hurts,

266
16:28
the poking and the "ouch" is an
unconditioned stimulus causing

267
16:31
an unconditioned response.
You didn't have to learn that.

268
16:35
When Pavlov put food powder in
the dog's mouth and saliva was

269
16:39
generated, that's an
unconditioned stimulus giving

270
16:42
rise to an unconditioned
response.

271
16:44
But what happens through
learning is that another

272
16:48
association develops – that
between the conditioned stimulus

273
16:53
and the conditioned response.
So when Pavlov,

274
16:56
for instance--Well,
when Pavlov,

275
16:58
for instance,
started before conditioning

276
17:00
there was simply an
unconditioned stimulus,

277
17:03
the food in the mouth,
and an unconditioned response,

278
17:06
saliva.
The bell was nothing.

279
17:07
The bell was a neutral stimulus.
But over and over again,

280
17:12
if you put the bell and the
food together,

281
17:16
pretty soon the bell will
generate saliva.

282
17:20
And now the bell--When--You
start off with the unconditioned

283
17:24
stimulus, unconditioned
response.

284
17:26
When the conditioned stimulus
and the unconditioned stimulus

285
17:29
are brought together over and
over and over again,

286
17:32
pretty soon the conditioned
stimulus gives rise to the

287
17:36
response.
And now it's known as the

288
17:39
conditioned stimulus giving rise
to the conditioned response.

289
17:43
This is discussed in detail in
the textbook but I also--I'm

290
17:46
going to give you--Don't panic
if you don't get it quite now.

291
17:49
I'm going to give you further
and further examples.

292
17:52
So, the idea here is,
repeated pairings of the

293
17:55
unconditioned stimulus and the
conditioned stimulus will give

294
18:00
rise to the response.
And there's a difference

295
18:03
between reinforced trials and
unreinforced trials.

296
18:06
A reinforced trial is when the
conditioned stimulus and the

297
18:09
unconditioned stimulus go
together.

298
18:11
You're--and to put it in a
crude way, you're teaching the

299
18:16
dog that the bell goes with the
food.

300
18:18
An unreinforced trial is when
you get the food without the

301
18:25
bell.
You're not teaching the dog

302
18:27
this.
And, in fact,

303
18:29
once you teach an animal
something, if you stop doing the

304
18:32
teaching the response goes away
and this is known as extinction.

305
18:35
But here's a graph.
If you get--They really count

306
18:40
the number of cubic centimeters
of saliva.

307
18:43
The dog is trained so that when
the bell comes on--Actually,

308
18:47
I misframed it.
I'll try again.

309
18:49
When the bell comes connected
with food, there's a lot of

310
18:54
saliva.
An unreinforced response is

311
18:56
when the bell goes on but
there's no food.

312
18:59
So, it's--Imagine you're the
dog.

313
19:02
So, you get food in your mouth,
"bell, food,

314
19:06
bell, food," and now "bell."
But next you get "bell,

315
19:12
bell, bell."
You give it up.

316
19:15
You stop.
You stop responding to the bell.

317
19:21
A weird thing which is
discussed in the textbook is if

318
19:25
you wait a while and then you
try it again with the bell after

319
19:29
a couple of hours,
the saliva comes back.

320
19:33
This is known as spontaneous
recovery.

321
19:36
So, this all seems a very
technical phenomena related to

322
19:41
animals and the like but it's
easy to see how it generalizes

323
19:46
and how it extends.
One interesting notion is that

324
19:50
of stimulus generalization.
And stimulus generalization is

325
19:54
the topic of one of your
articles in The Norton

326
19:57
Reader,
the one by Watson,

327
20:00
John Watson,
the famous behaviorist,

328
20:02
who reported a bizarre
experiment with a baby known as

329
20:06
Little Albert.
And here's the idea.

330
20:09
Little Albert originally liked
rats.

331
20:12
In fact, I'm going to show you
a movie of Little Albert

332
20:14
originally liking rats.

333
20:15


334
20:18
See.
He's okay.

335
20:20
No problem.
Now, Watson did something

336
20:24
interesting.
As Little Albert was playing

337
20:28
with the rat,
"Oh, I like rats,

338
20:30
oh," Watson went behind the
baby--this is the--it's in the

339
20:34
chapter--and banged the metal
bar right here .

340
20:38
The baby, "Aah," screamed,
started to sob.

341
20:41
Okay.
What's the unconditioned

342
20:47
stimulus?
Somebody.

343
20:51
The loud noise,
the bar, the bang.

344
20:53
What's the unconditioned
response?

345
20:56
Crying, sadness, misery.
And as a result of this,

346
21:03
Little Albert grew afraid of
the rat.

347
21:07
So there--what would be the
conditioned stimulus?

348
21:13
The rat.
What would be the conditioned

349
21:15
response?
Fear.

350
21:17
Excellent.
Moreover, this fear extended to

351
21:21
other things.
So, this is a very weird and

352
21:24
unpersuasive clip.
But the idea is--the clip is to

353
21:28
make the point that the fear
will extend to a rabbit,

354
21:31
a white rabbit.
So, the first part,

355
21:33
Little Albert's fine with the
white rabbit.

356
21:36
The second part is after he's
been conditioned and he's kind

357
21:39
of freaked out with the white
rabbit.

358
21:40
The problem is in the second
part they're throwing the rabbit

359
21:45
at him but now he's okay.

360
21:47


361
22:05
[laughter] Is the mic on?
Oh.

362
22:08
This is fine.
This is one of a long list of

363
22:14
experiments that we can't do
anymore.

364
22:18
So, classical conditioning is
more than a laboratory

365
22:23
phenomena.
The findings of classical

366
22:27
conditioning have been extended
and replicated in all sorts of

367
22:34
animals including crabs,
fish, cockroaches and so on.

368
22:40
And it's been argued to be an
extension of--it's argued to

369
22:46
underlie certain interesting
aspects of human responses.

370
22:53
So, I have some examples here.
One example is fear.

371
22:56
So, the Little Albert idea--The
Little Albert experiment,

372
23:01
provides an illustration for
how phobias could emerge.

373
23:05
Some proportion of people in
this room have phobias.

374
23:08
Imagine you're afraid of dogs.
Well, a possible story for

375
23:13
the--for why you became afraid
of dogs is that one day a dog

376
23:18
came up and he was a neutral
stimulus.

377
23:21
No problem.
And all of a sudden he bit you.

378
23:24
Now the pain of a bite,
being bit, and then the pain

379
23:28
and fear of that is an
unconditioned stimulus,

380
23:31
unconditioned response.
You're just born with that,

381
23:34
"ow."
But the presence of the dog

382
23:36
there is a conditioned stimulus
and so you grew to be afraid of

383
23:40
dogs.
If you believe this,

384
23:43
this also forms the basis for
ways for a theory of how you

385
23:48
could make phobias go away.
How do you make conditioned

386
23:52
stimulus, conditioned response
things go away?

387
23:55
Well, what you do is you
extinguish them.

388
23:58
How do you extinguish them?
Well, you show the thing that

389
24:01
would cause you to have the fear
without the unconditioned

390
24:06
stimulus.
Here's an illustration.

391
24:09
It's a joke.
Sorry.

392
24:11
He's simultaneously confronting
the fear of heights,

393
24:15
snakes, and the dark because
he's trapped in that thing and

394
24:18
the logic is--the logic of--the
logic is not bad.

395
24:22
He's stuck in there.
Those are all the--his

396
24:24
conditioned stimulus.
But nothing bad happens so his

397
24:27
fear goes away.
The problem with this is while

398
24:31
he's stuck in there he has this
screaming, horrific panic attack

399
24:35
and then it makes his fear much
worse.

400
24:38
So, what they do now though,
and we'll talk about this much

401
24:41
later in the course when we talk
about clinical psychology--but

402
24:45
one cure for phobias does draw
upon,

403
24:47
in a more intelligent way,
the behaviorist literature.

404
24:50
So, the claim about a phobia is
that there's a bad association

405
24:55
between, say dog and fear,
or between airplanes or snakes

406
24:59
and some bad response.
So, what they do is what's

407
25:03
called, "systematic
desensitization," which is they

408
25:06
expose you to what causes you
the fear but they relax you at

409
25:10
the same time so you replace the
aversive classical conditioned

410
25:14
fear with something more
positive.

411
25:17
Traditionally,
they used to teach people

412
25:20
relaxation exercises but that
proves too difficult.

413
25:23
So nowadays they just pump you
full of some drug to get you

414
25:26
really happy and so you're
really stoned out of your head,

415
25:29
you're and this isn't so bad.
It's more complicated than that

416
25:34
but the notion is you can use
these associative tools perhaps

417
25:38
to deal with questions about
fear,

418
25:41
phobias and how they go away.
Hunger.

419
25:48
We'll spend some time in this
course discussing why we eat and

420
25:53
when we eat.
And one answer to why we eat

421
25:55
and when we eat is that there's
cues in the environment that are

422
25:58
associated with eating.
And these cues generate hunger.

423
26:02
For those of you who are trying
to quit smoking,

424
26:05
you'll notice that there's
time--or to quit drinking

425
26:09
there's times of the day or
certain activities that really

426
26:13
make you want to smoke or really
make you want to drink.

427
26:17
And from a behaviorist point of
view this is because of the

428
26:21
associative history of these
things.

429
26:24
More speculatively,
classical conditioning has been

430
26:29
argued to be implicated in the
formation of sexual desire,

431
26:34
including fetishes.
So a behaviorist story about

432
26:38
fetishes, for instance,
is it's straightforward

433
26:41
classical conditioning.
Just as your lover's caress

434
26:46
brings you to orgasm,
your eyes happen to fall upon a

435
26:52
shoe.
Through the simple tools of

436
26:55
classical conditioning then,
the shoe becomes a conditioned

437
26:59
stimulus giving rise to the
conditioned response of sexual

438
27:03
pleasure.
This almost certainly is not

439
27:06
the right story but again,
just as in phobias,

440
27:09
some ideas of classical
conditioning may play some role

441
27:13
in determining what we like and
what we don't like sexually.

442
27:17
And in fact,
one treatment for pedophiles

443
27:20
and rapists involved controlled
fantasies during masturbation to

444
27:25
shift the association from
domination and violence,

445
27:30
for instance,
to develop more positive

446
27:33
associations with sexual
pleasure.

447
27:36
So the strong classical
conditioning stories about

448
27:39
fetishes and fears sound silly
and extreme and they probably

449
27:44
are but at the same time
classical conditioning can be

450
27:47
used at least to shape the focus
of our desires and of our

451
27:51
interests.
Final thought actually is--Oh,

452
27:54
yeah.
Okay.

453
27:55
So, what do we think about
classical conditioning?

454
27:58
We talked about what
habituation is for.

455
28:00
What's classical conditioning
for?

456
28:01
Well, the traditional view is
it's not for anything.

457
28:04
It's just association.
So, what happens is the UCS and

458
28:07
the CS, the bell and the food,
go together because they happen

459
28:11
at the same time.
And so classical conditioning

460
28:14
should be the strongest when
these two are simultaneous and

461
28:19
the response to one is the same
as the response to the other.

462
28:23
This is actually no longer the
mainstream view.

463
28:27
The mainstream view is now a
little bit more interesting.

464
28:29
It's that what happens in
classical conditioning is

465
28:33
preparation.
What happens is you become

466
28:36
sensitive to a cue that an event
is about to happen and that

467
28:41
allows you to prepare for the
event.

468
28:44
This makes certain predictions.
It predicts that the best

469
28:48
timing is when the conditioned
stimulus, which is the signal,

470
28:52
comes before the unconditioned
stimulus, which is what you have

471
28:55
to prepare for.
And it says the conditioned

472
28:58
response may be different from
the unconditioned response.

473
29:02
So, move away from food.
Imagine a child who's being

474
29:06
beaten by his father.
And when his father raises his

475
29:10
hand he flinches.
Well, that's classical

476
29:13
conditioning.
What happened in that case is

477
29:16
he has learned that the raising
of a hand is a signal that he is

478
29:20
about to be hit and so he
responds to that signal.

479
29:24
His flinch is not the same
response that one would give if

480
29:29
one's hit.
If you're hit, you don't flinch.

481
29:31
If you're hit,
you might feel pain or bounce

482
29:33
back or something.
Flinching is preparation for

483
29:36
being hit.
And, in general,

484
29:38
the idea of what goes on in
classical conditioning is that

485
29:41
the response is sort of a
preparation.

486
29:44
The conditioned response is a
preparation for the

487
29:47
unconditioned stimulus.
Classical conditioning shows up

488
29:50
all over the place.
As a final exercise,

489
29:53
and I had to think about
it--Has anybody here seen the

490
29:56
movie "Clockwork Orange"?
A lot of you.

491
29:59
It's kind of a shocking movie
and unpleasant and very violent

492
30:03
but at its core one of the main
themes is right out of Intro

493
30:08
Psych.
It's classical conditioning.

494
30:10
And a main character,
who is a violent murderer and

495
30:14
rapist, is brought in by some
psychologists for some therapy.

496
30:19
And the therapy he gets is
classical conditioning.

497
30:22
In particular,
what happens is he is given a

498
30:25
drug that makes him violently
ill, extremely nauseous.

499
30:28
And then his eyes are propped
open and he's shown scenes of

500
30:32
violence.
As a result of this sort of

501
30:34
conditioning,
he then – when he experiences

502
30:38
real world violence – he
responds with nausea and shock;

503
30:42
basically, training him to get
away from these acts of

504
30:50
violence.
In this example--Take a moment.

505
30:53
Don't say it aloud.
Just take a moment.

506
30:55
What's the unconditioned
stimulus?

507
30:59
Okay.
Anybody, what's the

508
31:01
unconditioned stimulus?
Somebody just say it.

509
31:03
The drug.
What's the unconditioned

510
31:08
response?
Nausea.

511
31:10
What's the conditioned stimulus?
Violence.

512
31:14
What's the conditioned response?
Perfect.

513
31:19
The third and final type of
learning is known as operant

514
31:24
conditioning or instrumental
conditioning.

515
31:28
And this is the thing,
this is the theory championed

516
31:32
and developed most extensively
by Skinner.

517
31:36
What this is is learning the
relationships between what you

518
31:41
do and how successful or
unsuccessful they are,

519
31:45
learning what works and what
doesn't.

520
31:48
It's important.
This is very different from

521
31:50
classical conditioning and one
way to see how this is different

522
31:54
is for classical conditioning
you don't do anything.

523
31:56
You could literally be strapped
down and be immobile and these

524
32:01
connections are what you
appreciate and you make

525
32:04
connections in your mind.
Instrumental conditioning is

526
32:08
voluntary.
You choose to do things and by

527
32:12
dint of your choices.
Some choices become more

528
32:18
learned than others.
So, the idea itself was

529
32:24
developed in the nicest form by
Thorndike who explored how

530
32:29
animals learn.
Remember behaviorists were

531
32:32
entirely comfortable studying
animals and drawing

532
32:35
extrapolations to other animals
and to humans.

533
32:38
So, he would put a cat in a
puzzle box.

534
32:41
And the trick to a puzzle box
is there's a simple way to get

535
32:45
out but you have to kind of pull
on something,

536
32:48
some special lever,
to make it pop open.

537
32:51
And Thorndike noted that cats
do not solve this problem

538
32:56
through insight.
They don't sit in the box for a

539
33:00
while and mull it over and then
figure out how to do it.

540
33:04
Instead, what they do is they
bounce all around doing

541
33:07
different things and gradually
get better and better at it.

542
33:11
So, what they do is,
the first time they might

543
33:13
scratch at the bars,
push at the ceiling,

544
33:15
dig at the floor,
howl, etc., etc.

545
33:17
And one of their behaviors is
pressing the lever.

546
33:20
The lever gets them out of the
box, but after more and more

547
33:23
trials they stopped scratching
at the bars, pushing at the

548
33:27
ceiling and so on.
They just pressed the lever.

549
33:31
And if you graph it,
they gradually get better and

550
33:34
better.
They throw out all of these

551
33:37
behaviors randomly.
Some of them get reinforced and

552
33:41
those are the ones that survive
and others don't get reinforced

553
33:46
and those are the ones that go
extinct.

554
33:49
And it might occur to some of
you that this seems to be an

555
33:53
analogy with the Darwinian
theory of natural selection

556
33:57
where there's a random
assortment of random mutations.

557
34:00
And sexual selections give rise
to a host of organisms,

558
34:04
some of which survive and are
fit and others which aren't.

559
34:08
And in fact,
Skinner explicitly made the

560
34:12
analogy from the natural
selection of species to the

561
34:16
natural selection of behavior.
So this could be summarized as

562
34:21
the law of effect,
which is a tendency to perform

563
34:25
– an action's increased if
rewarded, weakened if it's not.

564
34:30
And Skinner extended this more
generally.

565
34:34
So, to illustrate Skinnerian
theory in operant conditioning

566
34:39
I'll give an example of training
a pig.

567
34:43
So here is the idea.
You need to train a pig and you

568
34:47
need to do so through operant
conditioning.

569
34:51
So one of the things you want
to do is--The pig is going to do

570
34:55
some things you like and some
things you don't like.

571
34:58
And so what you want to do,
basically drawing upon the law

572
35:03
of effect, is reinforce the pig
for doing good things.

573
35:08
Suppose you want the pig to
walk forward.

574
35:10
So, you reinforce the pig for
walking forward and you punish

575
35:14
the pig for walking backward.
And if you do that over the

576
35:18
fullness of time,
your reinforcement and

577
35:20
punishment will give rise to a
pig who walks forward.

578
35:24
There's two--One technical
distinction that people love to

579
35:28
put on Intro Psych exams is that
the difference between positive

580
35:32
reinforcement and negative
reinforcement.

581
35:35
Reinforcement is something that
makes the behavior increase.

582
35:40
Negative reinforcement is very
different from punishment.

583
35:44
Negative reinforcement is just
a type of reward.

584
35:47
The difference is in positive
reinforcement you do something;

585
35:51
in negative reinforcement you
take away something aversive.

586
35:55
So, imagine the pig has a heavy
collar and to reward the pig for

587
35:59
walking forward you might remove
the heavy collar.

588
36:02
So, these are the basic
techniques to train an animal.

589
36:07
But it's kind of silly because
suppose you want your pig to

590
36:11
dance.
You don't just want your pig to

591
36:14
walk forward.
You want your pig to dance.

592
36:17
Well, you can't adopt the
policy of "I'm going to wait for

593
36:21
this pig to dance and when it
does I'm going to reinforce it"

594
36:25
because it's going to take you a
very long time.

595
36:29
Similarly, if you're dealing
with immature humans and you

596
36:33
want your child to get you a
beer,

597
36:36
you can't just sit,
wait for the kid to give you a

598
36:39
beer and uncap the bottle and
say,

599
36:42
"Excellent.
Good.

600
36:43
Hugs."
You've got to work your way to

601
36:47
it.
And the act of working your way

602
36:50
to it is known as shaping.
So, here is how to get a pig to

603
36:55
dance.
You wait for the pig to do

604
36:58
something that's halfway close
to dancing, like stumbling,

605
37:02
and you reward it.
Then it does something else

606
37:05
that's even closer to dancing
and you reward it.

607
37:08
And you keep rewarding it as it
gets closer to closer.

608
37:12
Here's how to get your child to
bring you some beer.

609
37:16
You say, "Johnny,
could you go to the kitchen and

610
37:19
get me some beer?"
And he walks to the kitchen and

611
37:21
then he forgets why he's there
and you run out there.

612
37:24
"You're such a good kid.
Congratulations.

613
37:25
Hugs."
And then you get him to--and

614
37:28
then finally you get him to also
open up the refrigerator and get

615
37:32
the beer,
open the door,

616
37:34
get the--and in that way you
can train creatures to do

617
37:37
complicated things.
Skinner had many examples of

618
37:41
this.
Skinner developed,

619
37:43
in World War II,
a pigeon guided missile.

620
37:46
It was never actually used but
it was a great idea.

621
37:50
And people, in fact--The
history of the military in the

622
37:54
United States and other
countries includes a lot of

623
37:57
attempts to get animals like
pigeons or dolphins to do

624
38:01
interesting and deadly things
through various training.

625
38:05
More recreational,
Skinner was fond of teaching

626
38:08
animals to play Ping-Pong.
And again, you don't teach an

627
38:11
animal to play Ping-Pong by
waiting for it to play Ping-Pong

628
38:14
and then rewarding it.
Rather, you reward

629
38:19
approximations to it.
And basically,

630
38:24
there are primary reinforcers.
There are some things pigs

631
38:28
naturally like,
food for instance.

632
38:31
There are some things pigs
actually automatically don't

633
38:34
like, like being hit or shocked.
But in the real world when

634
38:38
dealing with humans,
but even when dealing with

635
38:41
animals,
we don't actually always use

636
38:43
primary reinforcers or negative
reinforcers.

637
38:46
What we often use are things
like--for my dog saying,

638
38:51
"Good dog."
Now, saying "Good dog" is not

639
38:54
something your dog has been
built, pre-wired,

640
38:58
to find pleasurable.
But what happens is you can do

641
39:02
a two-step process.
You can make "Good dog"

642
39:05
positive through classical
conditioning.

643
39:08
You give the dog a treat and
say, "Good dog."

644
39:11
Now the phrase "good dog" will
carry the rewarding quality.

645
39:16
And you could use that
rewarding quality in order to

646
39:19
train it.
And through this way

647
39:21
behaviorists have developed
token economies where they get

648
39:25
nonhuman animals to do
interesting things for seemingly

649
39:29
arbitrary rewards like poker
chips.

650
39:32
And in this way you can
increase the utility and ease of

651
39:38
training.
Finally, in the examples we're

652
39:42
giving, whenever the pig does
something you like you reinforce

653
39:47
it.
But that's not how real life

654
39:50
works.
Real life for both humans and

655
39:53
animals involved cases where the
reinforcement doesn't happen all

656
39:58
the time but actually happens
according to different

657
40:02
schedules.
And so, there is the

658
40:04
distinction between fixed
schedules versus ratios –

659
40:08
variable schedules and ratio
versus interval.

660
40:11
And this is something you could
print out to look at.

661
40:13
I don't need to go over it in
detail.

662
40:15
The difference between ratio is
a reward every certain number of

663
40:20
times somebody does something.
So, if every tenth time your

664
40:26
dog brought you the newspaper
you gave it hugs and treats;

665
40:31
that's ratio.
An interval is over a period of

666
40:35
time.
So, if your dog gives you--if

667
40:38
your dog, I don't know,
dances for an hour straight,

668
40:42
that would be an interval
thing.

669
40:45
And fixed versus variable
speaks to whether you give a

670
40:49
reward on a fixed schedule,
every fifth time,

671
40:52
or variable,
sometimes on the third time,

672
40:55
sometimes on the seventh time,
and so on.

673
40:57
And these are--There are
examples here and there's no

674
41:00
need to go over them.
It's easy enough to think of

675
41:03
examples in real life.
So, for example,

676
41:07
a slot machine is variable
ratio.

677
41:12
It goes off after it's been hit
a certain number of times.

678
41:16
It doesn't matter how long it
takes you for--to do it.

679
41:19
It's the number of times you
pull it down.

680
41:21
But it's variable because it
doesn't always go off on the

681
41:24
thousandth time.
You don't know.

682
41:26
It's unpredictable.
The slot machine is a good

683
41:30
example of a phenomena known as
the partial reinforcement

684
41:35
effect.
And this is kind of neat.

685
41:38
It makes sense when you hear it
but it's the sort of finding

686
41:42
that's been validated over and
over again with animals and

687
41:45
nonhumans.
Here's the idea.

688
41:49
Suppose you want to train
somebody to do something and you

689
41:52
want the training such that
they'll keep on doing it even if

690
41:56
you're not training them
anymore,

691
41:58
which is typically what you
want.

692
42:01
If you want that,
the trick is don't reinforce it

693
42:06
all the time.
Behaviors last longer if

694
42:10
they're reinforced
intermittently and this is known

695
42:13
as "the partial reinforcement
effect."

696
42:17
Thinking of this
psychologically,

697
42:19
it's as if whenever you put
something in a slot machine it

698
42:22
gave you money,
then all of a sudden it

699
42:25
stopped.
You keep on doing it a few

700
42:28
times but then you say,
"Fine.

701
42:30
It doesn't work," but what if
it gave you money one out of

702
42:33
every hundred times?
Now you keep on trying and

703
42:37
because the reinforcement is
intermittent you don't expect it

704
42:43
as much and so your behavior
will persist across often a huge

705
42:49
amount of time.
Here's a good example.

706
42:52
What's the very worst thing to
do when your kid cries to go

707
42:57
into bed with you and you don't
want him to go into bed with

708
43:01
you?
Well, one--The worst thing to

709
43:04
do is for any--Actually,
for any form of discipline with

710
43:08
a kid is to say,
"No, absolutely not.

711
43:10
No, no, no, no."
"Okay."

712
43:15
And then later on the kid's
going to say,

713
43:19
"I want to do it again" and you
say no and the kid keeps asking

714
43:24
because you've put it,
well, put it as in a

715
43:28
psychological way,
not the way the behaviorists

716
43:30
would put it.
The kid knows okay,

717
43:32
he's not going to get it right
away, he's going to keep on

718
43:34
asking.
And so typically,

719
43:36
what you're doing inadvertently
in those situations is you're

720
43:40
exploiting the partial
reinforcement effect.

721
43:44
If I want my kid to do
something, I should say yes one

722
43:47
out of every ten times.
Unfortunately,

723
43:50
that's the evolution of
nagging.

724
43:53
Because you nag,
you nag, you nag,

725
43:57
the person says,
"Fine, okay," and that

726
44:01
reinforces it.
If Skinner kept the focus on

727
44:05
rats and pigeons and dogs,
he would not have the impact

728
44:10
that he did but he argued that
you could extend all of these

729
44:14
notions to humans and to human
behavior.

730
44:18
So for an example,
he argued that the prison

731
44:21
system needs to be reformed
because instead of focusing on

732
44:26
notions of justice and
retribution what we should do is

733
44:30
focus instead on questions of
reinforcing good behaviors and

734
44:34
punishing bad ones.
He argued for the notions of

735
44:39
operant conditioning to be
extended to everyday life and

736
44:43
argued that people's lives would
become fuller and more

737
44:48
satisfying if they were
controlled in a properly

738
44:51
behaviorist way.
Any questions about behaviorism?

739
44:55


740
45:01
What are your questions about
behaviorism?

741
45:03


742
45:12
[laughter] Yes.
Student:

743
45:16
[inaudible]--wouldn't there be
extinction after a while?

744
45:20
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

745
45:20
Good question.
The discussion was over using

746
45:23
things like poker chips for
reinforcement and the point is

747
45:27
exactly right.
Since the connection with the

748
45:29
poker chips is established
through classical conditioning,

749
45:32
sooner or later by that logic
the poker chips would lose their

750
45:36
power to serve as reinforcers.
You'd have to sort of start it

751
45:40
up again, retrain again.
If you have a dog and you say

752
45:44
"Good dog" to reward the dog,
by your logic,

753
45:47
which is right,
at some point you might as well

754
45:49
give the dog a treat along with
the "Good dog."

755
45:51
Otherwise, "Good dog" is not
going to cut it anymore.

756
45:53


757
45:59
Yes.
Student:

758
46:01
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

759
46:04
As far as I know,
Skinner and Skinnerian

760
46:06
psychologists were never
directly involved in the

761
46:09
creation of prisons.
On the other hand,

762
46:12
the psychological theory of
behaviorism has had a huge

763
46:15
impact and I think a lot of
people's ways of thinking about

764
46:18
criminal justice and criminal
law has been shaped by

765
46:21
behaviorist principles.
So for instance,

766
46:24
institutions like mental
institutions and some prisons

767
46:28
have installed token economies
where there's rewards for good

768
46:32
behavior,
often poker chips of a sort.

769
46:34
And then you could cash them in
for other things.

770
46:36
And, to some extent,
these have been shaped by an

771
46:40
adherence to behaviorist
principles.

772
46:43
Okay.
So, here are the three general

773
46:52
positions of behaviorism.
(1) That there is no innate

774
46:57
knowledge.
All you need is learning.

775
47:00
(2) That you could explain
human psychology without mental

776
47:04
notions like desires and goals.
(3) And that these mechanisms

777
47:09
apply across all domains and
across all species.

778
47:12


779
47:15
I think it's fair to say that
right now just about everybody

780
47:19
agrees all of these three claims
are mistaken.

781
47:22
First, we know that it's not
true that everything is learned.

782
47:28
There is considerable evidence
for different forms of innate

783
47:31
knowledge and innate desires and
we'll look--and we'll talk about

784
47:35
it in detail when we look at
case studies like language

785
47:38
learning,
the development of sexual

786
47:40
preference, the developing
understanding of material

787
47:44
objects.
There's a lot of debate over

788
47:46
how much is innate and what the
character of the built-in mental

789
47:51
systems are but there's nobody
who doubts nowadays that a

790
47:55
considerable amount for humans
and other animals is built-in.

791
48:00
Is it true that talking about
mental states is unscientific?

792
48:04
Nobody believes this anymore
either.

793
48:09
Science, particularly more
advanced sciences like physics

794
48:12
or chemistry,
are all about unobservables.

795
48:15
They're all about things you
can't see.

796
48:18
And it makes sense to explain
complex and intelligent behavior

797
48:23
in terms of internal mechanisms
and internal representations.

798
48:28
Once again, the computer
revolution has served as an

799
48:32
illustrative case study.
If you have a computer that

800
48:36
plays chess and you want to
explain how the computer plays

801
48:39
chess,
it's impossible to do so

802
48:42
without talking about the
programs and mechanisms inside

803
48:47
the computer.
Is it true that animals need

804
48:50
reinforcement and punishment to
learn?

805
48:52
No, and there's several
demonstrations at the time of

806
48:56
Skinner suggesting that they
don't.

807
48:58
This is from a classic study by
Tolman where rats were taught to

808
49:04
run a maze.
And what they found was the

809
49:06
rats did fine.
They learn to run a maze faster

810
49:09
and faster when they're
regularly rewarded but they also

811
49:12
learn to run a maze faster and
faster if they are not rewarded

812
49:16
at all.
So the reward helps,

813
49:19
but the reward is in no sense
necessary.

814
49:24
And here's a more sophisticated
illustration of the same point.

815
49:29
Professor Paul Bloom:
And this is the sort of

816
49:32
finding, an old finding from
before most of you were born,

817
49:36
that was a huge embarrassment
for the Skinnerian theory,

818
49:40
as it suggests that rats in
fact had mental maps,

819
49:44
an internal mechanism that they
used to understand the world –

820
49:48
entirely contrary to the
behaviorist idea everything

821
49:52
could be explained in terms of
reinforcement and punishment.

822
49:56
Finally, is it true that
there's no animal-specific

823
49:59
constraints for learning?
And again, the answer seems to

824
50:03
be "no."
Animals, for instance,

825
50:05
have natural responses.
So, you could train a pigeon to

826
50:09
peck for food but that's because
pecking for food is a very

827
50:14
natural response.
It's very difficult to train it

828
50:17
to peck to escape a situation.
You can train it to flap its

829
50:22
wings to escape a situation but
it's very difficult to get it to

830
50:26
flap its wings for food.
And the idea is they have sort

831
50:29
of natural responses that these
learning situations might

832
50:32
exploit and might channel,
but essentially,

833
50:35
they do have certain natural
ways of acting towards the

834
50:39
world.
We know that not all stimuli

835
50:43
and responses are created equal.
So, the Gray textbook has a

836
50:49
very nice discussion of the
Garcia effect.

837
50:52
And the Garcia effect goes like
this.

838
50:56
Does anybody here have any food
aversions?

839
51:00
I don't mean foods you don't
like.

840
51:02
I mean foods that really make
you sick.

841
51:07
Often food aversions in humans
and other animals can be formed

842
51:12
through a form of association.
What happens is suppose you

843
51:17
have the flu and you get very
nauseous and then at the same

844
51:21
point you eat some sashimi for
the first time.

845
51:25
The connection between being
nauseous and eating a new food

846
51:28
is very potent.
And even if you know

847
51:31
intellectually full well that
the sashimi isn't why you became

848
51:36
nauseous, still you'll develop
an aversion to this new food.

849
51:42
When I was younger – when I
was a teenager – I drank this

850
51:48
Greek liqueur,
ouzo, with beer.

851
51:51
I didn't have the flu at the
time but I became violently ill.

852
51:55
And as a result I cannot abide
the smell of that Greek liqueur.

853
52:01
Now, thank God it didn't
develop into an aversion to beer

854
52:05
but-- [laughter]
Small miracles.

855
52:07
But the smell is very
distinctive and for me--was new

856
52:11
to me.
And so, through the Garcia

857
52:13
effect I developed a strong
aversion.

858
52:16
What's interesting though is
the aversion is special so if

859
52:19
you take an animal and you give
it a new food and then you give

860
52:23
it a drug to make it nauseous it
will avoid that food.

861
52:27
But if you take an animal and
you give it a new food and then

862
52:32
you shock it very painfully it
won't avoid the new food.

863
52:36
And the idea is that a
connection between what

864
52:39
something tastes and getting
sick is natural.

865
52:43
We are hard wired to say, "Look.
If I'm going to eat a new food

866
52:47
and I'm going to get nauseous,
I'm going to avoid that food."

867
52:50
The Garcia effect is that this
is special to taste and nausea.

868
52:55
It doesn't extend more
generally.

869
52:58
Finally, I talked about phobias
and I'll return to phobias later

870
53:02
on in this course.
But the claim that people have

871
53:06
formed their phobias through
classical conditioning is almost

872
53:11
always wrong.
Instead, it turns out that

873
53:13
there are certain phobias that
we're specially evolved to have.

874
53:17
So, both humans and
chimpanzees, for instance,

875
53:21
are particularly prone to
develop fears of snakes.

876
53:26
And when we talk about the
emotions later on in the course

877
53:29
we'll talk about this in more
detail.

878
53:31
But what seems likely is the
sort of phobias you're likely to

879
53:35
have does not have much to do
with your personal history but

880
53:39
rather it has a lot to do with
your evolutionary history.

881
53:43
Finally, the other reading
you're going to do for this

882
53:47
part--section of the course is
Chomsky's classic article,

883
53:51
his "Review of Verbal
Behavior."

884
53:53
Chomsky is one of the most
prominent intellectuals alive.

885
53:57
He's still a professor at MIT,
still publishes on language and

886
54:01
thought, among other matters.
And the excerpt you're going to

887
54:05
read is from his "Review of
Verbal Behavior."

888
54:07
And this is one of the most
influential intellectual

889
54:11
documents ever written in
psychology because it took the

890
54:14
entire discipline of behaviorism
and,

891
54:17
more than everything else,
more than any other event,

892
54:21
could be said to have destroyed
it or ended it as a dominant

893
54:25
intellectual endeavor.
And Chomsky's argument is

894
54:29
complicated and interesting,
but the main sort of argument

895
54:32
he had to make is--goes like
this.

896
54:35
When it comes to humans,
the notions of reward and

897
54:39
punishment and so on that
Skinner tried to extend to

898
54:44
humans are so vague it's not
science anymore.

899
54:48
And remember the discussion we
had with regard to Freud.

900
54:51
What Skinner--What Chomsky is
raising here is the concern of

901
54:55
unfalsifiablity.
So, here's the sort of example

902
54:57
he would discuss.
Skinner, in his book Verbal

903
55:00
Behavior,
talks about the question of why

904
55:02
do we do things like talk to
ourselves,

905
55:05
imitate sounds,
create art, give bad news to an

906
55:08
enemy, fantasize about pleasant
situations?

907
55:11
And Skinner says that they all
involve reinforcement;

908
55:14
those are all reinforced
behaviors.

909
55:16
But Skinner doesn't literally
mean that when we talk to

910
55:20
ourselves somebody gives us food
pellets.

911
55:24
He doesn't literally mean even
that when we talk to ourselves

912
55:26
somebody pats us on the head and
says, "Good man.

913
55:28
Perfect.
I'm very proud."

914
55:31
What he means,
for instance,

915
55:33
in this case is well,
talking to yourself is

916
55:36
self-reinforcing or giving bad
news to an enemy is reinforcing

917
55:41
because it makes your enemy feel
bad.

918
55:44
Well, Chomsky says the problem
is not that that's wrong.

919
55:48
That's all true.
It's just so vague as to be

920
55:53
useless.
Skinner isn't saying anything

921
55:55
more.
To say giving bad news to an

922
55:58
enemy is reinforcing because it
makes the enemy feel bad doesn't

923
56:02
say anything different from
giving bad news to an enemy

924
56:05
feels good because we like to
give bad news to an enemy.

925
56:09
It's just putting it in more
scientific terms.

926
56:11
More generally,
Chomsky suggests that the law

927
56:16
of effect when applied to humans
is either trivially true,

928
56:22
trivially or uninterestingly
true, or scientifically robust

929
56:28
and obviously false.
So, if you want to expand the

930
56:33
notion of reward or
reinforcement to anything,

931
56:38
then it's true.
So why did you come--those of

932
56:42
you who are not freshmen--Oh,
you--Why did you come?

933
56:46
All of you, why did you come to
Yale for a second semester?

934
56:49
"Well, I repeated my action
because the first semester was

935
56:52
rewarding."
Okay.

936
56:54
What do you mean by that?
Well, you don't literally mean

937
56:57
that somebody rewarded you,
gave you pellets and stuff.

938
57:00
What you mean is you chose to
come there for the second

939
57:03
semester.
And there's nothing wrong with

940
57:06
saying that but we shouldn't
confuse it with science.

941
57:09
And more generally,
the problem is you can talk

942
57:12
about what other people do in
terms of reinforcement and

943
57:15
punishment and operant
conditioning and classical

944
57:17
conditioning.
But in order to do so,

945
57:20
you have to use terms like
"punishment" and "reward" and

946
57:24
"reinforcement" in such a vague
way that in the end you're not

947
57:28
saying anything scientific.
So, behaviorism as a dominant

948
57:33
intellectual field has faded,
but it still leaves behind an

949
57:39
important legacy and it still
stands as one of the major

950
57:44
contributions of twentieth
century psychology.

951
57:49
For one thing,
it has given us a richer

952
57:52
understanding of certain
learning mechanisms,

953
57:54
particularly with regard to
nonhumans.

954
57:56
Mechanisms like habituation,
classical conditioning and

955
57:59
operant conditioning are real;
they can be scientifically

956
58:02
studied;
and they play an important role

957
58:04
in the lives of animals and
probably an important role in

958
58:07
human lives as well.
They just don't explain

959
58:11
everything.
Finally, and this is something

960
58:13
I'm going to return to on
Wednesday actually,

961
58:16
behaviorists have provided
powerful techniques for training

962
58:21
particularly for nonverbal
creatures so this extends to

963
58:26
animal trainers.
But it also extends to people

964
58:29
who want to teach young children
and babies and also want to help

965
58:32
populations like the severely
autistic or the severely

966
58:35
retarded.
Many of these behaviorist

967
58:37
techniques have proven to be
quite useful.

968
58:39
And in that regard,
as well as in other regards,

969
58:43
it stands as an important
contribution.
