Professor Paul Bloom:
I'd like to welcome people to

2
3:43
this course, Introduction to
Psychology.

3
3:45
My name is Dr. Paul Bloom.
I'm professor of this course.

4
3:48
And what this is going to be is
a comprehensive introduction to

5
3:54
the study of the human mind.
So, we are going to cover a

6
3:59
very, very wide range of topics
including brains,

7
4:03
children, language,
sex, memory,

8
4:05
madness, disgust,
racism and love,

9
4:07
and many others.
We're going to talk about

10
4:10
things like the proper
explanation for differences

11
4:13
between men and women;
the question of whether animals

12
4:17
can learn language;
the puzzle of what grosses us

13
4:21
out;
the problem of why some of us

14
4:23
eat too much and what we could
do to stop;

15
4:26
the question of why people go
crazy in groups;

16
4:30
research into whether you could
trust your childhood memories;

17
4:34
research into why some of us
get depressed and others don't.

18
4:38
The style of this is there'll
be two lectures a week,

19
4:43
as well as course readings.
Now, to do well in the course,

20
4:48
you have to attend both the
lectures and do the readings.

21
4:53
There will be some overlap.
In some cases,

22
4:55
the lectures will be quite
linked to the readings.

23
4:57
But there will be some parts of
the readings that will not find

24
5:00
their way into the lectures,
and some lectures--some entire

25
5:04
lectures that will not connect
at all to the readings.

26
5:07
So, to pursue this course
properly you have to do both.

27
5:12
What this means is that if you
miss a class you need to get

28
5:15
notes, and so you should get
them from a friend or from the

29
5:19
person sitting next to you.
The slides are going to be made

30
5:23
available online.
So, one of the things you don't

31
5:26
have to do is you don't have to
write this down.

32
5:28
You take notes any way you
choose, but if you don't get

33
5:31
anything on there it'll be
available online.

34
5:34
I'm going to post it in a
format which will be black and

35
5:37
white and easy to print out so
you don't have to worry about

36
5:40
this.
But again, attending to the

37
5:43
slides is not a substitute for
attending class.

38
5:47
There's a textbook,
Peter Gray's Psychology,

39
5:51
5th edition, and there's also a
collection of short readings,

40
5:55
The Norton Reader edited by
Gary Marcus.

41
5:59
It's an excellent textbook;
it's an excellent collection,

42
6:01
and you should get them both.
They're available at Labyrinth

43
6:05
bookstore on York Street or you
get them online.

44
6:09
I should note that last time I
taught the course I used the

45
6:12
Marcus Reader,
and when Professor Marvin Chun

46
6:15
taught his course last semester
he used Peter Gray's 5^(th)

47
6:18
edition textbook.
So, there may be a lot of used

48
6:21
copies floating around.
You should feel free to try to

49
6:24
get one of those.
The evaluation goes like this.

50
6:28
There is a Midterm and there is
a Final.

51
6:30
The Final will not be held in
the exam period,

52
6:33
because I like to take long
vacations.

53
6:35
It will be held the last day of
class.

54
6:38
The exams will be multiple
choice and short answer,

55
6:41
fill in the blank,
that sort of thing.

56
6:44
Prior to the exams I will post
previous exams online,

57
6:47
so you have a feeling for how
these exams work and so on.

58
6:52
There will also be review
sessions.

59
6:54
Starting at the beginning of
the third week of class – that

60
6:58
is not next week but the week
after – on each Monday I'm

61
7:01
going to put up a brief question
or set of questions,

62
7:05
which you have to answer and
your answers need to be sent to

63
7:08
your teaching fellow.
And you'll be given a teaching

64
7:12
fellow, assigned one,
by Friday.

65
7:14
This is not meant to be
difficult.

66
7:16
It's not meant to be more than
five, ten minutes of work,

67
7:19
but the point of the
question--15,20 minutes of work,

68
7:23
but the point of the question
is to motivate people to keep up

69
7:26
with the material and do the
readings.

70
7:29
These questions will be marked
pass, fail.

71
7:31
I expect most everybody could
pass all of the questions but

72
7:35
it's just to keep you on track
and keep you going.

73
7:38
There is a book review,
a short book review,

74
7:40
to be written towards near the
end of the class.

75
7:43
I'll give details about that
later on in the semester.

76
7:46
And there's also an
experimental participation

77
7:48
requirement, and next week I'll
hand out a piece of paper

78
7:51
describing the requirement.
The point of the requirement is

79
7:55
to give you all experience
actually seeing what

80
7:58
psychological research is about
as well as to give us hundreds

81
8:02
of subjects to do our
experiments on.

82
8:05
The issue sometimes comes up as
to how to do well in the course.

83
8:10
Here's how to do well.
Attend all the classes.

84
8:14
Keep up with the readings.
Ideally, keep up with the

85
8:18
readings before you come to
class.

86
8:21
And one thing I would strongly
suggest is to form some sort of

87
8:24
study groups,
either formally or informally.

88
8:27
Have people you could talk to
when the--prior to the exams

89
8:30
or--she's patting somebody next
to her.

90
8:33
I hope you know him.
And in fact,

91
8:39
what I'm going to do,
not this class because it's

92
8:42
shopping period.
I don't know who's coming next

93
8:44
class, or what but I'll set up a
few minutes prior,

94
8:47
at the beginning of the class,
for people just to introduce

95
8:51
themselves to the person next to
them so they have some sort of

96
8:55
resource in the class.
Now, this is a large class,

97
8:58
and if you don't do anything
about it, it can be very

98
9:02
anonymous.
And some of you may choose to

99
9:05
pursue it that way and that's
totally fine.

100
9:07
But what I would suggest you do
is establish some contact with

101
9:12
us, either with me or with any
of the teaching fellows,

102
9:15
and I'll introduce the teaching
fellows sometime next week.

103
9:19
You could talk to us at the
beginning or at the end of

104
9:22
class.
Unless there are special

105
9:24
circumstances,
I always try to come at least

106
9:26
ten minutes early,
and I am willing to stay late

107
9:29
to talk to people.
You could come by during my

108
9:31
office hours,
which are on the syllabus,

109
9:33
and you could send me e-mail
and set up an appointment.

110
9:36
I'm very willing to talk to
students about intellectual

111
9:39
ideas, about course problems and
so on.

112
9:41
And if you see me at some point
just on campus,

113
9:44
you could introduce yourself
and I'd like to meet people from

114
9:48
this class.
So, again, I want to stress you

115
9:51
have the option of staying
anonymous in this class,

116
9:54
but you also have the option of
seeking out and making some sort

117
9:58
of contact with us.
Okay.

118
10:01
That's the formal stuff of the
course.

119
10:03
What's this course about?
Unlike a lot of other courses,

120
10:08
some people come to Intro
Psychology with some unusual

121
10:12
motivations.
Maybe you're crazy and hope to

122
10:17
become less crazy.
Maybe you want to learn how to

123
10:21
study better,
improve your sex life,

124
10:24
interpret your dreams,
and win friends and influence

125
10:28
people.
Those are not necessarily bad

126
10:31
reasons to take this course and,
with the exception of the sex

127
10:36
part,
this course might actually help

128
10:38
you out with some of these
things.

129
10:40
The study of scientific
psychology has a lot of insights

130
10:43
of real world relevance to real
problems that we face in our

131
10:47
everyday lives.
And I'm going to try--and when

132
10:50
these issues come up--I'm going
to try to stress them and make

133
10:53
you try to think about the
extent to which the laboratory

134
10:56
research I'll be talking about
can affect your everyday life:

135
10:59
how you study,
how you interact with people,

136
11:01
how you might try to persuade
somebody of something else,

137
11:04
what sort of therapy works best
for you.

138
11:07
But the general goals of this
course are actually I think even

139
11:14
more interesting than that.
What I want to do is provide a

140
11:19
state of the art introduction to
the most important topic that

141
11:24
there is: us.
How the human mind works,

142
11:27
how we think,
what makes us what we are.

143
11:30
And we'll be approaching this
from a range of directions.

144
11:33
So, traditionally,
psychology is often broken up

145
11:36
into the following--into five
sub-areas: Neuroscience,

146
11:40
which is the study of the mind
by looking at the brain;

147
11:45
developmental,
which is the area which I focus

148
11:48
mostly on, which is trying to
learn about how people develop

149
11:52
and grow and learn;
cognitive, which is the one

150
11:55
term of the five that might be
unfamiliar to some of you,

151
11:59
but it refers to a sort of
computational approach to

152
12:02
studying the mind,
often viewing the mind on

153
12:05
analogy with a computer and
looking at how people do things

154
12:08
like understand language,
recognize objects,

155
12:12
play games, and so on.
There is social,

156
12:16
which is the study of how
people act in groups,

157
12:19
how people act with other
people.

158
12:21
And there is clinical,
which is maybe the aspect of

159
12:24
psychology that people think of
immediately when they hear

160
12:26
psychology,
which is the study of mental

161
12:29
health and mental illness.
And we'll be covering all of

162
12:32
those areas.
We'll also be covering a set of

163
12:34
related areas.
I am convinced that you cannot

164
12:37
study the mind solely by looking
at the discipline of psychology.

165
12:42
The discipline of psychology
spills over to issues of how the

166
12:46
mind has evolved.
Economics and game theory are

167
12:49
now essential tools for
understanding human thought and

168
12:53
human behavior--those issues
connecting to philosophy,

169
12:57
computer science,
anthropology,

170
12:59
literature, theology,
and many, many other domains.

171
13:02
So, this course will be wide
ranging in that sense.

172
13:08
At this point I've been
speaking in generalities so I

173
13:11
want to close this introductory
class by giving five examples of

174
13:16
the sorts of topics we'll be
covering.

175
13:19
And I'll start with the topic
that we'll be covering next week

176
13:24
on Monday – the brain.
This is a brain.

177
13:27
In fact, it's a specific
person's brain,

178
13:31
and what's interesting about
the brain is that little white

179
13:36
mark there.
It's her brain.

180
13:39
It's Terri Schiavo's brain.
You recognize her more from

181
13:43
pictures like that.
And what a case like this,

182
13:47
where somebody is in a coma,
is without consciousness as a

183
13:52
result of damage to the brain,
is a stark illustration of the

184
13:57
physical nature of mental life.
The physical basis for

185
14:00
everything that we normally hold
dear, like free will,

186
14:04
consciousness,
morality and emotions,

187
14:06
and that's what we'll begin the
course with,

188
14:09
talking about how a physical
thing can give rise to mental

189
14:16
life.
We'll talk a lot about children.

190
14:18
This is actually a specific
child.

191
14:21
It's my son,
Zachary, my younger son,

192
14:25
dressed up as Spider-Man,
but it is Halloween.

193
14:29
No, it's not Halloween.
Oh.

194
14:32
Well, there's more to say about
that [laughter].

195
14:36
I study child development for a
living and I'm interested in

196
14:40
several questions.
So, one question is just the

197
14:43
question of development.
Everybody in this room can

198
14:46
speak and understand English.
Everybody in this room has some

199
14:50
understanding of how the world
works, how physical things

200
14:53
behave.
Everybody in this room has some

201
14:56
understanding of other people,
and how people behave.

202
14:59
And the question that
preoccupies developmental

203
15:02
psychologists is how do we come
to have this knowledge,

204
15:06
and in particular,
how much of it is hard-wired,

205
15:10
built-in, innate.
And how much of it is the

206
15:14
product of culture,
of language,

207
15:17
of schooling?
And developmental psychologists

208
15:21
use many ingenious methods to
try to pull these apart and try

209
15:26
to figure out what are the basic
components of human nature.

210
15:31
There's also the question of
continuity.

211
15:35
To what extent is Zachary,
at that age,

212
15:40
going to be that way forever?
To what extent is your fate

213
15:45
sealed?
To what extent could--if I were

214
15:48
to meet you when you were five
years old I could describe the

215
15:53
way you are now?
The poet William Wordsworth

216
15:57
wrote, "The child is father to
the man," and what this means is

217
16:03
that you can see within every
child the adult he or she will

218
16:08
become.
We will look and ask the

219
16:12
question whether this is true.
Is it true for your personality?

220
16:16
Is it true for your interests?
Is it true for your

221
16:19
intelligence?
Another question having to do

222
16:24
with development is what makes
us the way we are?

223
16:29
We're different in a lot of
ways.

224
16:32
The people in this room differ
according to their taste in

225
16:35
food.
They differ according to their

226
16:37
IQs;
whether they're aggressive or

227
16:40
shy;
whether they're attracted to

228
16:42
males, females,
both or neither;

229
16:44
whether they are good at music;
whether they are politically

230
16:49
liberal or conservative.
Why are we different?

231
16:53
What's the explanation for why
we're different?

232
16:56
And again, this could be
translated in terms of a

233
16:59
question of genes and
environment.

234
17:01
To what extent are things the
result of the genes we possess?

235
17:05
To what extent are our
individual natures the result of

236
17:09
how we were raised?
And to what extent are they

237
17:12
best explained in terms of an
interaction?

238
17:15
One common theory,
for instance,

239
17:17
is that we are shaped by our
parents.

240
17:20
This was best summarized most
famously by the British poet

241
17:26
Philip Larkin who wrote,
They mess you up,

242
17:31
your mum and dad.
They may not mean to but they

243
17:36
do.
They fill you with the faults

244
17:38
they had
And add some extra just for

245
17:41
you.
Is he right?

246
17:44
It's very controversial.
You-- It's been a series of--a

247
17:47
huge controversy in the popular
culture to the extent of which

248
17:52
parents matter and this is an
issue which will preoccupy us

249
17:56
for much of the course.
A different question:

250
17:59
What makes somebody attractive?
And this can be asked at all

251
18:04
sorts of levels but a simple
level is what makes for a pretty

252
18:08
face?
So, these are,

253
18:10
according to ratings,
very attractive faces.

254
18:15
They are not the faces of real
people.

255
18:17
What's on the screen are
computer generated faces of a

256
18:21
Caucasian male and a Caucasian
female who don't exist in the

257
18:26
real world.
But through using this sort of

258
18:29
computer generation,
and then asking people what

259
18:32
they think of this face,
what they think of that face,

260
18:35
scientists have come to some
sense as to what really makes a

261
18:38
face attractive,
both within cultures and across

262
18:42
cultures.
And that's something which

263
18:44
we're going to devote some time
to when we talk about social

264
18:47
behavior, and in particular,
when we talk about sex.

265
18:51
Not all attractiveness,
not all beauty of course,

266
18:54
is linked to sex.
So, pandas for instance,

267
18:58
like this panda,
are notoriously cute,

268
19:01
and I don't have anything to
say about it really.

269
19:07
It's just a cute picture
[laughter].

270
19:12
Morality is extremely central
to our lives,

271
19:16
and a deep question,
which we will struggle with

272
19:19
throughout most of the course,
is the question of good and

273
19:24
evil, evil and good.
These three pictures exemplify

274
19:28
different sorts of evil.
What you could call

275
19:31
institutional evil by somebody
behaving cruelly toward somebody

276
19:37
else,
perhaps not due to malice but

277
19:40
because of the situation that
she's in.

278
19:43
It has picture of Osama bin
Laden, a mass murderer or driven

279
19:46
by political cause?
And then there's this guy on

280
19:49
the bottom.
Anybody know who he is?

281
19:51


282
19:55
Ted Bundy.
Who got that?

283
19:57
Film that man [laughter].
No.

284
19:59
Ted Bundy, exactly,
and that's before we get into

285
20:03
the technical stuff like
crazy-evil,

286
20:06
and we're going to have to come
to terms with why some people

287
20:12
are like that.
And again, the same situation

288
20:15
comes up.
Is it part of your nature to be

289
20:19
good or bad or is it largely due
to the situation that you fall

290
20:26
in?
And there's a lot of some quite

291
20:29
spectacular experiments that try
to tease that apart.

292
20:32
If we're going to talk about
evil, we should also talk about

293
20:37
good.
These are pictures of two

294
20:41
notoriously good men,
Oskar Schindler and Paul

295
20:47
Rusesabagina,
each who at different times in

296
20:52
history saved the lives of many,
many people at great risk to

297
20:57
themselves.
Schindler in the Holocaust,

298
21:01
and then the other guy,
in – and I can't pronounce

299
21:06
his name – Rusesabagina,
in Rwanda.

300
21:10
And they both had real good
movies made about them.

301
21:15
But what's interesting with
these cases is you couldn't have

302
21:19
predicted ahead of time that
they would be heroes.

303
21:23
And one personal issue within
any of us is what would we do in

304
21:28
such situations?
Finally, throughout this course

305
21:33
we will discuss mental illness.
Now, towards the end of the

306
21:39
class I want to devote a full
week to discussing major

307
21:42
disorders like depression and
anxiety,

308
21:45
because of their profound
social importance.

309
21:49
Such disorders are reasonably
common in college students.

310
21:53
Many people in this room are
currently suffering from a mood

311
21:57
disorder, an anxiety disorder or
both,

312
22:00
and I won't ask for a show of
hands but I know a lot of people

313
22:04
in this room are on some form of
medication for this disorder.

314
22:09
And we'll discuss the current
research and why people get

315
22:13
these disorders and what's the
best way to make them better.

316
22:17
But I also have a weakness for
the less common mental disorders

317
22:22
that I think tell us something
really interesting about mental

318
22:26
life.
So, when we talk about memory,

319
22:29
for instance,
we'll talk about disorders in

320
22:31
memory,
including some disorders that

321
22:34
keep you from forming new
memories as well as disorders of

322
22:38
amnesia where you forget the
past.

323
22:40
And these are extraordinarily
interesting for all sorts of

324
22:45
reasons.
Early in the course,

325
22:47
in fact I think next week,
we will discuss,

326
22:50
no, later on in the course,
in the middle of the semester,

327
22:53
we will discuss an amazing case
of Phineas Gage.

328
22:57
Phineas Gage was a construction
worker about 100 years ago.

329
23:01
Due to an explosion,
a metal pipe went through his

330
23:05
head like so.
Miraculously, he was not killed.

331
23:10
In fact, his friends--it went
through his head,

332
23:13
went--ended up 100 feet away,
covered with brains and blood.

333
23:17
And Phineas Gage sat down and
went, "uh, oh."

334
23:20
And then on the way to the
hospital they stopped by a pub

335
23:24
to have some cider.
He was not blind,

336
23:28
he was not deaf,
he was not retarded,

337
23:33
but something else happened to
him.

338
23:37
He lost his sense of right and
wrong.

339
23:40
He lost his control.
He used to be a hard-working

340
23:46
family man.
After the accident he lost all

341
23:49
of that.
He couldn't hold a job.

342
23:51
He couldn't stay faithful to
his wife.

343
23:53
He couldn't speak for five
minutes without cursing.

344
23:57
He got into fights.
He got into brawls.

345
23:59
He got drunk.
He lost his control.

346
24:01
He ended up on a circus
sideshow traveling through the

347
24:05
country with the big steel pipe
that went through his head.

348
24:09
And this is again an
extraordinary example of how the

349
24:13
brain can give rise to the mind,
and how things that go wrong

350
24:18
with the brain can affect you in
a serious way.

351
24:21
We'll discuss cases of multiple
personality disorder,

352
24:24
where people have more than one
personality.

353
24:27
And also, discuss the debate
over whether such cases are true

354
24:31
or not;
whether they could be taken as

355
24:33
a real phenomena or a made-up
phenomena, which is--there is a

356
24:36
matter of a lot of controversy.
And then, we'll even discuss

357
24:41
some rarer cases like Capgras
syndrome.

358
24:45
Capgras syndrome is typically
– there's hundreds of cases,

359
24:50
not many – hundreds of cases.
It's typically the result of

360
24:54
some sort of stroke,
and what happens to you is very

361
24:57
specific.
You develop a particular

362
25:01
delusion, like it's getting dark
.

363
25:07
And the delusion is that the
people you love the most have

364
25:14
been replaced.
They've been replaced by aliens

365
25:19
or robots – thank you – by
Martians, by CIA agents,

366
25:23
by trained actors and
actresses.

367
25:27
But the people--But the idea
is, the people you care for the

368
25:33
most you believe are gone.
And this could lead to tragic

369
25:39
consequences.
Capgras syndrome is associated

370
25:42
with a very high level of
violence.

371
25:45
One man in Australia a couple
of years ago was under the

372
25:49
delusion that his father was
replaced with a robot and cut

373
25:53
off his head.
A related disorder involving

374
25:57
the very same parts of the brain
is called Cotard's syndrome.

375
26:02
And Cotard's syndrome is you
believe that you're dead;

376
26:07
you are persuaded that you're
dead.

377
26:10
You're walking around.
You know you're walking around.

378
26:11
And you know that there are
people around,

379
26:13
but you think that you're dead.
And what's striking about these

380
26:17
is--it's not--these are not just
sort of big, screwy problems of

381
26:21
messed up people.
Rather, they're

382
26:23
located--they're related at a
pinpoint level to certain parts

383
26:27
of your brain.
And we're going to talk about

384
26:30
the best modern theories as to
why these syndromes occur.

385
26:34
Now, the reason to be
interested in them,

386
26:36
again, is not because they're
frequent.

387
26:39
They aren't.
And it's not because of some

388
26:42
sort of gruesome,
morbid curiosity.

389
26:44
Rather, by looking at extreme
cases, they can help us best

390
26:51
understand normal life.
Often by looking at extremes it

391
26:56
throws into sharp contrast
things we naturally take for

392
26:59
granted.
The issue of psychopathy,

393
27:01
of people who,
either due to brain damage or

394
27:04
because they are born that way,
have no moral understanding,

395
27:08
can help us cope with questions
of free will and responsibility;

396
27:12
of the relationship or
difference between mental

397
27:15
illness and evil.
Multiple personality cases

398
27:17
force us to address the question
of what is a self.

399
27:21
To what extent are all of us
composed of multiple people,

400
27:25
and to what extent are we a
single unified person over time?

401
27:30
Cases like Capgras are
important because they tell us

402
27:34
about how we see the world.
They tell us for instance that

403
27:38
there is a difference between
recognizing something in the

404
27:41
sense that you could name it,
and knowing what it is.

405
27:44
And so, by studying these
abnormal cases we could get some

406
27:49
insight into regular life.
So, that's the end of the

407
27:53
illustration of the example
topics.

408
27:55
The syllabus lists many more.
I'll end by telling you that

409
28:00
there's a lot of stuff that
we'll be talking about,

410
28:05
that I want to talk about,
that I am not expert in.

411
28:10
And fortunately,
there is a community at Yale of

412
28:14
the best scholars and teachers
on the planet.

413
28:18
And so, it would be a shame for
me not to use them to cover some

414
28:21
of these issues.
And so, I'm going to include

415
28:25
four guest lecturers.
The first one is Dr.

416
28:29
Marvin Chun who teaches the
Introduction to Psychology

417
28:33
course in the fall and is my
competition.

418
28:37
And he's going to give an
amazing lecture on cognitive

419
28:40
neuroscience,
especially the cognitive

420
28:42
neuroscience of faces.

421
28:44


422
28:47
Dr.
Susan Nolen-Hoeksema is the

423
28:49
world's authority on depression,
and in particular,

424
28:53
on sex differences and
depression, and she's going to

425
28:56
talk about this towards the end
of the course.

426
28:58
Kelly Brownell is going to
talk--is head of the Rudd

427
29:05
Center, focuses on obesity,
eating disorders,

428
29:09
dieting, and he'll talk about
the psychology of food.

429
29:12
And finally,
Dr.

430
29:14
Peter Salovey,
Dean of Yale College,

431
29:18
is going to come to us on
Valentine's Day and tell us

432
29:24
everything he knows about the
mysteries of love.

433
29:30
All of these details are in the
syllabus and I'll stick around

434
29:33
and answer questions.
Hope to see you next week.

435
29:37
