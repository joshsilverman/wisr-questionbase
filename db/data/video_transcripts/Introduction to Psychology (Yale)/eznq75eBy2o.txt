Professor Paul Bloom:
So, most of what we do these

2
0:14
days – our methods,
our theories,

3
0:16
our ideas – are shaped,
to some extent,

4
0:17
by Piaget's influence.
And so, what I want to do is

5
0:21
begin this class that's going to
talk about cognitive development

6
0:25
by talking about his ideas.
His idea was that children are

7
0:29
active thinkers;
they're trying to figure out

8
0:32
the world.
He often described them as

9
0:34
little scientists.
And incidentally,

10
0:37
to know where he's coming from
on this, he had a very dramatic

11
0:44
and ambitious goal.
He didn't start off because he

12
0:48
was interested in children.
He started off because he was

13
0:51
interested in the emergence of
knowledge in general.

14
0:54
It was a discipline he
described as genetic

15
0:57
epistemology – the origins of
knowledge.

16
1:01
But he studied development of
the individual child because he

17
1:04
was convinced that this
development will tell him about

18
1:07
the development of knowledge
more generally.

19
1:10
There's a very snooty phrase
that--I don't know if you ever

20
1:13
heard it before.
It's a great phrase.

21
1:15
It's "Ontogeny recapitulates
phylogeny."

22
1:19
And the idea of this--What that
means is that development of an

23
1:23
individual mimics or repeats
development of the species.

24
1:28
Now, it's entirely not true,
but it's a beautiful phrase and

25
1:32
Piaget was committed to this.
He was very interested in

26
1:35
saying, "Look.
We'll figure how a kid develops

27
1:37
and that will tell us about the
development of knowledge more

28
1:41
generally."
So, Piaget viewed the child as

29
1:44
a scientist who developed this
understanding,

30
1:47
these schemas,
these little,

31
1:49
miniature theories of the
world.

32
1:52
And they did this through two
sorts of mechanisms:

33
1:56
assimilation and accommodation.
So, assimilation would be the

34
2:01
act of expanding the range of
things that you respond to.

35
2:06
Piaget's example would be a
baby who's used to sucking on a

36
2:10
breast might come to suck on a
bottle or on a rattle.

37
2:14
That's changing the scope of
things that you respond to.

38
2:19
Accommodation is changing how
you do it.

39
2:23
A baby will form his mouth
differently depending on what

40
2:26
he's sucking on.
And so, these processes where

41
2:29
you take in--I'm giving this in
a very physical way,

42
2:34
but in a more psychological
sense you have a way of looking

43
2:36
at the world.
You could expand it to

44
2:38
encompass new things,
assimilation.

45
2:41
But you could also change your
system of knowledge itself –

46
2:45
accommodation.
And Piaget argued that these

47
2:48
two mechanisms of learning drove
the child through different

48
2:52
stages.
And he had a stage theory,

49
2:55
which was quite different from
the Freudian stage theory that

50
2:58
we have been introduced to.
So his methods were to ask

51
3:02
children to solve problems and
to ask them questions.

52
3:07
And his discoveries that--they
did them in different ways at

53
3:10
different ages led to the
emergence of the Stage Theory.

54
3:14
So, for Piaget,
the first stage is the

55
3:19
sensorimotor stage or the
sensorimotor period.

56
3:24
For here the child is purely a
physical creature.

57
3:31
The child has no understanding
in any real way of the external

58
3:35
world.
There's no understanding of the

59
3:38
past, no understanding of the
future, no stability,

60
3:41
no differentiation.
The child just touches and

61
3:45
sees, but doesn't yet reason.

62
3:48


63
3:52
And it's through this stage
that a child gradually comes to

64
3:56
acquire object permanence.

65
3:57


66
4:00
Object permanence is the
understanding that things exist

67
4:05
when you no longer see them.
So those of you in front,

68
4:09
you're looking at me and I go.
It occurred to me it'd be a

69
4:14
great magic trick if I then
appeared in back.

70
4:16
But no, I'm just here.
That's object permanence.

71
4:19
If I went under here and then
the people said,

72
4:23
"Where the hell did he go?
Class is over," that would show

73
4:27
a lack of object permanence.
So, adults have object

74
4:31
permanence.
Piaget's very interesting claim

75
4:35
is that kids don't.
Before six-month-olds,

76
4:39
Piaget observed,
you take an object the kid

77
4:42
likes like a rattle,
you hide it,

78
4:44
you put it behind something,
it's like it's gone.

79
4:48
And he claimed the child really
thinks it's just gone.

80
4:52
Things don't continue to exist
when I'm not looking at them

81
4:55
anymore.
And so he noticed they--they're

82
4:58
surprised by peek-a-boo.
And Piaget's claim was one

83
5:01
reason why they're surprised at
peek-a-boo is you go--you look

84
5:04
at a kid,
the kid's smiling and go,

85
5:06
"Oh, peek-a-boo," and you
close--and you cover your face

86
5:08
and the kid says,
"He's gone."

87
5:10
"Peek-a-boo."
"Oh, there he is.

88
5:13
He's gone."
And you really--That's the

89
5:17
claim.
Piaget also discovered that

90
5:20
older children fail at a task
that's known as the A-not-B

91
5:25
task.
And Peter Gray in his

92
5:27
psychology textbook refers to it
as the "changing hiding places"

93
5:31
problem, which is probably a
better name for it.

94
5:35
And here's the idea.
You take a nine-month-old and

95
5:38
for Piaget a nine-month-old is
just starting to make sense of

96
5:41
objects and their permanence.
You take an object and you put

97
5:46
it here in a cup where the kid
can't see it,

98
5:49
but it's in the cup.
So the kid, if you were the

99
5:52
kid, will reach for it.
You do it again, reach for it.

100
5:55
You do it again, reach for it.
That's point A.

101
5:57
Then you take--you move it over
here.

102
6:01
Piaget observed kids would
still reach for this.

103
6:03
It's like they're not smart
enough to figure out that it's

104
6:06
not there anymore,
even if they see it move.

105
6:09
And this was more evidence that
they just don't understand

106
6:13
objects, and that this thing
takes a lot of time and learning

107
6:17
to develop.
The next stage is the

108
6:20
preoperational stage.
The child starts off grasping

109
6:24
the world only in a physical
way, in a sensorimotor way,

110
6:29
but when he gets to the
preoperational period the

111
6:31
capacity to represent the world,
to have the world inside your

112
6:36
head, comes into being.
But it's limited and it's

113
6:40
limited in a couple of striking
ways.

114
6:43
One way in which it's limited
is that children are egocentric.

115
6:48
Now, egocentrism has a meaning
in common English which means to

116
6:53
be selfish.
Piaget meant it in a more

117
6:55
technical way.
He claimed that children at

118
6:58
this age literally can't
understand that others can see

119
7:01
the world differently from them.
So, one of his demonstrations

120
7:06
was the three mountains task.
We have three mountains over

121
7:09
there.
You put a child on one side of

122
7:11
the mountains and you ask him to
draw it, and a four- or

123
7:15
five-year-old can do it easily,
but then you ask him to draw it

124
7:19
as it would appear from the
other side and children find

125
7:23
this extraordinarily difficult.
They find it very difficult to

126
7:27
grasp the world as another
person might see it.

127
7:31
Another significant finding
Piaget had about this phase of

128
7:36
development concerns what's
called "conservation."

129
7:41
The notion of conservation is
that there's ways to transform

130
7:46
things such that some aspects of
them change but others remain

131
7:51
the same.
So, for instance,

132
7:54
if you take a glass of water
and you pour it into another

133
7:59
glass that's shallow or tall,
it won't change the amount of

134
8:04
water you have.
If you take a bunch of pennies

135
8:06
and you spread them out,
you don't get more pennies.

136
8:09
But kids, according to Piaget,
don't know that and this is one

137
8:12
of the real cool demonstrations.
Any of you who have access to a

138
8:16
four- or five-year-old,
[laughter]

139
8:18
a sibling or something--Do not
take one without permission,

140
8:21
but if you have access to a
four- or five-year-old you can

141
8:24
do this yourself.
This is what it looks like.

142
8:26
The first one has no sound.
The second one is going to be

143
8:29
sound that's going to come on at
the end.

144
8:31
But there's two rows of
checkers.

145
8:33
She asks the kid which one has
more.

146
8:37
The kid says they're the same.
Then she says--Now she asks him

147
8:43
which one has more,
that or that.

148
8:47
So that's really stupid.
And it's an amazing finding

149
8:51
kids will do that and it's a
robust finding.

150
8:55
Here's another example.
So, they're the same.

151
8:58


152
9:07
So, it's a cool finding of that
stage, suggesting a limitation

153
9:11
in how you deal and make sense
of the world.

154
9:15
The next phase,
concrete operations,

155
9:17
from seven to twelve,
you can solve the conservation

156
9:20
problem,
but still you're limited to the

157
9:23
extent you're capable of
abstract reasoning.

158
9:26
So the mathematical notions of
infinity or logical notions like

159
9:31
logical entailment are beyond a
child of this age.

160
9:34
The child is able to do a lot,
but still it's to some extent

161
9:38
stuck in the concrete world.
And then finally,

162
9:41
at around age twelve,
you could get abstract and

163
9:45
scientific reasoning.
And this is the Piagetian

164
9:50
theory in very brief form.
Now, Piaget fared a lot better

165
9:56
than did Freud or Skinner for
several reasons.

166
10:02
One reason is these are
interesting and falsifiable

167
10:05
claims about child development.
So claims that--about the

168
10:08
failure of conservation in
children at different ages could

169
10:12
be easily tested and
systematically tested,

170
10:15
and in fact,
there's a lot of support for

171
10:18
them.
Piaget had a rich theoretical

172
10:20
framework, pulling together all
sorts of observations in

173
10:23
different ways,
wrote many, many books and

174
10:25
articles and articulated his
theory very richly.

175
10:28
And most of all,
I think, he had some really

176
10:30
striking findings.
Before Piaget,

177
10:32
nobody noticed these
conservation findings.

178
10:35
Before Piaget,
nobody noticed that babies had

179
10:38
this problem tracking and
understanding objects.

180
10:41
At the same time,
however, there are limitations

181
10:44
in Piaget's theory.
Some of these limitations are

182
10:49
theoretical.
It's an interesting question as

183
10:52
to whether he really explains
how a child goes from a concrete

184
10:55
thinker to an abstract thinker,
or how he goes from not having

185
10:59
object permanence to
understanding object permanence.

186
11:02
There's methodological
limitations.

187
11:05
Piaget was really big into
question and answer,

188
11:08
but one problem with this is
that children aren't very good

189
11:11
with language,
and this might lead you to

190
11:13
underestimate how much they
know.

191
11:16
And this is particularly a
problem the younger you get.

192
11:20
Methodology is going to loom
heavy in the discussion of any

193
11:24
science and that includes
psychology.

194
11:27
Often 90% of the game is
discovering a clever method

195
11:32
through which to test your
hypotheses.

196
11:35
We're going to talk a little
bit about that regarding babies.

197
11:38
I'll give you another example
from a very different domain.

198
11:41
There was a set of scientists
interested in studying tickling.

199
11:45
So, when you tickle somebody,
under what circumstances will

200
11:49
they laugh?
Where do you have to tickle

201
11:51
them?
Can you tickle yourself?

202
11:52
Does it have to be a surprise,
and so on?

203
11:55
It turns out very difficult to
study this in a lab.

204
11:58
You're not going to have your
experimental credit.

205
11:59
You come into the lab and say,
"Okay.

206
12:00
I'm the graduate student.
Ha, ha, ha."

207
12:03
And [laughter]
in fact, an example of a

208
12:05
methodological attempt was done
by Henry Gleitman at University

209
12:08
of Pennsylvania,
who built a tickle machine,

210
12:11
which was this box with these
two giant hands that went

211
12:15
"r-r-r-r."
This was a failure because

212
12:17
people could not go near the
tickle machine without

213
12:20
convulsing in laughter.
But we will discuss when we

214
12:24
have a lecture on laughter a bit
of the tickle sciences.

215
12:29
And finally there's factual.
What do infants and children

216
12:33
really know?
It's possible that due to the

217
12:36
methodological limitations of
Piaget, he systematically

218
12:40
underestimated what children and
babies know.

219
12:44
And in fact,
I'll present some evidence

220
12:46
suggesting that this is in
fact--that this is the case.

221
12:49
So, I want to introduce you to
the modern science of infant

222
12:54
cognition.
Infant cognition has been

223
12:57
something studied for a very
long time.

224
12:59
And there was a certain view
that has had behind it a

225
13:03
tremendous philosophical and
psychological consensus.

226
13:07
And it's summarized in this
Onion headline here.

227
13:11
And the idea is that babies are
stupid, that babies really don't

228
13:17
know much about the world.
Now, the work that this

229
13:20
Onion headline is
satirizing is the recent

230
13:23
studies,
which I'm going to talk about,

231
13:26
suggested that on the contrary,
babies might be smarter than

232
13:29
you think.
And to discover the

233
13:31
intelligence of babies we have
to ourselves be pretty smart in

234
13:35
developing different techniques.
To study what a baby knows,

235
13:39
you can't ask your questions.
Babies can't talk.

236
13:43
You could look at what it does
but babies are not very

237
13:46
coordinated or skilled so you
need to use clever methods.

238
13:50
One clever method is to look at
their brain waves [laughter].

239
13:55
This child on the right died
during testing.

240
13:58
It was a tragic--It was crushed
by the weights [laughter]

241
14:01
of the electrodes.
He's happy though.

242
14:03
You could study their brain
waves.

243
14:06
One of the few things babies
can do is they could suck on a

244
14:09
pacifier.
And you might think,

245
14:10
well, how could you learn
anything from that?

246
14:12
Well, for instance,
you could build machines that

247
14:15
when babies suck on a pacifier
they hear music or they hear

248
14:18
language,
and then you could look at how

249
14:21
much they suck on the pacifier
to determine what they like.

250
14:25
But undeniably we know most of
our--we got most of our

251
14:29
knowledge about babies from
studies of their looking times.

252
14:35
That's one thing babies can do.
They can look.

253
14:39
And I have up here--This is a
picture of Elizabeth Spelke,

254
14:42
who is a developmental
psychologist who's developed the

255
14:45
most research on looking at
babies' looking times and what

256
14:49
you could learn from them.
And I have here two ways you

257
14:52
could learn from looking.
One is preference.

258
14:55
So for instance,
suppose you want to know,

259
14:58
for whatever reason,
do babies like the looks of

260
15:00
dogs or cats?
Well, you could put a baby

261
15:03
down, have a picture of a dog
here, a picture of a cat here,

262
15:08
and see which one the baby
looks at.

263
15:11
Babies can move their eyes and
that could tell you something.

264
15:14
Do babies distinguish pretty
faces from ugly faces?

265
15:18
Well, put a pretty face here,
an ugly face here,

266
15:20
see if the baby prefers to look
at the pretty one.

267
15:23
You could also do habituation
and surprise.

268
15:28
And much of the studies I'm
going to talk about here involve

269
15:31
habituation and surprise.
Habituation is a fancy word for

270
15:35
boredom.
What you do is you show a baby

271
15:38
something over and over again.
Now, remember from behaviorism

272
15:42
the baby will learn this isn't
very interesting.

273
15:45
Then you show the baby
something different.

274
15:48
If the baby really sees it as
different, the baby will look

275
15:52
longer, and you could use that
as a measure of what babies find

276
15:56
different.
For instance,

277
15:57
suppose you want to know if the
baby can tell green from red.

278
16:00
Well, you could show the baby a
green patch, a green patch,

279
16:03
a green patch,
a green patch;

280
16:04
the baby'll get bored,
then a red patch.

281
16:07
If they all look the same to
the baby, the baby will just

282
16:10
continue to tune out,
but if the red looks different

283
16:13
the baby will perk up.
And this is,

284
16:16
in fact, one way they study
color vision in babies.

285
16:20
Surprise is related to this.
You could show babies something

286
16:25
that shouldn't happen.
If babies are like--If babies

287
16:28
also think it shouldn't happen,
they might look longer,

288
16:32
and essentially what happens is
scientists do magic tricks to

289
16:36
explore this very thing.
And to start with some real

290
16:39
examples, a lot of this infant
research has gone back to the

291
16:43
Piagetian question of object
permanence,

292
16:46
asking, "Is it really true
babies don't know that objects

293
16:51
remain even when they're out of
sight?"

294
16:54
So one very simple study by
Spelke and Baillargeon:

295
16:59
Have babies shown a block with
a bar going back and forth like

296
17:04
that.
So the bar just goes back and

297
17:07
forth.
Now, there's something you do

298
17:09
that's so obvious you probably
don't even know you're doing it.

299
17:13
When you see a display like
that, what you assume is there's

300
17:15
a bar there, and what that means
is there's something in the

301
17:18
middle that you've never seen
before.

302
17:20
But of course,
if you were a simple perceptual

303
17:23
creature, you would just see
that there'd be a bar on top and

304
17:27
a bar on the bottom.
You wouldn't expect anything in

305
17:29
the middle because you never saw
anything in the middle.

306
17:31
So, what you do then is you
show babies this and then you

307
17:35
show them either B or C and if
we do this with adults you

308
17:39
expect B, C is almost a joke.
And, in fact,

309
17:42
babies respond the same way.
Babies expect there to be an

310
17:46
entire, complete bar and are
surprised and look longer at the

311
17:50
broken bar.
Other studies,

312
17:52
some of them--Well,
here's another study by Rene

313
17:55
Baillargeon looking at the same
thing in a different way.

314
17:59
You show the baby,
say a six-month-old,

315
18:03
a stage with a block on it.
Then a screen rises and

316
18:08
obscures the block.
Now, if the babies expect the

317
18:12
block to still be there,
they should think the block

318
18:16
should stop the screen.
On the other hand,

319
18:19
if out of sight out of mind,
they should expect the screen

320
18:22
to keep going.
So, what you do is you set up a

321
18:25
couple of displays,
one where the block is stopped,

322
18:28
the other one where you take
this away with a trap door and

323
18:31
it keeps going.
And, as you see,

324
18:34
the baby screams when this
happens.

325
18:36
That doesn't really happen,
but they do look longer.

326
18:41
One final example of an object
permanence study.

327
18:44
Some of this work's been done
at Yale in Karen Wynn's lab,

328
18:48
where they look at babies'
understanding of addition and

329
18:51
subtraction.
And a lot of it is done with

330
18:54
real objects,
but there's also animated

331
18:55
versions so here is an animated
example.

332
18:58


333
19:21
Babies are surprised.
They expect 2 - 1 = 1 and when

334
19:27
2 - 1 = 2 or 3 or 0,
they look longer,

335
19:31
indicating surprise.
And even six-month-olds are

336
19:35
sensitive to these rudimentary
facts of arithmetic,

337
19:38
telling us something about
their mathematical knowledge,

338
19:41
but also telling us something
about that they expect things to

339
19:44
remain when they're out of
sight.

340
19:45
Now, this research suggests
that infants' understanding of

341
19:50
the physical world is there from
the very start,

342
19:54
but at the same time not
entirely.

343
19:57
We know there are certain
things babies don't know.

344
20:00
Here's an example.
Suppose you show babies this.

345
20:04
You have a block here and then
you have something above there

346
20:07
floating in mid air.
Babies find this surprising.

347
20:11
Even six-month-olds find this
surprising.

348
20:14
It violates gravity,
but six-month-olds aren't smart

349
20:18
enough to know that a block just
stuck over here is also

350
20:22
surprising.
Twelve-month-olds will think

351
20:25
that it should fall.
Six-month-olds don't,

352
20:27
and even 12-month-olds don't
find anything weird about this,

353
20:31
while adults are sophisticated
enough to understand that that's

354
20:36
an unstable configuration and
should fall over.

355
20:39
So, although some things are
built in, some things develop.

356
20:44
And this raises the question
of, "How do we explain

357
20:47
development?"
How do we explain when babies

358
20:50
come to know things that they
didn't originally know?

359
20:54
Well, one answer is neural
maturation, growth of the brain.

360
21:00
Most of the neurons you have
now in your head,

361
21:04
right now, you had when you
were in your mother's uterus.

362
21:09
What happens in development
isn't for the most part the

363
21:12
growth of new neurons.
It's for the most part pruning,

364
21:15
getting rid of neurons.
So, the neural structures

365
21:18
change radically as babies kind
of get rid of excess neurons

366
21:22
through development.
At the same time though,

367
21:25
connections between neurons
grow like crazy and they--and

368
21:29
this process of synaptic growth
where there are the connections

369
21:34
across different synapses peaks
at about two years.

370
21:38
Finally, remember myelination,
where you sort of get this

371
21:41
fatty sheath over your neuron to
make it more effective?

372
21:44
That also happens through
development, and in fact,

373
21:47
it goes through development and
even teenagers are not fully

374
21:51
myelinated.
In particular,

375
21:53
they're not fully myelinated in
their frontal lobes.

376
21:56
Recall that frontal lobes are
involved in things like

377
22:00
restraint and willpower.
And so, it could be the problem

378
22:04
is the baby's brain doesn't
develop yet.

379
22:07
Another possibility is there's
problems with inhibition.

380
22:12
This is related,
again, to the frontal lobes and

381
22:15
this comes out with the A,
not B error.

382
22:18
So, remember the baby reaches,
reaches, reaches.

383
22:22
It's moved, reach,
follow, keeps reaching the same

384
22:27
place.
And it could be that babies

385
22:29
don't know anything about
objects.

386
22:30
But another possibility is once
you do something it's kind of

387
22:33
hard to stop.
It takes a bit of control to

388
22:36
stop.
And there's all sorts of

389
22:38
independent evidence that babies
lack this control.

390
22:40
The part of their brain that
could control certain behaviors

391
22:45
is just not active yet.
There's a very nice

392
22:49
illustration of inhibitory
problems from a "Simpsons"

393
22:52
episode that actually sort of
covers anything you might want

394
22:55
to know about developmental
differences.

395
22:58


396
23:01
And that basically may sum up
much of developmental

397
23:04
psychology.
That the child essentially--he

398
23:08
does A, A, A.
It's moved.

399
23:10
You go, "doh!"
and he keeps going for it.

400
23:13
And there's some evidence
that's true.

401
23:15
Adele Diamond who studies this
finds that although kids reach

402
23:19
for A, they look for B,
as if they know it's there but

403
23:23
they can't stop themselves from
reaching.

404
23:26
And we'll continue this theme a
little bit later.

405
23:28
Finally, it might be kids don't
know things.

406
23:32
Some things you've got to learn.
And this is true in all sorts

407
23:36
of domains – in the social
world, in the economic world,

408
23:40
in the political world – and
it's true as well in the

409
23:43
physical world.
In fact, there's some things

410
23:45
even adults don't know.
So, here's a study by Michael

411
23:49
McCloskey with college students.
Here's the idea.

412
23:54
You have a tube,
a transparent--a tube--a hollow

413
23:58
tube, and at the top of the tube
you throw a ball through so it

414
24:03
whips through the tube and it
comes out.

415
24:07
The question is,
"What happens to it?"

416
24:09
Does it go in the path of A,
or does it go in the path of B?

417
24:15
Without looking around,
who votes for A?

418
24:18
Who votes for B?
Here's the weird thing.

419
24:22
Whenever I do this at Yale
everybody gets the damn thing

420
24:26
right [laughter].
At Johns Hopkins,

421
24:29
50/50, [laughter]
for A and B.

422
24:33
I got to get a better demo.
But anyway, college students

423
24:37
not here, show systematic biases
of incorrect physical

424
24:42
intuitions.
Here's a twist,

425
24:45
and if you found people who
were less wonderful than you

426
24:49
all, and asked them you'd get a
lot of people saying the curving

427
24:53
thing.
But here's a twist.

428
24:55
Ask somebody,
"What if you took a tube and

429
24:58
you squirted water through it?
Where would the water go?"

430
25:02
Nobody chooses B.
Everybody knows the water would

431
25:05
continue in a straight line,
suggesting that when you have

432
25:08
experience that helps you out,
but in absence of experience

433
25:12
you're kind of lost.
We've talked about the physical

434
25:16
world.
What about the social world?

435
25:18
What about the world of people?
Well, there's a lot of research

436
25:21
on this as well.
Babies start off with some

437
25:24
social preferences.
If you take newborn

438
25:26
babies--It's very hard to do
research with newborn babies

439
25:30
actually because of the consent
procedure and everything,

440
25:33
so most of this work is done in
France [laughter],

441
25:37
where they have no laws at all.
They just rush in to--Women

442
25:40
give birth and they rush in and
they say, "We are

443
25:42
psychologists,"
and then we do experiments on

444
25:44
the babies, and it's terrific.
And this is one of them where

445
25:49
they compare babies looking at
this versus this.

446
25:54
Babies like the one that looks
like a face.

447
25:57
These are newborns.
There are some preferences with

448
26:01
humans and with other primates
to favor faces.

449
26:04
Babies are also social animals
too, so they're natural mimics.

450
26:08
Andrew Meltzoff,
for instance,

451
26:10
has found that if you go to a
newborn baby,

452
26:13
and if you find a newborn baby,
this is the first thing you

453
26:16
should do.
Stick your face right up to the

454
26:19
newborn baby and go like this
and stick your tongue out.

455
26:23
And Meltzoff finds that babies
more often than not stick their

456
26:28
tongues out back,
suggesting some sort of social

457
26:31
connection from one person to
another, and then later on

458
26:34
babies are mimics.
Babies more often than not will

459
26:38
copy the face next to them.
Now, these--the nature of these

460
26:42
responses, this preferring
faces, this sort of mimicry,

461
26:47
is a matter of debate,
and there's a lot of research

462
26:49
going on asking how smart are
babies.

463
26:51
Can we see--use some of the
same methods that we've looked

464
26:55
at for the physical world to
look at the social world?

465
26:59
And to illustrate one of the
studies, I'll tell you about a

466
27:02
study that I did with Valerie
Kuhlmeier and Karen Wynn.

467
27:06
And so, what we tested was
nine-month-olds and

468
27:08
twelve-month-olds,
and we showed them movies.

469
27:11
So, they're sitting down and
they're seeing a movie where one

470
27:14
character's going to help a ball
achieve a goal,

471
27:16
and another character's going
to hinder the ball.

472
27:18
And then we're going to see
whether they expect the ball to

473
27:22
approach the one that helped it
versus the one that hindered it.

474
27:26
So, this is what a baby would
see.

475
27:30
This is literally the same
movie a baby would see in the

476
27:32
experiment.
The thing is for these sorts of

477
27:35
experiments there is a lot of
control, so something that's a

478
27:38
square in one movie will be a
triangle in another movie;

479
27:41
something that's on the top in
one movie will be on the bottom

480
27:44
in another movie.
So, this is an example movie

481
27:46
but this is what babies would
see.

482
27:48


483
28:04
And they'd see this over and
over again and the question is

484
28:08
would they expect babies--would
babies expect the one to

485
28:11
approach the one that helped it
or approach the one that

486
28:15
hindered it?
And what we find is,

487
28:17
statistically,
babies look longer when shown a

488
28:20
movie where it approaches the
one that hindered it versus

489
28:23
helped it.
And this we take as preliminary

490
28:26
evidence that they have a social
interpretation.

491
28:31
They see this movie as you see
this movie in terms of helping

492
28:34
and hindering,
and somebody going to somebody

493
28:36
that helped it versus hindered
it.

494
28:37
You could then ask--This makes
a prediction that babies should

495
28:41
themselves prefer the creature
who's the helper versus the

496
28:45
hinderer,
and to explore this,

497
28:47
a graduate student in this
department, Kiley Hamlin,

498
28:50
has started a series of studies
where they show babies

499
28:53
three-dimensional scenes and
then give them the characters

500
28:56
and see which one they reach
for.

501
28:59
So, here's video so you could
see how this experiment is done.

502
29:01


503
30:01
Now, the next trial is from a
different study.

504
30:04
A different thing we use,
and the baby is given a choice.

505
30:08
One thing to know
methodologically is the person

506
30:11
giving a choice is blind to the
study.

507
30:14
And blind here is a technical
term meaning she had no idea

508
30:17
what the baby saw,
and the point about this is to

509
30:20
avoid either intentional or
unintentional sort of trying to

510
30:24
get the answer you want.
She couldn't do that because

511
30:26
she didn't know what the right
answer is.

512
30:28
So, here's what the baby would
see.

513
30:29


514
30:40
So, this suggests that some
social understanding may be

515
30:47
there from the very start.
This evidence is tentative,

516
30:52
very controversial.
But now, I want to raise a huge

517
30:57
developmental puzzle and the
puzzle is there are some ways in

518
31:02
which babies are--not just
babies,

519
31:05
but young children are very
clueless when it comes to

520
31:10
people.
And so, I have a film clip here

521
31:13
of two very nice studies showing
babies' ignorant--sorry,

522
31:16
young children's ignorance of
other people.

523
31:19
I'll show you the studies and
then we'll briefly discuss what

524
31:26
they mean.
Professor Paul Bloom:

525
31:28
Before discussing that example
in a little bit more detail,

526
31:32
any questions?
What are your questions?

527
31:33
Yes, in back.
Student: [inaudible]

528
31:36
Professor Paul Bloom:
Typically--I don't know for

529
31:39
those particular children,
but typically on those tasks

530
31:42
three-year-olds and young
four-year-olds tend to fail,

531
31:46
and around the age of four or
five kids tend to succeed.

532
31:50
There's sort of a period around
the age of four,

533
31:53
four and a half,
where kids make the transition

534
31:56
from failure to success.
The question,

535
31:58
by the way, was when do
children--in that video when

536
32:01
were the--what were the ages of
the children who failed and who

537
32:04
passed?

538
32:04


539
32:07
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

540
32:13
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question of whether

541
32:19
discriminant conditioning has
been used with babies to explore

542
32:25
what sort of concepts they have.
I don't know.

543
32:31
Does anybody--It has been--
Graduate Student:

544
32:34
--It's not as effective--
Professor Paul Bloom:

545
32:37
Koleen answered and said that
it's not as effective as other

546
32:40
methods.
Part of the problem with using

547
32:42
operant conditioning with babies
is it's difficult to get them to

548
32:46
behave in any systematic way.
So, the looking-time measures

549
32:51
tend to be more subtle.
Any other questions?

550
32:56


551
33:01
Oh.
Yes.

552
33:03
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

553
33:09
Oh.
The question of why they

554
33:11
chose--the baby--the kids chose
the rocket ship one as opposed

555
33:14
to the Rafael one.
It wasn't what they were

556
33:17
interested in in the experiment.
And my bet is when they chose

557
33:20
the stickers they had a pretty
good sense of why,

558
33:23
of which ones the boys would
prefer in those studies.

559
33:26
The question of why a boy might
prefer one sort of sticker,

560
33:30
and you might get a different
response with a girl,

561
33:33
is going to come up later when
we discuss different theories of

562
33:36
sex differences.
But that was something I think

563
33:38
they were just assuming in the
study to get it off the ground.

564
33:40


565
33:47
Okay.

566
33:48


567
33:54
There's a huge debate over
what's going on there.

568
33:58
And if you listened at the end
to the psychologist summarizing

569
34:02
the data, the psychologist had a
very good and very clear and

570
34:05
strong idea of what was going
on.

571
34:08
It was that children need to
know more about minds.

572
34:11
The children don't know about
that you can do something with

573
34:15
the intent to deceive.
They don't understand that

574
34:19
somebody could choose what you
chose in a malicious way.

575
34:24
This is possible.
This is one respectable theory,

576
34:29
but the alternative is they
have the right knowledge,

577
34:34
but they suffer from problems
with inhibition.

578
34:38
So, consider both studies.
The first study,

579
34:40
the one with the deceptive
dolls with the big shoes and

580
34:43
little shoes,
is actually fairly difficult.

581
34:46
And it's possible that children
kind of got overwhelmed with it,

582
34:50
and when asked what would the
mother think,

583
34:53
who the mother would think
stole the food,

584
34:56
responded with who really stole
the food.

585
34:59
And that there's some pull
towards the right answer that

586
35:02
makes this task difficult.
The second one--the second

587
35:06
study illustrates this issue
even more clearly.

588
35:09
Take the boy who kept failing.
He kept pointing to the rocket

589
35:14
ship and mean monkey kept taking
it away.

590
35:16
It's possible that he genuinely
didn't know what to do,

591
35:20
that he wasn't smart enough to
understand that he needed to

592
35:24
point to the other one.
But it's also possible that

593
35:28
it's a Homer Simpson-like
effect, where when asked to

594
35:32
point to what he wants,
he just couldn't help but point

595
35:36
to the one he wanted.
And that the extra work it

596
35:40
takes to lie was beyond him.
And, in support of the second

597
35:45
alternative, even adults find
these tasks involving lying and

598
35:50
deception more difficult.
They were slower at them.

599
35:53
We make more mistakes than
tasks that don't involve lying

600
35:58
and deception.
So, I'm raising this not to

601
36:01
solve the problem.
You'll read more about it in

602
36:04
the Peter Gray textbook and more
about it in The Norton

603
36:08
readings on development,
but just to raise this as an

604
36:12
interesting area of debate.
Another interesting area of

605
36:17
debate is, "What's the
relationship between different

606
36:22
sorts of development?"
So, I started off with Piaget,

607
36:27
and Piaget, like Freud,
believed in general,

608
36:31
across the board changes in how
children think.

609
36:36
An alternative,
though, is that there's

610
36:39
separate modules,
and this is a view developed,

611
36:43
again, by Noam Chomsky,
and also by the philosopher of

612
36:47
mind Jerry Fodor,
who claimed that the whole idea

613
36:50
of a child developing as a
single story is mistaken.

614
36:54
What you get instead is there
are separate pre-wired systems

615
36:58
for reasoning about the world.
These systems have some

616
37:02
built-in knowledge,
and they have to do some

617
37:06
learning,
but the learning pattern varies

618
37:09
from system to system and
there's a separateness to them.

619
37:13
Why should we take this view
seriously?

620
37:15
Well, one reason is that there
are developmental disorders that

621
37:20
seem to involve damage to one
system but not to another.

622
37:24
And the classic case of this is
a disorder known as autism.

623
37:27
And autism is something I've
always found a fascinating

624
37:31
disorder for many reasons.
It's actually why I entered

625
37:34
psychology.
I started off working with

626
37:37
children with autism.
And it could be taken as a

627
37:40
striking illustration of how the
social part of your brain is

628
37:44
distinct from other parts of
your brain.

629
37:48
So, what autism is is a
disorder that strikes about one

630
37:51
in a thousand people,
mostly boys.

631
37:54
And the dominant problems
concern--consist of a lack of

632
37:59
social connectedness,
problems with language,

633
38:02
problems dealing with people,
and more generally,

634
38:05
a problem of what the
psychologist,

635
38:08
Simon Baron-Cohen has described
as "mind blindness."

636
38:12
In that autistic people show no
impairments dealing with the

637
38:15
physical world,
they show no impairments

638
38:17
on--they don't necessarily show
any impairments on mathematical

639
38:21
skills or spatial skills,
but they have a lot of problems

640
38:25
with people.
Now, many autistic children

641
38:28
have no language;
they're totally shut off from

642
38:31
society.
But even some of them who'd

643
38:33
learned language and who managed
to get some sort of independent

644
38:36
life,
nevertheless will suffer from a

645
38:39
severe social impairment.
And this could be shown in all

646
38:42
sorts of ways.
A simple experiment developed

647
38:45
by Simon Baron-Cohen goes like
this.

648
38:48
You show this to three- and
four-year-olds.

649
38:50
There's four candies there,
and you say,

650
38:52
"This is Charlie in the middle.
Which chocolate will Charlie

651
38:56
take?"
For most children and most of

652
38:59
you, I hope, the answer's pretty
clear: This one.

653
39:02
Autistic children will often
just shrug, say,

654
39:05
"How could I know?"
because they don't

655
39:08
instinctively appreciate that
people's interests and desires

656
39:11
tend to be attuned to where
they're looking.

657
39:14
Another sort of task,
which is a task that's been

658
39:18
done hundreds,
perhaps thousands of times,

659
39:20
is known as "the false-belief
task" and here's the idea.

660
39:24
You show the child the
following situation.

661
39:28
There's a doll named Maxie and
Maxie puts the ball in the

662
39:34
cupboard.
Maxie leaves and a second doll

663
39:38
enters.
The second doll takes the ball

664
39:41
out of the cupboard and puts it
under the bed.

665
39:45
Maxie comes back and the
question is, "Where will Maxie

666
39:49
look for the ball?"
Now, this is a question about

667
39:53
your understanding about minds.
The question of where is the

668
39:58
ball really is a question about
the physical world.

669
40:01
Everyone can solve it,
but this question is hard.

670
40:05
The right answer is Max
will--Maxie will look in the

671
40:09
cupboard, even though it's not
really there because Maxie has a

672
40:15
false belief about the world.
Three-year-olds find this

673
40:19
difficult.
Two-year-olds find this

674
40:21
difficult.
Four-year-olds and

675
40:23
five-year-olds are able to pass
this task.

676
40:25
Normal adults are able to pass
this task.

677
40:28
Children with autism have
serious problems.

678
40:30
And often, people with autism
who are otherwise very high

679
40:34
functioning will fail this task.
They'll say,

680
40:36
"Oh, he must think it's
not--He'll--He's going to check

681
40:38
under the bed."
Any questions about autism?

682
40:43


683
40:47
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

684
40:52
Professor Paul Bloom:
Good question.

685
40:57
It isn't.
They're both experiments

686
41:00
designed to tap an appreciation
of false belief.

687
41:03
The deception one with the
shoes and everything looked at

688
41:07
it in the course of deception.
Can you understand that the

689
41:10
mother might think it's that
person even though it's really

690
41:14
that person?
And our kid failed.

691
41:16
This is a sort of stripped-down
version without all the

692
41:22
fanciness but it tests exactly
the same thing.

693
41:27
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

694
41:30
Professor Paul Bloom:
Nobody knows,

695
41:33
but there's a theory which
won't answer your question but

696
41:36
will put it into a broader
context.

697
41:38
Simon Baron-Cohen argues that
there are certain abilities that

698
41:42
tend to be more sequestered for
males,

699
41:45
and other abilities that are
more sequestered,

700
41:48
more focused on females.
Social abilities,

701
41:51
he argues, tend to be more
female than male.

702
41:54
So, the way Baron puts it,
provocatively,

703
41:57
is to be a man is to suffer
from a very mild form of autism

704
42:01
[laughter].
The idea is then that autistic

705
42:04
individuals suffer from what he
calls extreme male brains,

706
42:08
and as such,
it stands to reason that they'd

707
42:11
be more sampled from the male
population than the female

708
42:14
population.
That's such an interesting

709
42:16
issue, that again,
when we return to talk about

710
42:19
sex differences we'll look at
that in a little bit more detail

711
42:22
to see if it's supported by the
evidence.

712
42:25
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

713
42:30
Professor Paul Bloom:
I'm sorry.

714
42:36
Tell me the--Is the severity of
autism… Student:

715
42:41
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

716
42:44
It's an interesting question.
The question is,

717
42:49
"How do you think about the
severity of autism with regard

718
42:52
to developmental stages?"
And sort of surprisingly,

719
42:57
autism can't really be thought
of in that way.

720
43:01
So, it's not like an adult with
autism is like a three-year-old

721
43:04
or a two-year-old.
In some ways,

722
43:06
somebody with autism isn't like
any child at all,

723
43:09
any normally developing child
at all.

724
43:12
So, it's not really a
developmental delay in the way

725
43:16
that it might make sense to
think about certain forms of

726
43:20
retardation.
On the other hand,

727
43:22
when we think about how severe
autism is we do look at things

728
43:25
like how much language does the
person have,

729
43:28
and in that sense,
it is related to development.

730
43:32
Yes.
Student:

731
43:34
What are the chances that
someone who's autistic would be

732
43:37
able to overcome their
deficiencies?

733
43:39
Professor Paul Bloom:
The majority of people with

734
43:42
autism.
It's a good question.

735
43:43
The question is,
"What are the chances that

736
43:45
somebody with autism will be
able to overcome their

737
43:48
deficiencies?"
Autism is a funny disorder in

738
43:50
that there's a lot of media
publication and media

739
43:53
presentation.
Often the people who are

740
43:55
showcased in the media tend to
be very exceptional.

741
43:58
So, there's a woman,
Temple Grandin,

742
44:00
who's autistic and--Has anybody
here heard of Temple Grandin?

743
44:04
She wrote some wonderful books
about her experience as an

744
44:07
autistic person,
but she's very unusual.

745
44:09
So a lot depends,
to answer your question,

746
44:12
how one defines autism,
and whether one includes

747
44:15
Asperger syndrome,
which is a limited,

748
44:18
a more mild syndrome,
as a form of autism.

749
44:22
The answer is that the majority
of people with autism have

750
44:25
severe problems,
and will not,

751
44:27
and at this stage,
with this level of therapy,

752
44:30
will not lead a normal life.
Student:

753
44:33
More specifically,
what I meant was,

754
44:36
when you showed the example of
Rain Man, ere they exceptional

755
44:41
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

756
44:44
Right.
The question is about so-called

757
44:48
autistic savants.
So, Rain Man,

758
44:50
the character played by Dustin
Hoffman, had extraordinary

759
44:53
mathematical abilities.
And some people with autism

760
44:56
have extraordinary artistic
abilities or mathematical

761
45:00
abilities or musical abilities
and these are amazing.

762
45:05
It's an amazing question why
they have it but this is a very

763
45:09
small minority.
This is a very--It's

764
45:11
fascinating that it happens at
all, that you have severe damage

765
45:15
but compensated with some
powerful skill.

766
45:17
Now, I know I'm answering your
question I think in a better

767
45:20
way, but it's actually very
rare.

768
45:22
Most people with autism do not
have any exceptional abilities

769
45:24
that go along with it.

770
45:25


771
45:31
Another question is if you
believe in modules--If there are

772
45:37
modules, what are they?
And so far when reviewing the

773
45:41
developmental data we've talked
about two of them:

774
45:45
physics and people.
An object module and a social

775
45:49
module.
But other people have argued

776
45:51
that there is a special module
in your brain for dealing with

777
45:54
artifacts,
that is, things like tables and

778
45:57
chairs and cars and forks.
Some people have argued there's

779
46:01
a module for sociology,
for dealing with human groups,

780
46:04
races and classes and so on.
Some have even argued that

781
46:08
there is an intuitive biology,
a common-sense biological

782
46:12
understanding of the world
that's separate from your

783
46:15
understanding of people and
physics.

784
46:18
And, in fact,
the most dominant proponent of

785
46:22
the view is our very own Frank
Keil,

786
46:25
Master of Morse College at
Yale, who has strongly defended

787
46:29
the notion of an intuitive
biological module.

788
46:33
Final question,
just to raise:

789
46:35
I've talked in terms of the
modular view but there might

790
46:40
also be profound general
differences between children and

791
46:44
adults,
not just specific to how you

792
46:46
think about objects or how you
think about people or how you

793
46:48
think about this or how you
think about that,

794
46:50
but rather more general.
And one claim,

795
46:53
which we're going to return to
briefly next class when we talk

796
46:57
about language,
is that there's a very,

797
46:59
very big difference between a
creature that doesn't have

798
47:03
language and a creature that
does.

799
47:06
And part of the claim is that
learning a language,

800
47:09
learning to speak,
reconfigures the human brain in

801
47:13
such a way that is really
exceptional.

802
47:16
And that has no parallel in any
other species.

803
47:19
And this is an interesting
claim and one we'll talk about.

804
47:24
Finally, I want to end with an
example from Stephen Jay Gould.

805
47:29
Suppose you hate development;
you hate developmental

806
47:33
psychology;
you hate babies;

807
47:35
you hate children;
they're not cute;

808
47:37
they're ugly;
you don't want to have them;

809
47:39
you don't want to study them;
you're annoyed that we have to

810
47:41
discuss them.
Fine.

811
47:43
But there are reasons to study
development even if you are not

812
47:49
interested in children because
sometimes developmental studies

813
47:54
and developmental data and
developmental science can inform

814
48:00
questions about adults.
And Stephen Jay Gould has a

815
48:03
very nice example of this.
He asked the question "Is a

816
48:07
zebra a black animal with white
stripes or a white animal with

817
48:12
black stripes?"
Now, you could look at adult

818
48:15
zebras all day long and you're
never going to figure this out.

819
48:19
But if you want to know the
answer, and I knew it,

820
48:22
but I forget what it is--It
doesn't matter.

821
48:24
But if you wanted to know it
you could.

822
48:26
You would look at development
and you'd watch the

823
48:29
embryological development of a
zebra and that's how you would

824
48:31
learn the answer to your
question.

825
48:33
In fact, I'll end with a nice
quote.

826
48:36
This is by the famous
biologist, D'Arcy Thompson,

827
48:40
who wrote the book On Growth
and Form,

828
48:44
and it's sort of the model
of many developmental

829
48:47
psychologists and many
evolutionary psychologists so

830
48:50
I'll end with this:
"Everything is the way it is

831
48:52
because it got that way."
Okay.

832
48:55
I'll see you next week.
