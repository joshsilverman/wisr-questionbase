This lecture will be a some
slightly shorter lecture than

2
0:17
usual.
What I first want to do is

3
0:19
finish off the discussion of
clinical psychology from last

4
0:22
lecture and then have a little
brief discussion about some very

5
0:26
interesting research on
happiness.

6
0:28
We talked--we ended last
lecture with a discussion of

7
0:32
some early--some of the history
of treating mental illness and

8
0:36
we saw that it was rather
gruesome,

9
0:38
unsuccessful, and arbitrary.
For the most part,

10
0:42
we do better now,
and Dr.

11
0:43
Nolen-Hoeksema reviewed some of
the therapies with focus on

12
0:47
therapies for depression.
The textbook talks in detail

13
0:51
about therapies for different
disorders including

14
0:55
schizophrenia,
anxiety disorders,

15
0:57
and so on.
The question which everyone is

16
1:01
interested in is,
"Does therapy work?"

17
1:03
And this proves to be
surprisingly difficult to tell.

18
1:08
Part of the problem is if you
ask people who go into therapy,

19
1:13
"Did you get better after
therapy?"

20
1:16
for the most part they'll tell
you that they did but the

21
1:20
problem is this could be a
statistical byproduct of what's

22
1:24
called "regression to the mean."
So, the idea looks like this.

23
1:29
This line plots how you feel
from great through okay to awful

24
1:33
and it goes up and down and in
fact in everyday life you're

25
1:37
going to--some days are going to
be average,

26
1:40
some days will be better than
average, some days worse than

27
1:43
average.
You could plot your semester.

28
1:45
You could do a plot every
morning when you wake up or

29
1:47
every night before you go to
bed.

30
1:48
You could put yourself on a
graph and it'll come out to some

31
1:52
sort of wiggly thing.
Statistically,

32
1:55
if something is above average
or below average it's going to

33
1:59
trend towards average just
because that's a statistical

34
2:03
inevitability.
When do people go to therapy?

35
2:07
Well, they go to therapy when
they're feeling really crappy.

36
2:10
They go to therapy when they're
feeling unusually bad.

37
2:13
Even if therapy then has no
effect at all,

38
2:16
if it's true that people's
moods tend to go up and down

39
2:20
after you feel really bad you'll
probably improve rather than get

40
2:25
worse.
And so this could happen--the

41
2:28
normal flow could happen just
even if therapy has no effect at

42
2:32
all.
And so, simply getting better

43
2:34
after therapy doesn't tell you
anything.

44
2:36
On the worst day of your life
you could do naked jumping jacks

45
2:40
on the roof of your college for
ten minutes.

46
2:43
I guarantee you your next day
would probably be better.

47
2:47
That doesn't mean naked jumping
jacks are helping you.

48
2:50
Rather, it just means that the
day after the worst day of your

49
2:52
life usually is not as bad as
the worst day of your life.

50
2:55
It can get worse,
but usually it just trends to

51
2:58
average.
What you've got to do then is

52
3:01
you have to take people at the
same point who would get

53
3:05
treatment and compare them to
people who do not get treatment

54
3:10
or what we call a "control
group."

55
3:13
And this is an example of this.
So, this is for people who are

56
3:17
depressed.
This is statistically equal.

57
3:19
They start off pre-therapy.
They all go for therapy but

58
3:23
because in this example there's
a limited number of therapists,

59
3:28
some of them are put on a
waiting list and others get a

60
3:31
therapist.
It's arbitrary.

61
3:33
It's random,
which is--which--making it a

62
3:35
very good experiment.
And in this example,

63
3:38
you could see those who
received cognitive training were

64
3:41
better off.
They had lower depression

65
3:44
scores than those that received
no therapy at all.

66
3:47
In general, in fact,
we could make some general

67
3:51
conclusions about therapy.
Therapy by and large works.

68
3:57
People in treatment do better
than those who are not in

69
4:00
treatment and that's not merely
because they choose to go into

70
4:04
treatment.
Rather, it's people who are in

71
4:08
desperate straits who seek out
help.

72
4:11
Those who get help are likely
to be better off than those that

73
4:15
don't get help.
Therapy for the most part works.

74
4:18
We can't cure a lot of things
but we can often make them

75
4:24
better.
Different sorts of therapy

76
4:27
works best for different
problems, and again,

77
4:30
depression proves to be an
illustrative example.

78
4:33
If you have everyday unipolar
depression, that is,

79
4:36
you feel very sad and you show
other symptoms associated with

80
4:40
depression,
an excellent treatment for you

81
4:43
is some combination of cognitive
behavioral therapy and possibly

82
4:48
antidepressant medications like
SSRIs.

83
4:51
If you have bipolar depression,
the cognitive behavioral

84
4:55
therapy is useless but
medication is your best bet and

85
4:59
so on for all of the other
disorders.

86
5:02
Each disorder has some sort of
optimal mode of treatment.

87
5:07
If you suffer from an anxiety
disorder, cognitive behavioral

88
5:10
therapy can be of help.
If you're a schizophrenic it's

89
5:13
probably not going to be of much
help at all.

90
5:16
And so, different disorders go
best with different sorts of

91
5:20
therapies.
Finally, some therapists do

92
5:23
better than others.
So, for reasons that nobody

93
5:27
fully understands,
there are good therapists and

94
5:29
then there are better therapists
and there are bad therapists.

95
5:32
And there's great individual
differences in the efficacy of

96
5:37
an individual therapist.
Finally, putting aside then the

97
5:41
difference in therapies and the
difference in therapists,

98
5:46
does it make sense to say that
therapy, in general,

99
5:50
works?
And the answer is "yes."

100
5:53
And this is in large part
because of what clinical

101
5:57
psychologists describe as
"nonspecific factors."

102
6:00
And what this just is a term
meaning properties that all

103
6:04
therapies, or virtually all
therapies, share and I've listed

104
6:08
two of them here.
One of them is "support."

105
6:11
No matter what sort of therapy
you're getting involved in,

106
6:15
be it a psychoanalyst or a
behavior therapist or a

107
6:18
cognitive therapist or a
psychiatrist who prescribes you

108
6:22
medication or someone who makes
you go through different

109
6:26
exercises or keeps a journal,
you have some sense of support,

110
6:31
some acceptance,
empathy, encouragement,

111
6:33
guidance.
You have a human touch.

112
6:37
You have somebody who for at
least some of the day really

113
6:40
cares about you and wants you to
be better and that could make a

114
6:44
huge difference.
Also you have hope.

115
6:49
Typically, there's an
enthusiasm behind therapy.

116
6:54
There's a sense that this might
really make me get better and

117
6:57
that hope could be powerful.
Sometimes this is viewed under

118
7:01
the rubric of a placebo effect,
which is that maybe the

119
7:04
benefits you get from therapy
aren't due to anything in

120
7:07
particular the therapist does to
you but rather to the belief

121
7:10
that things are going to get
better,

122
7:13
something is being done that
will help you.

123
7:16
And this belief can be a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

124
7:20
"Placebo effect" is often used
sort of in a dismissive way,

125
7:24
"Oh, it's just a placebo,"
but placebos can be powerful

126
7:29
and even if it's useless from a
real point--from a psychological

127
7:34
theory point of view,
even if the therapist runs

128
7:37
around and dances while you –
I have dancing on my mind now

129
7:41
– while you sit in the chair
and watch him dance;

130
7:44
if you believe the dancing is
going to make you better,

131
7:48
it may well help.
Okay.

132
7:50
That's all I'm going to say
about therapy.

133
7:52
Any questions about therapy?
Yes.

134
7:57
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

135
8:22
Fair enough.
The question is the assumption

136
8:30
of regression to the mean seems
sort of arbitrary because it

137
8:34
depends what the mean is.
Always after the fact you can

138
8:37
apply an average to it and say,
"Look.

139
8:39
This is the average," but how
do you know beforehand?

140
8:42
It's a good point.
When you talk about regression

141
8:46
to the mean, it adopts certain
assumptions.

142
8:50
The assumption is there really
is an average throughout much of

143
8:54
your life and things go up and
down within that average and for

144
8:58
the most part that's true for
things like mood.

145
9:01
For most of us,
we have an average mood and we

146
9:04
have bad days and we have good
days.

147
9:06
It's always possible that you
have a bad day and then from

148
9:10
there on in it's just going to
go down and down and down but

149
9:14
statistically the best bet is if
you have a bad day you're going

150
9:18
to go back up to the mean.
It's--in some way you don't

151
9:22
even have to see it from a
clinical point of view.

152
9:28
You could map it out yourself.
Map out your moods and the days

153
9:32
where you're most depressed
sooner or later you're likely to

154
9:37
go up.
Similarly, on the happiest day

155
9:40
of your life odds are the next
day you're going to go down and

156
9:45
there's nothing magical about
this.

157
9:49
This is just because under the
assumption that there really is

158
9:52
an average in--built into
one--each of us.

159
9:54
If human behavior was
arbitrary, it would be like a

160
9:57
random walk but it's not.
We seem to have sort of set

161
10:00
points and aspects of us that we
fall back to that make the idea

162
10:04
of a mean a psychologically
plausible claim.

163
10:07


164
10:12
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

165
10:16
Professor Paul Bloom:
That's a good question.

166
10:22
Yes.
In that study it's a perfectly

167
10:25
good hypothesis that the sort of
anxiety of being told,

168
10:28
"I see you've come here for
help.

169
10:30
We can't give it to you.
Congratulations.

170
10:33
You're a control group"
[laughs]

171
10:36
causes anxiety.
In other studies the control

172
10:39
group doesn't know they are the
control group.

173
10:42
So sometimes you can do an
intervention where you say,

174
10:45
"Congratulations,
everybody in Intro Psych who

175
10:48
did very low on the depression
inventory,"

176
10:51
which many of you filled out,
"We're going to do something to

177
10:54
you."
And then the rest of the people

178
10:56
don't even know that they
haven't been chosen.

179
10:59
So, you're right.
It's a perfectly good point.

180
11:01
Knowing you're not chosen could
have a deleterious effect and

181
11:05
the way to respond to that is
you have other studies that

182
11:08
don't use that same method.

183
11:09


184
11:16
Okay.
I want to end with happiness

185
11:23
and it's a strange thing to talk
about in psychology.

186
11:28
Most of psychology focuses on
human misery,

187
11:32
most of clinical psychology.
There is the psychology we

188
11:36
spoke about through most of the
semester on vision and language

189
11:40
and social behavior,
but typically when people think

190
11:43
about interventions what they
think about is people having

191
11:47
problems and then we figure out
how to make them better.

192
11:51
They are schizophrenic,
they are depressed or anxious,

193
11:54
they are just not making it in
life,

194
11:56
and psychologists try to figure
out how to make things improve.

195
12:00
And in fact,
a lot of the information I gave

196
12:03
you at the beginning of the
lecture last class where I

197
12:06
reviewed all of the disorders is
in this wonderful book called

198
12:10
DSM-IV,
The Diagnostic and Statistical

199
12:13
Manual of Mental Disorders.
If you ever really want to

200
12:16
get--If you really [laughs]
want to diagnose people and

201
12:19
come to have a belief in your
own mental instability,

202
12:23
browsing through that book is a
treat.

203
12:26
Everything that can go wrong in
mental life from Aspergers

204
12:31
syndrome to fetishes to paranoid
schizophrenia is all in that

205
12:36
wonderful book and--but a lot of
psychologists have been

206
12:40
disturbed by the focus of our
field on taking bad people,

207
12:46
people who are broken,
people who are sad,

208
12:48
and bringing them up to normal.
And they've started to ask can

209
12:52
psychology give us any insight
into human flourishing,

210
12:57
how to take people who
are--who--how to study people

211
13:00
who are psychological successes,
how to take people who are

212
13:04
psychologically okay and make
them better.

213
13:07
And this is the movement known
as "positive psychology."

214
13:11
And it has its own handbook
now, The Handbook of Positive

215
13:15
Psychology, listing
psychological strengths,

216
13:18
listing virtues,
ways--what psychology tells us

217
13:22
about how we can be at our best.
Some of this work in positive

218
13:29
psychology is,
in my mind, real crap.

219
13:33
A lot of it is some combination
of new age banalities by people

220
13:37
who are striving to get more
grant funds and end up on

221
13:41
Time magazine.
On the other hand--and so,

222
13:44
some of it is really bad.
You could imagine this attracts

223
13:48
every self-help huckster you
could imagine.

224
13:51
On the other hand,
a lot of this work is quite

225
13:54
neat, quite interesting and
quite promising.

226
13:57
And what I want to do is tell
you what I think is the most

227
14:00
interesting research from this
movement concerning happiness.

228
14:04
Now, there are a lot of good
books on this and I'm going to

229
14:07
recommend books,
which I haven't been doing much

230
14:09
in this class.
Marty Seligman is the pioneer

231
14:12
of positive psychology and he's
written an excellent book called

232
14:16
Authentic Happiness.
Jonathan Haidt is a brilliant

233
14:20
young scholar who's done--also
done a lot of work on disgust

234
14:24
and morality.
He did the "sex with dead

235
14:28
chicken study" we discussed
earlier.

236
14:31
This is one of my favorite
books by – Happiness by

237
14:34
Nettle, because it's smart,
it's beautifully written and

238
14:37
it's extremely short.
And Dan Gilbert's book,

239
14:40
Stumbling on Happiness,
is a very, very funny book and

240
14:43
very smart book and is now on
The New York Times

241
14:46
bestseller list.
So, there's no shortage of

242
14:49
books on happiness.
So, the starting point is--And

243
14:53
a lot of research on happiness
starts with a basic question:

244
14:57
How happy are you?
And we're psychologists so tell

245
15:01
us on a scale of one to ten
where five is average,

246
15:06
ten is super-duper.
The most common answers,

247
15:10
interestingly enough,
are high.

248
15:12
They're seven or eight.
How many people in this room

249
15:15
would give themselves a seven or
an eight?

250
15:18
Okay.
How many a nine or a ten?

251
15:20
All right.
How many a ten?

252
15:25
Good, good, maxed out on
happiness.

253
15:27
It turns out that most people
think that they're pretty happy.

254
15:32
There's a Lake Wobegon effect
with happiness.

255
15:34
Most people think they're very
happy.

256
15:35
In fact, most people think
they're happier than most

257
15:38
people, which shouldn't really
happen.

258
15:40
This question,
"How happy are you from one to

259
15:45
ten?"
has been asked all over the

260
15:48
world.
So--and it turns out there are

261
15:51
slight differences depending on
how old you are.

262
15:55
There are slight differences
depending on your place within a

263
16:00
country, California versus New
York.

264
16:03
There are slight,
subtle differences between men

265
16:06
and women at different points,
somewhat paradoxically.

266
16:09
Although women are more
vulnerable to depression than

267
16:14
men, still on average women are
slightly happier than men.

268
16:19
The country-by-country data is
quite interesting.

269
16:22
In one study they looked at
forty-two countries.

270
16:24
The happiest--well, let me see.
The happiest people on

271
16:28
earth--well, first,
no country believed they were

272
16:31
unhappy, the people in no
country of these forty-two

273
16:34
countries.
I mean, you're thinking there

274
16:37
are some really bad countries to
live in and I don't know if they

275
16:40
were tested but of these
forty-two everybody seemed--said

276
16:42
they were above average.
The happiest people on earth?

277
16:45
The Swiss.
[laughter]

278
16:48
They think--they're just
like--they're just so happy.

279
16:51
I was talking to people about
this last night and they

280
16:55
suggested chocolate.
[laughter]

281
16:57
The saddest people on this--on
the sample?

282
17:00
The sad Bulgarians.
[laughter]

283
17:03
You are wondering what about
Americans.

284
17:07
Americans are actually pretty
happy, 7.71.

285
17:10
We are a happy country full of
happy people.

286
17:15
Now, I'm going to talk about a
lot of research that's based on

287
17:19
the data you get when you ask
people how happy they are from a

288
17:22
scale of one to ten.
But I'm going to be honest and

289
17:26
tell you there are reasons to be
cautious about these numbers.

290
17:32
And the reasons come from a
couple of experiments.

291
17:37
In one experiment they asked
people inside a psychology

292
17:40
department where there was a
photocopy machine.

293
17:43
They went up to people--the
people were going up to the

294
17:46
photocopy machine to make copies
and when they were done making

295
17:49
copies they asked them,
"How happy are you with your

296
17:51
entire life?"
There were two groups.

297
17:54
Group A, they put a dime on top
of the photocopy machine so

298
17:57
people walked over there,
"I'm going to [inaudible].

299
18:00
Oh, a dime.
Well."

300
18:02
The other group, no dime.
It turned out that when asked

301
18:08
"How good is your whole life?"
[laughter]

302
18:10
group A reported [laughter]
greater life satisfaction

303
18:15
overall in their entire lives.
Another study asked people how

304
18:19
happy you are with your whole
life on sunny days like today

305
18:24
and people said they were
happier on sunny days than rainy

306
18:28
days.
What's interesting is you could

307
18:31
make this effect go away if you
ask immediately before "How's

308
18:35
the weather?"
These were done by phone

309
18:37
interviews.
And logically,

310
18:39
what seems to go on is that if
you're asked how's the weather,

311
18:46
you're "Oh, it's really sunny
outside," and then when people

312
18:48
are asked "How happy are you
with your whole life?"

313
18:51
people then say, "Oh, okay.
I'm going to take into account

314
18:54
the sunny-ness when I give my
answer.

315
18:57
Okay.
So, what is happiness?

316
19:02
What are people rating when
they're answering these sort of

317
19:06
questions?
And this is an extraordinarily

318
19:09
difficult question and one could
devote a seminar to discussing

319
19:13
it,
but one simple answer from an

320
19:15
evolutionary point of view is
that happiness--forget about

321
19:18
"what is happiness?"
Ask "what's happiness for?"

322
19:21
just like we've asked what
language is for,

323
19:23
or what laughter is for,
or what hunger or lust is for.

324
19:26
What's happiness for?
And one answer is happiness is

325
19:30
a goal state that we've evolved
to pursue.

326
19:32
It's a signal that our needs
have been satisfied.

327
19:35
Happiness is the carrot we're
running towards that makes us

328
19:39
take care of our lives.
We want to be happy.

329
19:42
An example of this is food.
You're not very happy if you're

330
19:47
starving.
You want to be satiated,

331
19:49
you want to be satisfied,
so you seek out food to fill

332
19:52
your belly.
Once you've done it,

333
19:55
you're happy.
Steven Pinker summarizes the

334
19:58
keys to happiness in a nicely
evocative passage:

335
20:03
"We are happier when we are
healthy,

336
20:06
well-fed, comfortable,
safe, prosperous,

337
20:09
knowledgeable,
respected, non-celibate,

338
20:11
in love."
How many people here have got

339
20:15
all of those right now?
Oh, come on.

340
20:18
[laughter] Some people.
Oddly enough,

341
20:20
the person who said he was a
ten didn't--does not raise his

342
20:23
hand.
Okay.

343
20:25
[laughter]
So this is- And this makes

344
20:27
out--you get all your needs
satisfied,

345
20:30
your belly is full,
people love you,

346
20:33
you're getting sex regularly,
you're smart,

347
20:38
you're rich,
you're happy,

348
20:40
but as Pinker points out it's
not that simple.

349
20:45
Here's the problem.

350
20:47


351
20:50
You, Americans in this century,
you are now healthier,

352
20:56
better fed and so on than just
about anyone in history but

353
21:02
you're not happier.
That's the puzzle.

354
21:06
In particular,
these studies asking about

355
21:09
happiness have been around for a
long time.

356
21:12
People in the 1950s did not
make as much money,

357
21:17
did not eat as well,
did not live as long,

358
21:21
suffered from more diseases,
were more vulnerable in a

359
21:24
hundred different ways,
yet they were--are as happy as

360
21:28
you are now.
You are as happy as your

361
21:31
parents were and they were as
happy as your grandparents.

362
21:34
Moreover, in poor countries
people don't have the shelter,

363
21:41
the knowledge,
the protection,

364
21:45
the safety, yet,
for the most part,

365
21:48
there's not a huge effect on
how rich a country is and--on

366
21:52
how happy the people are.
Furthermore,

367
21:55
there are great individual
differences in happiness among

368
22:00
people whose basic needs are
met.

369
22:03
For the most part,
everybody in this room is fed

370
22:06
and sheltered and safe.
Some of you are prosperous,

371
22:10
some of you are knowledgeable,
a couple non-celibate,

372
22:13
and-- [laughter]
but even among that group you

373
22:16
vary in your happiness,
and that's kind of a puzzle.

374
22:21
And to explain the puzzle we
need to talk about a few

375
22:25
surprising facts about happiness
and I'll present three of them.

376
22:30
The first is happiness doesn't
change as much as you think.

377
22:36
In particular,
happiness is not as sensitive

378
22:40
to what happens--your happiness
is not as sensitive to what

379
22:44
happens in your environment as
you might think it is.

380
22:49


381
22:54
Part of the reason for this is
that there appears to be a

382
22:58
strong heritable basis for
happiness.

383
23:01
So, just as we talked about the
domains of personality and

384
23:04
intelligence,
there is some genetic

385
23:06
determination,
not entirely but some,

386
23:09
in how happy you are.
And some people talk in terms

387
23:13
of a genetically determined set
point.

388
23:16
So, you have a sort of natural
happiness level,

389
23:20
maybe a range.
To put it in extreme form,

390
23:23
some people are genetically
predisposed to be pretty sour,

391
23:27
others to be pretty cheerful.

392
23:30


393
23:33
Well, that can't be it.
Identical twins are very

394
23:36
similar in their happiness but,
as with everything else we've

395
23:40
discussed, they're not
identical.

396
23:42
What about life events?
Wouldn't life events change

397
23:45
your happiness?
And here we're entering one of

398
23:47
the great discoveries of
happiness research.

399
23:50
Think for a moment.
What's the worst thing that

400
23:53
could happen to you?
And then ask how much would it

401
24:00
change your happiness.
Now, think for a moment.

402
24:05
What's the best thing that
could happen to you?

403
24:08
And ask how much would it
change your happiness.

404
24:14
And the research in happiness
suggests that your gut feelings

405
24:20
are probably wrong.
And here's a couple of case

406
24:24
studies.
For many people a very bad

407
24:26
thing that could happen to you
is to be paralyzed from the neck

408
24:31
down in an accident.
It turns out obviously,

409
24:35
common sense,
that when this happens it makes

410
24:39
people very unhappy.
It makes them depressed,

411
24:43
they think their life is over,
they feel terribly sad,

412
24:47
but not for that long.
After about a year after being

413
24:52
paralyzed from the neck down,
people's happiness comes back

414
24:57
up pretty much to where it was
before,

415
25:00
suggesting that there's a
temporary effect but not a

416
25:05
permanent one.
Many people believe that

417
25:08
winning many,
many millions of dollars in the

418
25:11
lottery will make you happier
and it does.

419
25:15
When you open up that winning
ticket and you say,

420
25:17
"I won one hundred million
dollars," you say,

421
25:19
"Woo, hoo!"
You are honest to God very

422
25:21
happy.
You'd say, "Hell,

423
25:23
I'm a 10.5, I am very happy."
A year later you are not as

424
25:29
happy.
In fact, lottery winning may be

425
25:31
a terrible case where
people--where it goes the

426
25:33
reverse of what you expect.
What happens when you win a lot

427
25:36
of money is it often wrenches
you away from your family,

428
25:39
your work and your friends and
leads you to depression and

429
25:43
sadness but even mundane events
that would make you happy--that

430
25:47
you think would make you happy
don't seem to last.

431
25:50
In some research by Dan Gilbert
and others, they've asked young

432
25:55
assistant professors who are
coming up for tenure,

433
25:59
and tenure in a university
system is a good thing to get

434
26:02
because it gives you lifetime
job security,

435
26:05
"How happy would you feel if
you got tenure?

436
26:09
How happy would you feel if you
didn't get tenure?"

437
26:11
Prior to the last election,
they asked people "How happy

438
26:16
would you be if it was President
Bush?

439
26:20
How happy would you be if it
was President Kerry?"

440
26:23
And it turns out people
radically overestimated the

441
26:27
effects of these things.
Having your favorite candidate

442
26:32
win is not such a big deal.
Having your favorite candidate

443
26:35
lose is not such a big deal
either.

444
26:37
Getting tenure or not getting
tenure are really big when it

445
26:39
happens.
Six months later and a year

446
26:41
later your happiness doesn't
seem to be affected.

447
26:45
The purchase of consumer goods,
an Xbox 360,

448
26:48
a nice flat screen TV,
those sorts of things make you

449
26:51
very happy when you open up the
package and set it up but this

450
26:56
happiness fades almost
immediately.

451
26:58
The moral of--A lot of people
are shaking their heads.

452
27:00
It's true, not for me but--the
moral of a lot of this work is

453
27:06
we think these things will have
big permanent and profound

454
27:11
effects but they need not and
they often don't.

455
27:16
Why not?
Why do we overestimate their

456
27:20
happiness?
And the technical term for

457
27:22
this, by the way,
is "affective forecasting."

458
27:26
Again, this is Dan Gilbert's
work and the idea is we are bad

459
27:29
at affective forecasting.
That is, we are bad at

460
27:33
predicting how happy or sad we
will be in the future based on

461
27:37
what's happening to us.
Why?

462
27:42
Well, a couple of reasons.
One thing is there's often a

463
27:44
failure to appreciate the
day-to-day irrelevance of

464
27:47
certain events.
So prior to the election--the

465
27:51
election's happening tomorrow
and I ask somebody who's a

466
27:55
diehard Democrat,
"How would you feel if Bush

467
27:58
won?"
and the person said,

468
28:00
"I'll be miserable.
It'll be a miserable four years

469
28:03
afterwards."
But what often isn't

470
28:06
appreciated here is that whether
or not Bush wins will make you

471
28:10
sad or happy after it happens
but for the most of your

472
28:14
day-to-day life you aren't
thinking about who the president

473
28:18
is.
I'd be very happy if I won a

474
28:22
huge prize and I'd be "Whoa,
a huge prize," the Nobel prize,

475
28:27
a Guggenheim,
a MacArthur ‘Genius' or I get

476
28:29
them all in the same day.
[laughter] "What a day.

477
28:32
I am really happy."
But then a month later I'm

478
28:36
there and I've still got my
regular insomnia and there's

479
28:40
nothing on TV and the plumber's
not coming and my kids don't

480
28:44
respect me and I can't--and the
fact that "Yeah,

481
28:48
but I won the prize," it
doesn't matter.

482
28:51
A lot of the things in life
that'll make you really--that

483
28:55
you think will make you really
happy don't have this day-to-day

484
28:58
effect.
Also, there is the logic of the

485
29:02
set point.
And this comes to a terrible

486
29:06
word: We adapt.
Right now I'm a guy without a

487
29:10
Nobel prize.
I'm kind of used to it.

488
29:13
If I got a Nobel prize I'd be a
guy with a Nobel prize.

489
29:17
I'd be happy but then I'd kind
of get used to that too.

490
29:21
And if I got a second one,
"whoa, two!"

491
29:22
but then I'd just get used to
that too.

492
29:25
You get used to things.
You get used to bad things.

493
29:29
Now, I don't want to overstate
this.

494
29:32
There are some very interesting
exceptions.

495
29:35
So for instance,
we don't get used to noise.

496
29:43
A lot of research suggests that
if your environment is noisy,

497
29:47
they're doing construction
around you, you can't get used

498
29:51
to it.
Your happiness drops and it

499
29:53
doesn't come back up.
Your system cannot habituate to

500
29:57
continued noise.
We adapt to good things,

501
30:01
winning the lottery,
winning a prize,

502
30:05
getting an "A " in a course.
We adapt, we get used to it,

503
30:11
also with some surprising
exceptions.

504
30:14
One of the big--one of the
other surprises from happiness

505
30:18
research is the effects of
cosmetic surgery like breast

506
30:21
enhancement and breast
reduction.

507
30:23
One of the big surprises is it
makes people happier and then

508
30:28
they stay happier.
And one explanation for this is

509
30:33
how we look is very important.
It's very important for how

510
30:36
other people see us and how we
see ourselves,

511
30:38
and you never get used to
looking in a certain way.

512
30:41
So, if you look better it just
makes you happier all the time.

513
30:44
So, there are these exceptions
but putting aside the

514
30:49
exceptions, the problem of
adaptation is sometimes called

515
30:54
"the hedonic treadmill" and the
idea is hedonic for happy.

516
31:00
You keep on running but no
matter how fast you run you stay

517
31:05
where you are,
you get used to it.

518
31:08
Habituation is like you
put--you step into a very hot

519
31:12
bath but you get used to it.
If it's a cold bath you get

520
31:14
used to it.
A difficult environment,

521
31:16
an easy environment,
you get used to it.

522
31:19
The story is often
illustrated--It's often

523
31:23
illustrated with a story from
the Bible in Ecclesiastes of a

524
31:28
king and this king had it all.
He had gardens,

525
31:32
parks, vineyards,
castles, slaves and concubines

526
31:37
and they were both male and
female concubines.

527
31:41
[laughter]
So, he had everything,

528
31:43
right, but it didn't make him
happy and here's what he says:

529
31:48
"I hated life.
All this vanity and a chasing

530
31:52
after wind and there is nothing
to be gained under the sun."

531
31:56
Now, in these books I talked
about at the beginning these

532
32:00
authors give advice on how to
deal with the hedonic treadmill.

533
32:05
How do you deal with the fact
that everything you aspire to,

534
32:09
once you get it you'll be used
to it and it will lose its

535
32:13
value?
Well, one answer is that

536
32:16
possessions are not the key to
happiness.

537
32:20
Possessions you very quickly
get used to.

538
32:25
From there, there are two
alternatives.

539
32:29
One is endless novelty.
So one guy – I forget his

540
32:32
name – wrote a book and he
says, "Look.

541
32:34
There's the hedonic treadmill.
The trick is always do

542
32:36
something different.
Next week have sex with

543
32:39
somebody you've never had sex
before.

544
32:41
Then climb Mount Everest.
You get bored with that,

545
32:44
become an accountant.
Boring.

546
32:46
Scuba diving.
Boring."

547
32:48
He had endless ideas,
and that's a possibility.

548
32:53
You never--you--if you keep
changing what you're doing

549
32:56
you'll never get used to
anything and you'll always be

550
32:59
happy.
At least he says that.

551
33:02
Then there's the old guy
alternative.

552
33:04
Step off the treadmill.
Give up--give up chasing the

553
33:08
whole happiness thing and then
seek out more substantial goods

554
33:12
that might actually not make you
happy in the simple sense of a

555
33:17
quick fix of delight,
but substantial goods like

556
33:21
friends and family and long-term
projects.

557
33:25
So, the first moral of the
science of happiness is that

558
33:30
your happiness is actually
rather fixed.

559
33:35
It's fixed in part genetically
and it's fixed in part because

560
33:38
what happens in your life you'll
get used to, to a large extent.

561
33:42
Are you raising your hand?
No.

562
33:43
Oh, sorry.
The second one is happiness is

563
33:53
relative.
So, there's a lot of research

564
33:57
on money, power and happiness,
and remember I did say before

565
34:01
that it doesn't matter whether
you come from a rich country or

566
34:06
a poor country.
As long as your country--as

567
34:09
long as you're not starving to
death, it kind of doesn't matter

568
34:12
how rich your country is for how
happy you are.

569
34:14
But that's not the same as
saying it doesn't matter how

570
34:18
much money you make.
In fact, there's a set point or

571
34:22
a range but there is some effect
on your salary and on your job

572
34:27
on your happiness.
And if you're desperately poor,

573
34:31
no matter where you are,
no matter who's around you,

574
34:35
you're not going to be happy.
But beyond that your happiness

575
34:40
depends on your relative
circumstance.

576
34:43
And this is an old insight.
H.L.

577
34:46
Mencken wrote,
"A wealthy man is one who earns

578
34:49
a hundred dollars more than his
wife's sister's husband."

579
34:54
The idea is what matters isn't
how much you make.

580
34:57
What matters is how much you
make relative to the people

581
35:00
around you.
And they've asked people this.

582
35:02
"What would you rather?
Do you want to make seventy

583
35:05
thousand dollars if everybody
else in your office is making

584
35:08
sixty-five thousand or
seventy-five thousand dollars if

585
35:10
everybody else is making eighty
thousand?"

586
35:13
Does it matter how much money
you bring home or does it matter

587
35:16
how much money you make relative
to other people?

588
35:20
Well, they're both factors but
relative salary--and in this

589
35:28
example people prefer this.
They prefer to be making less

590
35:34
if they're making more than the
people around them.

591
35:37
It turns out that there's
research on British social

592
35:41
servants and their happiness and
their health and the quality of

593
35:46
their relationships and how they
love their lives doesn't depend

594
35:51
on how much money they make.
It depends on where they are

595
35:55
relative to everybody else.
We are very status conscious

596
35:59
primates and your role in a
hierarchy, your level in the

597
36:03
hierarchy plays a--has a
significant effect on your level

598
36:08
of happiness.
This is not really a secret.

599
36:12
The opera star Maria Callas and
the English professor Stanley

600
36:17
Fish had the same negotiating
strategy.

601
36:21
When Fish got hired into his
department, according to urban

602
36:25
legend at least,
he said, "I don't want to talk

603
36:28
salary.
I don't have a particular

604
36:30
number in mind.
I just want to get paid one

605
36:32
hundred dollars more than
whoever is the top person in

606
36:35
this department."
And that's a guy who knows

607
36:39
about happiness.
He walks in and he states,

608
36:42
"I'm paid more than everybody
else.

609
36:44
I don't care how much it is.
It's just more."

610
36:48
[laughter]
And that's relevant to

611
36:50
happiness.
We're now in a position to give

612
36:53
some advice to the king,
summing up.

613
36:56
First, going back again to Dr.
Nolen-Hoeksema's lecture,

614
37:00
I think the king is suffering
from mild unipolar depression so

615
37:05
we should--he should get some
SSRIs and cognitive behavior

616
37:09
therapy.
I think he needs to move his

617
37:12
castle to a quiet part of the
kingdom.

618
37:15
The noise of a busy castle is
stressful.

619
37:20
And he needs to give up on the
concubines.

620
37:26
He needs to find a queen.
He needs to develop social

621
37:29
relationships,
join a club,

622
37:31
get involved in charity,
maybe a hobby.

623
37:34
The final finding is a bit of a
jump to a different topic

624
37:41
but--sorry.
You raised--yes.

625
37:44
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

626
37:50
The question is,
"Would you become used to

627
37:55
changes of social interaction?"
An example is solitary

628
38:00
confinement or prison.
People get used to a lot of

629
38:03
things.
It could be that in those

630
38:05
examples there is a shift in
status as well and social

631
38:08
relationships and how you think
of yourself relative to others

632
38:12
so that may be difficult to
recover from.

633
38:14
If you're popular at Yale and
you go to prison you're not

634
38:19
going to be very happy your
first few days in prison

635
38:23
probably.
But then suppose you get

636
38:25
popular in prison,
people like you,

637
38:28
you're the head of the book
club and everything.

638
38:31
[laughter]
You'd rather not be in

639
38:33
prison--been in prison but
you'll probably be a pretty--if

640
38:38
you're a cheerful guy here
you'll be a cheerful guy in

641
38:42
prison.
The final case is--involves

642
38:45
judgments of the pleasure and
pain of past events.

643
38:50
And I mentioned the Nobel prize
a little while ago as an example

644
38:54
but the work I'm going to talk
about is actually from the one

645
38:57
psychologist who's alive who's
won the Nobel prize--sorry,

646
39:01
one of the ones who's won the
Nobel prize, Daniel Kahneman.

647
39:05
And he became interested in
happiness.

648
39:09
And you remember him from his
rationality research and this is

649
39:12
some work on happiness.
Here's an example.

650
39:15
Anybody see the movie
Marathon Man?

651
39:18
It involves a dental torture
scene.

652
39:22
Imagine you're going to the
dentist and he's torturing you

653
39:28
or it's a cleaning but it's
really painful and it's

654
39:33
terrible.
You're sweaty,

655
39:36
you're squeezing the thing,
and it lasts for an hour and

656
39:39
then when it's done the dentist
leans over and says,

657
39:43
"We're done now.
If you want we could stop.

658
39:47
But if you want,
as a favor to you – I have

659
39:50
five minutes – I could top you
off with some mild pain."

660
39:54
This may seem like a very odd
thing to ask.

661
39:58
Here's the alternative.
What do you want?

662
40:01
A dental procedure that's very
painful for an hour or a dental

663
40:06
procedure that's very painful
for an hour--sorry about the "S"

664
40:11
there --and then some additional
mild pain?

665
40:15
Who votes for A?
You got to choose one.

666
40:18
Who votes for A?
Okay.

667
40:21
Who votes for B?
Okay.

668
40:24
Here's the big finding.
The big finding is "yes," B

669
40:30
involves more pain.
It's true.

670
40:34
"A" is an hour of pain.
"B" is an hour of pain plus a

671
40:39
few minutes of more pain.
Seems like a no-brainer but

672
40:44
when you have A or B and you
have to remember it later on

673
40:49
you'll have a much nicer memory
of B than A.

674
40:54
Kahneman's insight is when you
think back on events you don't

675
40:58
just add up the amount of
pleasure or pain you

676
41:02
experienced.
Rather, your memory is highly

677
41:05
skewed to peaks and then to
endings.

678
41:09
And you could imagine this.
In the first case,

679
41:13
"A," you leave and say,
"Oh, God, that was terrible.

680
41:16
Oh."
"B," you leave and say,

681
41:18
"Oh, that was mildly painful.
There was something terrible in

682
41:22
the middle there but it ended
okay, mild pain."

683
41:24
It turns out,
in general, endings matter a

684
41:27
lot.
Kahneman did his research with

685
41:30
– both in a laboratory where
you could make – give people

686
41:33
mild pain by getting them to
stick their hand in freezing

687
41:37
cold water and with people
undergoing extremely painful

688
41:40
colonoscopy procedures.
And it turns out that if you

689
41:44
want to give people a good
memory, or a less bad memory,

690
41:48
of a horrible event topping
them off with some mild pain

691
41:53
will do the trick.
In the end, endings matter.

692
41:58
Both of these examples,
a party that's hugely fun for

693
42:02
ninety percent,
then the last ten percent

694
42:05
somebody slaps you in the face
and pours dip on you or

695
42:09
something-- [laughter]
So,

696
42:11
ninety percent of good stuff,
ten percent bad stuff,

697
42:15
versus ninety percent people
are slapping you and pouring dip

698
42:19
on you [laughter]
but then ten percent,

699
42:22
whoa, that was a really
good--when you think back on it,

700
42:26
if you just added it up,
"A" would be much better but

701
42:31
"B" has this huge pull because
of the power of how things end

702
42:38
so endings matter.
So, I'm going to end things now.

703
42:43
I'm first going to do a few
things.

704
42:45
Before saying anything more,
I want to thank the teaching

705
42:48
fellows.
There's Sunny Bang,

706
42:50
Erik Cheries,
Jane Erickson,

707
42:52
Izzat Jarudi,
Greg Laun, and Koleen McCrink.

708
42:55
I think they did a superb job.
[applause]

709
43:02
We've basically reviewed all
the psychology.

710
43:10
Here is a promissory note we
started with at the beginning of

711
43:14
this semester.
I think you are now in a

712
43:17
position to answer or at least
consider answers about these

713
43:23
topics,
about topics such as dreams,

714
43:25
testimony, disgust,
memory, depression,

715
43:28
language,
humor, and even a little bit

716
43:31
about good and evil.
This is an--a broad intro

717
43:35
survey class,
and the field of psychology is

718
43:38
broad and we've just gotten
started.

719
43:42
If you're interested,
this is a great department.

720
43:46
There are some amazing scholars
here and some amazing teachers

721
43:50
and there are courses that go
into detail about just about

722
43:53
every topic I talked about.
If you're interested in memory

723
43:58
or social interaction or mental
illness, I could point you to

724
44:02
some great courses.
I'm not taking any sophomore

725
44:05
advisees next year because I'm
on leave in the fall but you

726
44:08
should feel free to come talk to
me if you want any specific

727
44:12
advice or suggestions.
Now, I know not all of you are

728
44:16
going to end up majoring in
psychology.

729
44:19
Some of you will choose
cognitive science instead

730
44:22
[laughter]
but on a more serious note I

731
44:25
know for some of you this is the
last--maybe the first but the

732
44:29
last psychology class you'll
ever take.

733
44:32
And so I want to close this
course by emphasizing two

734
44:36
themes.
The first one is a bit of

735
44:40
humility.
There are some very basic

736
44:42
questions about the mind – and
I've tried to be honest about

737
44:46
this throughout the
course--There are some very

738
44:48
basic questions about the mind
that nobody knows the answer to

739
44:51
yet.
We know the brain is the source

740
44:54
of mental life but we don't have
any understanding at all about

741
44:58
exactly how this happens,
about how a physical object,

742
45:01
a lump of meat,
can give rise to conscious

743
45:04
experience.
We know that about half of the

744
45:07
variants in personality,
about half the differences

745
45:09
between people,
are due to genetic factors but

746
45:12
we don't know how to explain
where the other half happens.

747
45:16
It has to be experienced but we
have no real good theories of

748
45:20
the sort of experience that
makes one person adventurous and

749
45:24
another one timid,
one bitter and one satisfied.

750
45:28
We know a lot about the social
influences that can drive people

751
45:32
to do terrible things to one
another but we don't know the

752
45:36
answer to the maybe harder
question of why some of us--some

753
45:39
people are immune to these
influences,

754
45:42
why some people do good things,
perhaps even heroic things,

755
45:46
regardless of the circumstances
that they find themselves in.

756
45:50
So, there's an enormous amount
left to do.

757
45:53
It's an exciting field just
because there's just so much

758
45:57
more we need to understand.
The second theme is more

759
46:01
optimistic.
And this is the idea that we're

760
46:03
going to eventually come to
answer these questions and many

761
46:07
more questions through the sorts
of methods we've been discussing

762
46:11
this semester,
through constructing scientific

763
46:14
theories,
evolution--evolutionary,

764
46:16
neurological,
developmental,

765
46:18
computational and testing them
through experimental and

766
46:22
observational methods.
This is the idea that,

767
46:25
in the end, the most important
and intimate aspects of

768
46:29
ourselves,
our beliefs and emotions,

769
46:31
our capacities to make
decisions, even our sense of

770
46:34
right and wrong can be explained
through constructing and testing

771
46:37
scientific hypotheses.
Now, the reason why I'm

772
46:40
optimistic is I think there's
been some success stories where

773
46:43
we really have learned some
surprising and important things

774
46:46
about the mind and there's no
reason to expect this way of

775
46:49
proceeding to fail us in the
future.

776
46:51
In my very--in the very first
class on the brain I ended by

777
46:56
talking about people's worries
here,

778
46:58
and I'll be honest,
that some people find it a

779
47:02
scary prospect.
Some people believe that a

780
47:05
scientific approach to the mind
takes the "special-ness" away

781
47:09
from people, that it diminishes
us somehow.

782
47:12
And I don't agree.
If there's anything I've tried

783
47:16
to persuade you through the
course, it's that the more you

784
47:19
look at the mind and how it
works from a serious scientific

785
47:22
point of view the more you come
to appreciate its complexities,

786
47:25
uniqueness, and its beauty.
This has been a great course to

787
47:29
teach.
Thank you for coming and good

788
47:32
luck on the Final.
