Professor Paul Bloom:
So what we're doing today is

2
0:15
continuing on the theme of
emotions.

3
0:17
"Emotions" is a two-part
lecture and we're continuing

4
0:21
along certain themes.
I want to begin by responding

5
0:25
to a question which was raised
in the last class concerning

6
0:29
smiling and nonhuman primates.
It was a very good question.

7
0:33
The issue was:
we know that humans have

8
0:36
different sorts of smiles to
convey different sorts of

9
0:39
information.
The question was,

10
0:41
"do nonhuman primates,
like chimpanzees or gorillas or

11
0:45
gibbons, have the same many
sorts of smiles?"

12
0:48
So, I contacted the world's
expert on smiling,

13
0:50
who did not return my e-mails.
So, I contacted the second

14
0:54
world's expert on smiling who
told me that the answer is "no,"

15
0:59
that primate--nonhuman primate
smiles actually correspond

16
1:04
almost entirely to appeasement
smiles.

17
1:07
They're "don't hurt me" smiles.
They're equivalent to the "coy

18
1:11
smile" that we saw on humans.
But that nonhuman primates do

19
1:15
not use smiles for greetings;
there's no equivalent to the

20
1:19
"greeting smile" or "Pan Am
smile";

21
1:21
nor do they use them as genuine
expressions of happiness.

22
1:24
There's no equivalent to the
"Duchenne smile."

23
1:27
That's as far as I know.
If the world's expert gets back

24
1:30
to me and says something
different, I'll keep you posted.

25
1:33
Another thing.
Going back to the beginning

26
1:37
theme of the class,
what we started--just to

27
1:39
review, we talked about the
different functions of emotions.

28
1:41
And then we talked about
smiling and facial expressions.

29
1:44
And then we turned to some--to
a nonsocial emotion,

30
1:47
the case of fear.
And then we shifted to social

31
1:50
emotions.
And we talked about social

32
1:52
emotions towards kin and the
special evolutionary reasons

33
1:55
that would lead them to evolve.
And as we were ending,

34
1:59
we were talking about the
relationship between an animal

35
2:03
and its children,
particularly in cases like

36
2:07
humans and birds and mammals
where there tends to be a close

37
2:11
relationship with our children.
We invest in quality,

38
2:15
not quantity.
I might produce very few

39
2:18
children in my life.
And my evolutionary trick then

40
2:23
is to focus very intently on
them and make sure they survive.

41
2:28
If I were to produce 100
children, I could stand to lose

42
2:31
a few, but if I just produce
five in my lifetime or two or

43
2:35
one,
they become very precious to me.

44
2:37
And so, the story of the
evolution of a species like us

45
2:41
involves a long period of
dependence and deep,

46
2:44
deep bonds between the parent
and the child.

47
2:48
And that's part of what I
talked about,

48
2:49
how parents respond to
children.

49
2:51
And I want to begin this class
by giving an illustration from a

50
2:55
documentary about parental
response to children,

51
2:58
but I want to give it in a
species that's not us.

52
3:01
And here is why.
I'll explain why with an

53
3:05
analogy.
I have a friend of mine who

54
3:07
studies the psychology of
religion.

55
3:10
He studies why people hold
religious beliefs.

56
3:12
And he tells me that when he's
talking to a non specialist,

57
3:16
somebody not in the field,
he doesn't ever tell them,

58
3:20
"Yeah, I'm really interested in
why people believe in the Bible

59
3:24
or why people light the candles
on Sabbath or why people go to

60
3:28
church" because these are
religions that people around

61
3:31
here hold,
and if you tell people you

62
3:34
study them they'll sort of be
puzzled, "why would you want to

63
3:37
study something like that" or
offended.

64
3:39
If you want to talk about the
psychology of religion to an

65
3:42
audience like this,
what you do is you start with

66
3:45
the exotic.
So, you start by talking about

67
3:48
people who put butter on their
heads.

68
3:50
Dan Sperber talks about a
culture where the men put butter

69
3:53
on their heads in the summer.
And it kind of melts and that's

70
3:56
part of--one of the things that
they do or--you talk about a

71
3:59
culture that believes in spirits
or that trees can talk.

72
4:03
You say you're studying it and
they say, "Oh,

73
4:05
that's interesting.
I wonder why they believe that?"

74
4:07
And you use that as a way to
look at more general facts that

75
4:11
exist even in our culture.
You use the fact that we don't

76
4:15
take the exotic for granted as a
way to motivate the scientific

77
4:19
study of things we do take for
granted.

78
4:22
And this is,
of course, true more generally.

79
4:25
This was the point in the
William James quote when he

80
4:27
talked about things that are
natural to us and noticed that

81
4:30
some very odd things are equally
natural to other species.

82
4:33
And it's true,
I think, in particular when we

83
4:36
talk about things like the love
we have for our children.

84
4:39
So, one way to look at the love
we have for our children

85
4:42
scientifically,
isn't to look at it head-on,

86
4:45
because the love we feel
towards our own children feels

87
4:48
sacred, it feels special,
but look at it in other species.

88
4:51
And so, one of the nicest
illustrations of this is the

89
4:55
Emperor penguin,
which was--which--whose

90
4:58
childcare and mating practices
were dramatized in a wonderful

91
5:02
movie called "March of the
Penguins."

92
5:05
And this is interesting because
they had this incredibly

93
5:09
elaborate and quite precarious
system of generating and taking

94
5:13
care of offspring.
So, I want to show you a brief

95
5:16
clip of the movie to illustrate
some parts of this.

96
5:19
What they do at the beginning,
which is not--which leads up to

97
5:23
this, is they take a very long
trek from the water to their

98
5:26
breeding grounds.
Their breeding grounds is--are

99
5:29
protected from the wind and
they're on a firm piece of ice

100
5:32
so they could hold the whole
pack.

101
5:34
They do the breeding there and
it's there that the eggs are

102
5:37
created.
So, this is where the movie

103
5:41
begins at this point.
"March of the Penguins" was the

104
5:46
second best--second most popular
documentary of all time,

105
5:50
beaten only by "Fahrenheit
9/11."

106
5:52
And people responded to it in
different ways,

107
5:55
which are informative when we
think about the generalizations

108
5:59
you could make from animal
behavior to human behavior.

109
6:03
Some conservative commentators
saw this as a celebration of

110
6:08
family values,
such as love and trust and

111
6:12
monogamy.
Some liberals,

112
6:14
who hate everything that's good
and true, [laughter]

113
6:18
responded by saying,
"Well, yeah,

114
6:20
they're monogamous for one
breeding season.

115
6:24
It's a year.
Then they go and find another

116
6:26
mate.
If you add it up,

117
6:28
it's pretty slutty."
[laughter]

118
6:31
I think more to the point,
people were impressed and

119
6:35
stunned by the rich and
articulate and systematic

120
6:39
behavior that these animals were
showing.

121
6:42
Plainly, they didn't pick it up
from television,

122
6:45
movies, culture,
learning, schooling,

123
6:46
and so on.
To some extent,

124
6:48
this sort of complicated
behavior came natural to them.

125
6:51
And it's understandable that
some proponents of intelligent

126
6:56
design, or creationism,
pointed to this as an example

127
7:00
of how God creates things that
are deeply, richly intricate so

128
7:04
as to perpetrate the survival of
different animals.

129
7:08
From a Darwinian standpoint,
the Darwinian would agree with

130
7:11
the creationist that this
couldn't have happened by

131
7:14
accident,
this is just far too

132
7:16
complicated, but would appeal to
the--to this as an exquisite

133
7:20
example of a biological
adaptation,

134
7:23
in particular a biological
adaptation regarding parental

135
7:27
care to children shaped by the
fact that children share the

136
7:31
parents' genes and so parents
will evolve in ways that

137
7:35
perpetrate the survival of their
children.

138
7:39
Then there's the other
direction, which is how children

139
7:43
respond to parents,
how the young ones are wired up

140
7:48
to resonate and respond in
different ways to the adults

141
7:52
around them.
And we quickly talked about

142
7:55
some different theories of this.
And I'll just review what we

143
7:59
talked about last class.
Babies will develop an

144
8:03
attachment to whoever is
closest.

145
8:05
They'll usually prefer their
mothers because their mothers

146
8:09
are typically those who are
closest to them.

147
8:11
They'll prefer her voice,
her face, her smell.

148
8:14
It used to be thought that
there is some sort of magical

149
8:18
moment of imprinting that when
the baby is born,

150
8:21
the baby must see his or her
mother and "boom," a connection

151
8:25
is made.
If the baby doesn't,

152
8:26
terrible things will happen
with attachment later on.

153
8:29
This is silly.
There is no reason to believe

154
8:32
there's some special moment or
special five minutes or special

155
8:35
hour.
It's just in the fullness of

156
8:37
time babies will develop an
attachment to the animal that's

157
8:41
closest to it.
They will recognize it as,

158
8:44
at an implicit level,
at an unconscious level,

159
8:47
as their kin.
Well, how does this work?

160
8:50
How does the baby's brain
develop--come to develop an

161
8:54
emotional attachment to that
creature?

162
8:57
Well, you remember from Skinner
that operant conditioning could

163
9:01
provide a good answer to this.
And this is known as the

164
9:05
"Cupboard Theory," which is
babies love their moms because

165
9:08
their moms provide food.
It's the law of effect.

166
9:12
It's operant conditioning.
They will approach their

167
9:14
mothers to get the food from
them.

168
9:17
And they will develop an
attachment because their mother

169
9:20
provides food.
And this is contrasted with a

170
9:23
more nativist,
hard-wired theory developed by

171
9:27
Bowlby which claims that there's
two things going on.

172
9:31
There is a draw to mom for
comfort and social interaction

173
9:36
and fear of strangers.
Now, in the real world,

174
9:39
it's difficult to pull apart
these two means of attraction

175
9:44
because the very same woman
who's giving you comfort and

176
9:48
social interaction is also the
one giving you milk.

177
9:53
But in the laboratory you can
pull them apart.

178
9:56
And that's what Henry Harlow
did in the movies you saw last

179
10:00
week.
So, Harlow exposed primates to

180
10:02
two different mothers.
One is a wire mother.

181
10:06
That's a Skinnerian mother.
That's a mother who gave food.

182
10:08
The other is a cloth mother
set-up so that she'd be

183
10:12
comfortable and give warmth and
cuddling.

184
10:16
And the question is,
"Which one do babies go for?"

185
10:18
And as you can remember from
the movies, the results are

186
10:21
fairly decisive.
Babies go to the wire mother to

187
10:25
eat--as one of the characters
said, "You've got to eat to

188
10:29
live."
But they viewed the--they loved

189
10:32
the cloth mother.
They developed an attachment to

190
10:36
the warm, cuddly mother.
That's the one they used as a

191
10:39
base when they were threatened.
That's the one they used as a

192
10:42
base from which to explore.
Okay.

193
10:48
And that actually--Oh,
that's just--I have a picture.

194
10:52
And that actually takes me to
the--Oh, except for one thing,

195
10:56
it almost takes me to the end
of the question of our emotions

196
11:00
towards kin.
One question you could ask is,

197
11:03
"What if there's no contact at
all?"

198
11:05
Now, you could imagine the
effects of how--A lot of people

199
11:11
are interested in the question
of the effects of the child's

200
11:17
early relationship to adults
around him or her in how the

201
11:22
child turns out later.
This becomes hugely relevant

202
11:27
for social debates like daycare.
So for instance,

203
11:30
a lot of psychologists are
interested in the question,

204
11:34
"Is it better for a child to be
raised by a parent,

205
11:37
usually a mother,
or does it make a difference if

206
11:41
the child goes to daycare?
What if the child goes to

207
11:45
daycare at six months?
What if the child goes to

208
11:47
daycare at two years?
How does this affect the child?"

209
11:50
The short answer is,
nobody really knows.

210
11:55
There's a lot of debate over
whether or not there are subtle

211
11:58
differences and it's deeply
controversial.

212
12:00
But we do know that it doesn't
make a big difference.

213
12:04
We do know that if you got
raised by mom,

214
12:07
or perhaps mom and dad,
or maybe just dad all through

215
12:11
your life until going off for
school and I--my parents threw

216
12:15
me in a daycare at age three
months--it's not going to make a

217
12:19
big difference for us,
maybe a subtle difference

218
12:23
though it's not clear which way
it would go.

219
12:25
But it won't make a big
difference.

220
12:26
But what if there's no contact
at all?

221
12:29
What if--What about terrible
circumstances where people get

222
12:34
no cloth mother,
they get nobody for attachment?

223
12:38
This is a really--In the real
world, of course,

224
12:42
you can't do experiments on
this.

225
12:45
And in the real world with
humans, this only happens in

226
12:48
tragic cases.
But this has been studied.

227
12:52
So Harlow, again,
raised monkeys in solitary

228
12:57
confinement so they were raised
in steel cages with only a wire

229
13:05
mother.
In other words,

230
13:07
they got all the nutrition they
needed but they got no

231
13:10
mothering.
It turned out that you kind of

232
13:14
get monkey psychotics.
They're withdrawn.

233
13:19
They don't play.
They bite themselves.

234
13:22
They're incompetent sexually.
They're incompetent socially.

235
13:27
They're incompetent maternally.
In one case,

236
13:30
one of these monkeys raised in
solitary confinement was

237
13:32
artificially inseminated.
When she had a child she banged

238
13:37
its head on the floor and then
bit it to death.

239
13:41
So, you need to be--you
need--This shows--This is kind

240
13:46
of a stark demonstration that
some early connection,

241
13:51
some early attachment is
critical for the developing of a

242
13:55
primate.
Obviously, you don't do these

243
13:57
experiments with people but
there are natural experiments,

244
14:02
humans raised in harsh
orphanages with little social

245
14:06
contact, and these children--If
the--In other words,

246
14:10
they get fed,
barely, but nobody picks them

247
14:13
up and cuddles them.
These children,

248
14:15
if this happens for long
enough, they end up with severe

249
14:19
problems with social and
emotional development.

250
14:23
From an emotional point of
view, they're often insatiable.

251
14:26
They really need cuddling and
support or they're apathetic,

252
14:30
they don't care at all.
Now, there's some sort of good

253
14:33
news, which is if you get these
people or these monkeys early

254
14:37
enough you can reverse the
effects of this bad development.

255
14:41
So, there's some research done
with monkey therapists.

256
14:45
So then, what they do is they
take the monkey,

257
14:47
they raise it in a steel cage,
the monkey comes out,

258
14:49
the monkey is kind of psycho,
and then they send in a younger

259
14:52
monkey who is just goofing
around,

260
14:54
jumping all around the place
and everything.

261
14:56
And experience with this
younger monkey who just follows

262
15:00
them around and clings to them
leads to gradual improvement.

263
15:05
It makes the solitary monkey
become better.

264
15:08
There might be a similar effect
with humans.

265
15:11
So one story more about--of an
anecdote than an experiment was

266
15:15
a situation where at the age of
one and a half,

267
15:18
children were taken away from a
really harsh orphanage where

268
15:22
they had no contact and brought
into a home for mentally

269
15:26
retarded women where these women
gave them plenty of contact and

270
15:31
cuddling and apparently,
from what we know,

271
15:34
brought them back to normal.
And this is all I want to talk

272
15:38
about, about the emotions we
feel towards our kin,

273
15:41
towards our children,
and towards our parents.

274
15:44
Any questions or thoughts?

275
15:45


276
15:53
Yes.
Student: Do children in

277
15:56
orphanages comfort each other?
Professor Paul Bloom:

278
15:59
It's a good question.
Do children in orphanages

279
16:01
comfort each other?
I don't know.

280
16:04
The situation probably wouldn't
be there--The problem is

281
16:07
children in orphanages who are
in these terrible situations

282
16:10
tend to be babies and very young
and they wouldn't be thrown

283
16:13
together in situations where
they could comfort each other.

284
16:16
It's a really interesting
question.

285
16:18
What if it was a situation
where children were raised

286
16:21
without a supportive cloth
mother at all,

287
16:23
would not be able to pick them
up and hold them,

288
16:25
but they could play amongst
themselves and support each

289
16:28
other?
I don't know the answer to that.

290
16:31
Teaching Assistant: Yes.
Professor Paul Bloom:

291
16:33
Yes?
Is there evidence on that?

292
16:35
Teaching Assistant: Yes,
there is.

293
16:37
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

294
16:39
Yes.
[laughter]

295
16:40
The answer is there is
evidence, [laughs]

296
16:43
as everybody knows,
[laughter]

297
16:45
that this sort of--amongst the
young,

298
16:47
support can actually help the
monkey and the children.

299
16:52
Somebody else had a question
here?

300
16:57
Yes.
Student: What does that

301
17:00
tell us about the middle ground,
if the parent is comforting

302
17:03
just a little bit and then not
that much [inaudible]

303
17:06
Professor Paul Bloom:
Right.

304
17:09
So this is--The question is,
"What does that tell us about

305
17:11
the middle ground?"
So this is an extreme case but

306
17:13
what do we know about the middle
case?

307
17:15
Say your parent--You're not
raised in a cage,

308
17:18
you're not in a Romanian
orphanage, but your parents just

309
17:21
don't pick you up very much.
They don't love you very much.

310
17:24
There's no good evidence that
that has any effect on a person.

311
17:29
The problem is,
and we're going to talk about

312
17:31
this in much more detail in a
couple of weeks,

313
17:33
is it's true that parents who
aren't affectionate have kids

314
17:37
that aren't affectionate but
it's not clear this is because

315
17:42
of a genetic connection or an
environmental connection.

316
17:46
The one thing we do know is
that in the middle ground,

317
17:49
effects tend not to be
dramatic.

318
17:51
So when you get away from
extreme cases,

319
17:53
effects are hard to see and
require careful experimental

320
17:57
research to tease out.
I think what it's safe to say

321
18:00
for a lot--for everything but
the severe conditions is we

322
18:03
don't know what kind of effects
there are.

323
18:06
But if there are effects they
are not big and dramatic ones.

324
18:09


325
18:14
Okay.
Animals' good feelings,

326
18:17
animals' emotional attraction
to their kin,

327
18:20
is not a huge puzzle from an
evolutionary point of view.

328
18:24
Evolution is driven by forces
that operate on the fact of how

329
18:30
many genes get reproduced and
replicated among your

330
18:35
descendants.
So, it makes sense that animals

331
18:39
would be wired-up to care for
their kids.

332
18:42
It would make sense that kids
who are wired-up to survive

333
18:45
would develop attachments to
their parents.

334
18:48
What's more of a puzzle though
is that animals,

335
18:52
including humans,
seem to have exquisitely

336
18:55
complicated relationships with
non-kin.

337
18:59
In particular,
animals are nice to non-kin.

338
19:02
You are nice to people that
you're not related to.

339
19:06
There are a lot of examples of
this.

340
19:07
Animals groom one another.
You go, you pick off the lice

341
19:12
and the bugs off your friend;
they pick it off you.

342
19:15
They give warning cries.
So, warning cries--All sorts of

343
19:21
animals give warning cries.
You are--I don't know.

344
19:26
You're a little animal and a
big animal comes charging and

345
19:29
you say, "Hey!"
Oh.

346
19:31
You may sort of cry and
everybody runs away.

347
19:34
And that's very risky for you
but you do it anyway,

348
19:37
often to protect people you
aren't related to.

349
19:40
Often animals share childcare.
And from a cold-blooded,

350
19:44
natural selection,
survival-of-the-gene point of

351
19:47
view,
you would imagine that if you

352
19:49
lend me your kid for the day I
would eat him for the protein

353
19:53
and "it's not my genes and
actually it gives more for my

354
19:57
kids."
That's not quite how it works

355
19:59
though.
Animals share food.

356
20:03
In fact, that animal,
hugely ugly,

357
20:07
the vampire bat,
shares food.

358
20:11
What happens is the vampire
bat--vampire bats live in caves

359
20:16
and they fly out.
And what they do is often a bat

360
20:19
will strike it big.
She'll find a horse,

361
20:22
for instance,
bite the horse,

362
20:24
pump in tons of blood and then
fly back.

363
20:27
And what it does is it doesn't
keep it to itself.

364
20:30
Rather, it goes around the
whole cave and vomits blood into

365
20:34
the mouth of all the other
vampire bats so everybody

366
20:37
benefits.
Isn't that nice?

367
20:42
[laughter]
Now, what you're tempted to say

368
20:45
is, "Well, that's really nice.
Everybody benefits," but this

369
20:49
raises a puzzle from the
evolutionary point of view.

370
20:52
Remember, animals benefit more,
and to this situation,

371
20:57
animals benefit more by working
together than by working alone.

372
21:02
The benefits outweigh the costs.
This is known as "reciprocal

373
21:06
altruism" meaning my behavior to
you, my good behavior to you,

374
21:11
my altruism for you,
is predicated on the idea of

375
21:14
reciprocation,
"I'll benefit from you."

376
21:16
And you imagine how vampire
bats, for instance,

377
21:19
why this makes sense.
This is--If you're a vampire

378
21:22
bat, it's a better system when
anybody strikes it big to feed

379
21:26
you rather than for anybody who
strike it big,

380
21:29
use the blood and then spit out
all the rest of it.

381
21:32
But here's the problem.
Here's why it's such a puzzle.

382
21:35
The problem is the existence of
cheaters.

383
21:39
And in economics and sociology
these are also known as

384
21:43
"free-riders."
And what a cheater or

385
21:47
free-rider does is it takes the
benefits without paying the

386
21:53
cost.
Imagine two genes.

387
21:56
Imagine one builds a vampire
bat that accepts blood from

388
22:00
others and shares blood.
The other gene accepts blood

389
22:04
from others and doesn't share
blood.

390
22:07
In the long run,
"B" will actually out-produce

391
22:11
gene "A" because in fact,
"B" will be healthy while other

392
22:16
vampire bats get sick.
And then so the offspring will

393
22:21
do better.
An even sharper example is an

394
22:24
example of warning cries.
So, gophers give warning cries

395
22:28
when there's a predator.
It is extremely adaptive to

396
22:31
give a warning cry.
Sorry.

397
22:34
It's extremely adaptive to
respond to a warning cry.

398
22:37
You hear a warning cry,
you-- "Oh, crap," you run away.

399
22:39
It is not very adaptive to give
a warning cry.

400
22:45
A really good solution then is
to listen to warning cries but

401
22:49
not to give them.
Suppose we had a system--It is

402
22:53
very adaptive when people are
going to the bar,

403
22:57
when people buy drinks to
accept the drinks.

404
23:01
It is not so adaptive,
from the standpoint of one's

405
23:05
wallet, to buy people drinks.
Here is a solution.

406
23:09
Accept drinks but don't pay for
drinks.

407
23:12
And if everybody fell to that
solution, the idea of buying a

408
23:16
round would fade.
So, there is the puzzle.

409
23:19
Since cheating--Since a
cheater, in the short run,

410
23:22
can always out-win--does better
than a non-cheater,

411
23:26
how could this cooperation
evolve?

412
23:28
How could it be an
evolutionarily stable strategy?

413
23:31
And the answer is "cheater
detection."

414
23:35
Reciprocal altruism can only
evolve if animals are wired up

415
23:40
to punish cheaters.
Now, that requires a lot of

416
23:44
mental apparatus.
You have to recognize cheaters,

417
23:46
you have to remember cheaters,
and you have to be motivated to

418
23:49
punish cheaters.
And not every animal has this

419
23:53
degree of complicated apparatus
but actually we know that

420
23:58
vampire bats do.
So, in one clever study--So the

421
24:02
theory says--the evolutionary
theory says "yeah,

422
24:05
I see what these vampire bats
are doing," but you see--and

423
24:08
this is a case where evolution
makes a nice prediction that

424
24:11
couldn't evolve unless bats are
keeping track.

425
24:14
If bats aren't keeping track,
then the system could never

426
24:18
exist because the cheaters would
just take it over.

427
24:21
They must be watching for
cheaters.

428
24:23
So, the experiment which was
done is you--a vampire bat

429
24:27
strikes it big,
it flies back,

430
24:29
and then you keep it--as a
scientist you keep it from

431
24:33
giving blood to anybody else.
Then what happens?

432
24:38
Well, what happens is when the
other bats strike it big they

433
24:43
starve the selfish bat,
just as if we go to bars and

434
24:47
everybody buys a round except
for me.

435
24:51
And this happens over and over
and over again.

436
24:53
Pretty soon you're going to buy
a round but you're not going to

437
24:56
give me one.
And so, just as humans are

438
24:58
keeping their eyes out for
people who are taking the

439
25:00
benefits without paying the
costs, so are other animals.

440
25:04
And it is argued that this
sensitivity to cheating,

441
25:09
this focus on reciprocation,
plays a powerful role in the

442
25:15
evolution of social behavior and
the evolution of social

443
25:19
emotions.
And a classic illustration of

444
25:23
this is The Prisoner's Dilemma.
Now, many of you,

445
25:27
I think, have seen The
Prisoner's Dilemma in one course

446
25:30
or another?
It shows up--It is one of the

447
25:32
main constructs in the social
sciences.

448
25:35
It shows up in cognitive
science, psychology,

449
25:38
economics, that you could--The
teaching fellows are passing

450
25:41
around something which you're
not going to use right away.

451
25:45
But for some of you this is the
first time you're going to be

452
25:47
exposed to The Prisoner's
Dilemma so let me spell it out.

453
25:50
Here's the idea.
You and a friend commit a crime.

454
25:56
You rob a bank, for instance.
For the sake of this example,

455
26:00
you are prisoner two.
You get caught.

456
26:05
The police put you in a little
room and they say,

457
26:08
"We want to know everything
that happened.

458
26:12
In particular,
we want you to rat out your

459
26:14
friend."
Now, here are the options,

460
26:17
and one thing about this is
nothing is hidden.

461
26:21
The police officer could
actually print out a copy of The

462
26:24
Prisoner's Dilemma and put it
right in front of you.

463
26:27
And what he could say is,
"Look."

464
26:28
You're prisoner two.
"You could cooperate--Well,

465
26:33
you have two options.
You could either cooperate with

466
26:37
your friend, you could stay
silent, or you could defect or

467
26:42
you could squeal."
But the police officer says,

468
26:46
"Look.
If you--Let me tell you

469
26:49
something.
If you cooperate with your

470
26:52
friend and he squeals on you,
you'll go to prison for life

471
26:57
and he'll walk out.
However, if you squeal on him

472
27:02
and he cooperates,
he keeps quiet,

473
27:06
he'll go to prison for life and
you'll walk out."

474
27:11
So, what do you do?
Now, on the nice side,

475
27:15
what you can do is you could
say, "No.

476
27:17
I'm going to be quiet.
I'm going to cooperate."

477
27:20
Now, if you could trust your
friend to cooperate,

478
27:23
you're fine,
you each get a little stint in

479
27:25
prison, but of course your
friend might defect.

480
27:28
Your friend might squeal.
Here is the important structure

481
27:34
of The Prisoner's Dilemma.
No matter what you--what your

482
27:38
friend chooses to do,
you're better off squealing.

483
27:43
So, suppose you're prisoner two.
You believe your friend's going

484
27:47
to cooperate with you.
He's not going to be--he's not

485
27:49
going to give the information
out.

486
27:51
Well, then your best thing to
do is squeal on him.

487
27:53


488
27:56
What if you believe he's going
to squeal on you?

489
28:00
Well, your best thing to do is
squeal on him but if you could

490
28:04
get your act together and you
could coordinate this,

491
28:09
you would both be quiet and get
a fairly minor penalty.

492
28:13
And you could see this--This is
the standard origin of the

493
28:16
prisoner's dilemma,
why it's called "The Prisoner's

494
28:19
Dilemma," but you could see this
all over the place.

495
28:21
So, here is the logic.
The best case for you is to

496
28:25
defect while the other person
cooperates.

497
28:28
The worst case is to cooperate
while the other person defects.

498
28:32
Back to the police thing.
The best case for you is to

499
28:34
give up all the information;
the other guy stays silent;

500
28:37
you cut a deal;
you walk home that day.

501
28:39
The worst case is you're quiet,
he cuts a deal,

502
28:42
you go to prison for life,
but overall the best is that

503
28:46
each cooperate and overall the
worst for both is if each

504
28:49
defect.
And the reason that makes this

505
28:52
tragic is this.
Regardless of what your

506
28:55
opponent does,
it pays to defect,

507
28:57
but if both people defect both
are worse off.

508
29:01
I'll give a couple of other
examples.

509
29:03
No.
That's just to show that

510
29:05
there's a cartoon corresponding
to The Prisoner's Dilemma.

511
29:08
It is that common.
Here's the idea.

512
29:11
I am--I break up with my wife.
We've been married for a while.

513
29:16
We've decided we're not going
to go through it together

514
29:19
anymore and we break up.
We're living in separate houses

515
29:23
and we're starting to talk
divorce.

516
29:25
It occurs to me--Here's me.
I put that out there.

517
29:30
"Should I get a divorce lawyer?"
I ask.

518
29:32
Now, I know divorce lawyers are
really expensive.

519
29:36
And it's kind of difficult to
get a divorce lawyer.

520
29:39
But if I get a divorce
lawyer--And so neither one of us

521
29:44
get a divorce lawyer we'll just
do okay.

522
29:47
We'll get a mediator.
We'll split the money down the

523
29:49
middle.
That'll be okay but I'm kind of

524
29:51
tempted.
If I get a divorce lawyer and

525
29:55
she doesn't, my divorce lawyer
will take everything she's got.

526
30:00
I get everything,
she loses everything.

527
30:03
Maybe I should be nice.
Hold it.

528
30:06
What if she gets a divorce
lawyer and I don't?

529
30:09
Well, then I'll lose
everything, she'll get

530
30:12
everything.
Well, we should both get a

531
30:16
divorce lawyer then but we'd
both do pretty badly.

532
30:20
Imagine we're two countries,
country "A" and country "B."

533
30:22
Should I do nuclear disarmament?
That's pretty good.

534
30:26
We'd do okay if both countries
disarmed.

535
30:29
We would live our lives;
we'll raise taxes;

536
30:32
we'll do whatever countries do.
But wouldn't it be cool if I

537
30:37
build up my weaponry and they
don't?

538
30:40
I'll invade,
take everything they got.

539
30:42
That's kind of tempting.
Uh oh.

540
30:45
Also, if I don't do anything
and they do it,

541
30:47
they'll invade my country,
take everything.

542
30:50
So, we both build up our
weaponry and we both do pretty

543
30:53
badly.
Once you start thinking about

544
30:55
things this way,
there's no end to the sort of

545
30:58
notions that could fall under
The Prisoner's Dilemma.

546
31:01
A good example is a drug deal.
Suppose I want to buy marijuana

547
31:06
from you, or "reefer" as they
call it on the street.

548
31:12
[laughter]
So, I have $1,000 and from you

549
31:18
I'd like to buy a ton of reefer
so--I'm rounding off.

550
31:27
[laughter]
So, you say,

551
31:28
"Wonderful.
Wonderful.

552
31:29
Let's meet behind the gym,
two in the morning on Friday,

553
31:33
and we'll do the exchange.
You bring $1,000,

554
31:36
I bring the reefer."
"Oh, cool.

555
31:39
Okay.
Good."

556
31:40
And I think,
"that's pretty good,

557
31:41
a thousand bucks,
I get the reefer,

558
31:43
you get a thousand bucks.
That's okay,

559
31:45
that's the normal thing."
But now something occurs to me.

560
31:48
"Nobody's going to go to the
cops if things go badly.

561
31:52
So instead of doing--bringing
the money, why don't I just

562
31:56
bring a gun?
You come with your reefer,

563
31:58
I stick a gun in your face,
take the reefer,

564
32:00
go home."
Maybe I won't do that,

565
32:02
but now I worry because you're
thinking the same thing.

566
32:06
So, you could show up with a
gun, stick the gun in my face,

567
32:10
take the thousand bucks,
go home.

568
32:12
I'll have no reefer.
What will I smoke?

569
32:17
[laughter]
So, we both think this way.

570
32:19
So, we both show up behind the
gym, two in the morning,

571
32:23
with guns.
[laughter]

572
32:25
Well, that's not as bad for
either one of us if I

573
32:28
had--I--you had a gun and I
didn't have a gun.

574
32:32
But still, we're both worse off
than if we could cooperate and

575
32:36
just do the damn trade.
And so that's the structure of

576
32:40
The Prisoner's Dilemma.
You can only appreciate The

577
32:43
Prisoner's Dilemma by actually
doing it.

578
32:46
So, here's--here is a numerical
equivalent to The Prisoner's

579
32:51
Dilemma.
Everybody should have a card in

580
32:53
front of you,
a file card.

581
32:55
If you don't--If you didn't get
a card, a piece of paper will do

582
32:58
just as well.
Please write on one side

583
33:02
"cooperate" and on the other
side "defect" and then please

584
33:09
find a partner with whom to play
one game.

585
33:15
This is a one-shot game.

586
33:16


587
33:35
One of you is player one.
The player on the right-most

588
33:40
side from my right could be
player one.

589
33:43
The other one is player two.
Do you each have a partner?

590
33:45
If you have three people,
you could cluster together and

591
33:51
do two and then two and just
think.

592
33:54
It is actually best if you've
never met or spoken to the

593
33:57
person you're about to deal
with.

594
33:59
And the game is,
when I say "go," simply show

595
34:04
the person your choice.
To be clear,

596
34:07
if you are player one and you
cooperate and player two

597
34:10
cooperates as well,
you each get three dollars.

598
34:13
If you are player one and you
cooperate while player two

599
34:18
defects, player two gets five
dollars and you get bupkis and

600
34:23
so on.
On three, just show the card to

601
34:27
your opponent,
to your person you're playing

602
34:32
with.
One, two, three.

603
34:35
[laughter] Okay.
How many people in this room

604
34:49
cooperated?
How many cooperated?

605
34:54
How many defected?
[laughter] Okay.

606
34:58
How many people are now five
dollars richer?

607
35:01
Okay.
How many of you got nothing?

608
35:04
[laughter] Okay.
So, you're learning.

609
35:07
You're learning that the person
next to you is really an SOB.

610
35:13
[laughter]
Now, find the person next to

611
35:16
you and you get to play again.
And you get to play five games

612
35:21
in a row.
Play five games in a row and

613
35:25
keep score.
You just show it to each other,

614
35:29
record the numbers,
show it, show it,

615
35:32
show it, show it.
Go now.

616
35:36
[laughter]
Anybody here win twenty-five

617
35:39
dollars?
Yes, twenty-five?

618
35:42
So you-- Student 1: He
cooperated four times and I

619
35:46
defected-- Professor Paul
Bloom: That's twenty,

620
35:50
twenty-one.
[laughter] Okay.

621
35:52
That's good.
That's good.

622
35:54
So, it really is a measure of
honesty.

623
35:56
[laughs]
Anybody win twenty or more?

624
35:59
Fifteen or more.
Fourteen or less.

625
36:06
Anybody do five or less?
You're a good person.

626
36:11
It's good.
It's good.

627
36:13
You played it with him?
Student 2: Yes.

628
36:15
Professor Paul Bloom:
Bad person.

629
36:17
[laughter]
It's not really about good or

630
36:23
bad.
There was a great game once.

631
36:26
It's a simple game,
but it was a great game,

632
36:29
a great, famous competition a
long time ago,

633
36:32
about 20 years ago,
set up by the great computer

634
36:36
scientist Robert Axelrod.
And he put together a

635
36:40
competition where people brought
in computer programs to play

636
36:44
this game, to play The
Prisoner's Dilemma.

637
36:47
And there were sixty-three
competitors.

638
36:48
And these computer programs
were incredibly--Some of them

639
36:52
were very simple,
always be nice,

640
36:54
always be--always cooperate,
always defect.

641
36:57
Some were elegant,
prime number solutions and

642
37:00
prototype responses,
genetic algorithms crafted to

643
37:04
figure out what the other person
was doing and suss them out.

644
37:09
But the winner was developed by
Anatol Rappaport.

645
37:16
And Anatol Rappaport actually
died about a month ago at quite

646
37:21
an old age, a great scientist.
What was interesting about this

647
37:26
was he was the winner with his
program but his program was also

648
37:30
one of the simplest.
It may well have been the

649
37:34
simplest.
It was called "Tit-for-Tat" and

650
37:37
it worked very simple.
It took four lines of basic

651
37:41
code.
The first time you meet a new

652
37:44
program, cooperate.
The first time you meet

653
37:47
somebody, be nice.
After that, do on each trial

654
37:51
what the other program did on
the previous trial.

655
37:55
This beat sixty-two others.
And here is why.

656
38:00
It had certain beautiful
features.

657
38:02
It starts friendly.
Remember the best long-term

658
38:05
solution is everybody's
be--everybody's nice.

659
38:08
It starts off nice but you
can't--it's not a sucker.

660
38:12
If you screw with it,
it will defect back on the next

661
38:16
turn.
It is, however, forgiving.

662
38:20
Do you want to get nice with it?
Be nice.

663
38:23
If you're nice,
it'll be nice back at you later

664
38:26
on.
It's also transparent,

665
38:28
nothing complicated about it,
and that's actually important.

666
38:32
It's not merely that it's not a
sucker and forgiving.

667
38:35
More to the point,
it is--you could tell it's not

668
38:41
a sucker.
And you could tell it's

669
38:44
forgiving.
And this very powerful

670
38:46
algorithm learned to cooperate
even in the situation--and

671
38:50
helped--learned to make it out
the best even in a situation

672
38:54
where there's a risk of cheating
and betrayal.

673
38:58
Some psychologists have argued
that our emotions correspond to

674
39:04
the different permutations on
The Prisoner's Dilemma.

675
39:09
We like people who cooperate
with us.

676
39:11
This motivates us to be nice to
them in the future much as the

677
39:15
Tit-for-Tat algorithm says,
"If you are nice to me now,

678
39:19
I'll be nice to you back."
We don't like being screwed

679
39:23
with.
We feel anger and distrust

680
39:25
towards those who betray us.
That motivates us to betray or

681
39:28
avoid them in the future.
And we feel bad when we betray

682
39:31
somebody who cooperates with us.
This motivates us to behave

683
39:35
better in the future.
You can break down the cells of

684
39:39
The Prisoner's Dilemma in terms
of emotions that they give rise

685
39:44
to.
I did an experiment last night

686
39:46
with my seven-year-old and my
ten-year-old.

687
39:49
I explained to them The
Prisoner's Dilemma.

688
39:53
I didn't give the divorce
lawyer example but-- [laughter]

689
39:56
and we gave them a big thing of
chocolate chips and--the good

690
40:00
chocolate chips.
We had the good chips and we

691
40:03
had the matrix and we had them
play.

692
40:05
Now, what they did isn't so
interesting, but what's

693
40:09
interesting is they were furious
at each other.

694
40:13
One of them,
the younger boy,

695
40:15
was--kept being betrayed by the
older boy including tricks like

696
40:18
he'd say, "Okay.
Let's both cooperate."

697
40:21
"Yeah.
Okay."

698
40:22
Then he'd cooperate-- "defect!"
And [laughter]

699
40:26
the response was anger,
though not actually guilt on

700
40:33
the part of the other boy
[laughter]

701
40:37
but rage.
And we see these sort of things

702
40:42
all the time in real life.
You're familiar with The

703
40:45
Prisoner's Dilemma but there's
another game,

704
40:47
which you might not be familiar
with.

705
40:49
It's called The Ultimatum Game.
How many of you have

706
40:52
encountered The Ultimatum Game?
Okay, some of you.

707
40:56
Very simple.
Choose a partner.

708
40:58
It's a very simple game.
When economists study this they

709
41:01
actually do this with real
money.

710
41:04
I do not have real money to let
you do this too.

711
41:06
One of you is "A," one of you
is "B."

712
41:09
The one on the right most from
this side is "A."

713
41:13
The other one is "B."
Here is a very simple rule.

714
41:16
I'd like "A" to turn to "B" and
make an offer.

715
41:20
"A" has ten dollars.
You can give "B" any amount you

716
41:25
choose from that ten dollars,
from one dollar to ten dollars.

717
41:31
"B" can do only one thing.
"B" can accept it;

718
41:36
if you accept it,
you agree to take home the

719
41:39
money and "A" keeps what ever's
left--or reject it.

720
41:42
If you reject it,
you get nothing.

721
41:45
Nobody gets anything.
Is everybody clear?

722
41:48
So "A" is going to say,
"I'll give you so and so

723
41:50
dollars."
"B" would say,

724
41:51
"Okay," in which case "B" walks
away with so and so dollars

725
41:55
or--and "A" walks away with
whatever rest or "B" could say,

726
41:59
"Reject," in which case nobody
gets anything.

727
42:04
So, this game comes in two
steps.

728
42:05
The first thing:
I would like "A" to turn to "B"

729
42:08
and make your offer.

730
42:09


731
42:12
Don't--"B" doesn't do anything
yet.

732
42:14
Make your offer.

733
42:15


734
42:22
Your offer should be one word.
People are explaining their

735
42:25
offer.
Make your offer.

736
42:27
Okay.
Stage two.

737
42:31
Do not negotiate.
[laughter]

738
42:34
You're not--I see people waving
their hands and it's

739
42:37
complicated.
It should be a number from one

740
42:39
to ten, a positive integer.
Now, "B" --I would like "B" to

741
42:44
say one word and you can say it
really loud on three.

742
42:48
Accept or reject.
One, two, three.

743
42:53
[laughter] Wow.
How many people accepted?

744
42:59
Anybody reject it?
Good.

745
43:01
Okay.
How many people offered ten

746
43:07
dollars?
[laughter]

747
43:10
How many people offered more
than five dollars?

748
43:12
Okay.
How many people offered one

749
43:14
dollar?
Okay.

750
43:17
When you offered one dollar did
you accept?

751
43:21
Anybody else offer one dollar?
When you offered one dollar did

752
43:24
your partner accept?
Okay.

753
43:27
How many people offered either
four or five dollars?

754
43:31
Okay.
This is an interesting game

755
43:34
because the person who
offered--who accepted one dollar

756
43:39
was being rational.
One dollar is better than no

757
43:43
dollars.
So, the psychology of human

758
43:46
rationality is such that,
from a logical point of view,

759
43:50
you should reason one dollar is
better than nothing.

760
43:54
A rational person should accept
one dollar.

761
43:57
And because we're smart,
a--you should offer one dollar

762
44:00
but not many of you offered one
dollar.

763
44:03
Why?
Because you knew people are not

764
44:07
purely rational.
People, even in a one-shot

765
44:11
game, won't accept unfair
distributions.

766
44:14
They'll reject them just out of
spite.

767
44:16
And so, you need to offer more.
And this has been studied from

768
44:22
a neuro-economic point of view,
which basically provides

769
44:26
neuroanatomical evidence that
people--if you offered them one

770
44:30
dollar they get really pissed.
[laughter]

771
44:33
Nobody likes to be offered a
dollar.

772
44:35
Now, there's a more general
moral here, which is actually an

773
44:39
interesting surprise of some
relevance to everyday life.

774
44:42
A rational person is easily
exploited.

775
44:46
A rational person's responses
to provocations,

776
44:51
to assaults will always be
measured inappropriate.

777
44:56
If you know I'm rational and
you're in a sharing situation

778
45:00
with me, you could say to me,
"Hey.

779
45:02
Here's a dollar.
Hey, Mr.

780
45:03
Rational, a dollar's better
than nothing."

781
45:05
"Well, okay," because I'm
rational.

782
45:08
Similarly, you could mess with
me because you could harass me

783
45:12
in all sorts of ways,
take things that I own,

784
45:15
as long as you reason that a
rational person wouldn't start a

785
45:19
fuss about this.
There is some advantage to

786
45:23
being irrational,
to having a temper.

787
45:26
Because if you have a temper
and you're known to be

788
45:30
irrational, people are forced,
by dint of your irrationality,

789
45:33
to treat you better.
Who am I going to take from?

790
45:37
The person who's extremely
reasonable or the person who has

791
45:41
a hair-trigger temper?
Well, I'm going to pick on a

792
45:45
reasonable person because the
unreasonable person might do

793
45:49
unreasonable things.
And this is faintly

794
45:52
paradoxical, but often to be
irrational, or at least to have

795
45:57
a reputation for mild
irrationality,

796
45:59
gives you an edge.
Now, this isn't focus of

797
46:03
provocation but this has also
been presented in the theory of

798
46:06
why people fall in love.
Suppose you're choosing who to

799
46:10
devote your life to,
and it's a matter of huge

800
46:13
trust.
We're going to raise kids

801
46:15
together.
It's very important for you

802
46:17
that I don't leave.
And I am very rational so I say

803
46:20
to you, "We should mate and have
children because I find you the

804
46:24
most attractive of everybody who
was available that I've met so

805
46:28
far.
I'm very rational and so long

806
46:31
as this continues to be the case
we'll be together."

807
46:35
Well, that's reasonable and
rational but wouldn't you rather

808
46:39
be with somebody who's head over
heels in love?

809
46:42
Head over heels in love is
irrational but it's also,

810
46:46
within certain parameters,
endearing because the

811
46:49
irrationality of the person
means you could trust them more

812
46:53
in the long run,
just like the irrationality of

813
46:56
somebody who has a temper means
you don't mess with them as

814
47:00
much.
The studies have been done more

815
47:03
with regard to violence than
with love.

816
47:06
And in fact,
the irrationality--the benefits

817
47:11
of irrational violence have been
translated in terms of the study

818
47:17
of homicide and other crimes.
Daly and Wilson describe the

819
47:24
cause of murder.
Most murder is not caused by

820
47:29
reasonable provocation.
Most murder is not rational in

821
47:35
its response.
Most murder is generated by

822
47:38
insult, curse,
petty infraction,

823
47:41
but this is not crazy
irrationality.

824
47:44
It's adaptive irrationality.
Daly and Wilson point out,

825
47:47
"in chronically feuding and
warring societies an essential

826
47:51
manual--manly virtue is the
capacity for violence.

827
47:54
To turn the other cheek is not
saintly, but stupid or

828
47:57
contemptibly weak."
If I show myself a rational

829
48:00
person when picked on or
harassed, I'll be known as

830
48:04
somebody you could pick on and
harass.

831
48:07
And in fact,
it turns out even in the modern

832
48:10
world--This is from a New
York Times I just picked up

833
48:14
a year ago today.
And the point is that the

834
48:17
violence is due to people
disrespecting each other or

835
48:21
giving a dirty look.
And you might think "isn't that

836
48:24
irrational?"
But it's not irrational in

837
48:26
circumstances where people live
together in an environment where

838
48:29
they have to deal with each
other over and over again,

839
48:32
and often where there's not
much support by the police as

840
48:36
indications they talked about
here.

841
48:38
What's particularly interesting
is this sort of importance of a

842
48:44
reputation for violence differs
from culture to culture.

843
48:49
And I've been talking so far in
this class--and in fact,

844
48:53
so far in this course--about
universals,

845
48:57
about things that are built in,
things that show up across

846
48:59
humans and other animals.
I want to turn now and end this

847
49:03
lecture by talking a little bit
about a cultural difference.

848
49:08
And it's a psychologically
interesting cultural difference

849
49:11
with regard to the emotions.
And it's built around the

850
49:15
difference turning around what
sociologists call "cultures of

851
49:19
honor."
A culture of honor has certain

852
49:23
properties.
You can't rely on the law.

853
49:26
And it has resources that are
easily taken.

854
49:30
And sociologists have argued
that when those conditions are

855
49:34
met it becomes important to
develop a reputation for violent

856
49:38
retaliation.
That becomes important.

857
49:42
Examples of culture of honors
include Scottish highlanders,

858
49:45
Masai warriors,
Bedouin tradesmen,

859
49:48
and Western cowboys – all
cases where there's resources

860
49:51
such as cattle that are
vulnerable and easily taken,

861
49:55
but you can't count on calling
911 and having people come help

862
50:00
you.
But the culture of honor that's

863
50:02
been studied the most by modern
psychologists is the American

864
50:05
South.
This was settled by herdsmen

865
50:07
and traditionally has less
centralized legal control.

866
50:11
So, the sociologists say the
American South has more of a

867
50:14
culture of honor than the
American North.

868
50:17
But how do you know?
What does that do?

869
50:19
We're interested in this class
in claims about psychology.

870
50:24
So, it took Richard Nisbett and
Dov Cohen to study cultures of

871
50:29
honors and look at differences.
And they found some interesting

872
50:34
differences.
Gun laws tend to be more

873
50:36
permissive in the southern--in
the American South than the

874
50:40
American North.
Corporal punishment and capital

875
50:43
punishment tend to be more
approved of.

876
50:46
Attitudes towards the military
are more positive.

877
50:49
In questionnaire studies,
people are more forgiving

878
50:52
towards cultures of honor.
Somebody insults my woman and I

879
50:55
punch him in the face.
This is considered less bad in

880
50:59
the American South than the
American North.

881
51:02
There's a higher rate of
violence but only in certain

882
51:05
circumstances.
The streets of the American

883
51:08
South as a rule are not more
dangerous than the American

884
51:11
North.
The difference is there's a

885
51:13
higher rate of crimes that are
crimes of honor such as,

886
51:16
for instance,
if somebody breaks in to my

887
51:18
house, me shooting him.
Or if somebody insults me,

888
51:22
me killing him.
Now, this is sort of survey

889
51:25
studies.
So, Nisbett and Cohen did one

890
51:28
of the more interesting
psychological studies I have

891
51:31
ever heard of.
And they did this

892
51:34
at--This--Sorry.
This is Nisbett and Wilson.

893
51:37
They did this with University
of Michigan undergraduates.

894
51:40
They did a subject pool thing
like you're doing now,

895
51:44
and on it your demographic
information was listed.

896
51:48
And what they did was they took
white males who are not Hispanic

897
51:53
and not Jewish.
That was their sample.

898
51:56
Culture of honor is a phenomena
limited to males and they wanted

899
51:59
to make it sort of a clean study
so they wanted to focus--get a

900
52:03
homogenous sample.
So, not Hispanic, not Jewish.

901
52:06
And they provoked them.
And the provocation was genius.

902
52:11
What they did was they
said--they brought people in to

903
52:14
the psychology building,
as you'd be brought in to

904
52:16
Kirtland or SSS or Dunham and
they said--they had somebody go

905
52:19
in to the desk and they said,
"Yeah.

906
52:22
Go down the hall for the
experiment."

907
52:24
There was a hallway and then
you walked through the hallway.

908
52:27
And walking in the other
direction at that moment a

909
52:30
graduate student--a male
graduate student would start to

910
52:33
walk.
And he's holding some files.

911
52:35
And what he does is he bumps
the person, looks at him and

912
52:39
says, "Asshole" [laughter]
and keep walking.

913
52:43
Now, to be fair,
the graduate student survived

914
52:47
bumping into hundreds of males,
calling them assholes and then

915
52:52
walking to--Fights did not break
out, nobody was shot.

916
52:55
But then they brought the
men--now went in to a room and

917
52:59
they were tested.
And it turned out that there

918
53:03
were differences in the stress
response.

919
53:07
On average, males from the
American South showed higher

920
53:11
hormone response and stress
response than males in the

921
53:14
American North--increases in
testosterone and cortisol.

922
53:18
There's always differences in
later behavior,

923
53:22
the people--suggesting that
they were made angry.

924
53:27
They gave differences in
fill-in-the-blank questions,

925
53:30
for instance.
I don't remember the examples

926
53:33
but it's examples like "John
went to the store and bought a

927
53:38
'blank'" and then the
northerners would say "and buy

928
53:42
an apple."
And the southerners would say

929
53:45
"an AK-47 [laughter]
to kill that freaking graduate

930
53:48
student."
[laughter]

931
53:50
Now, again, the American
South--people in the American

932
53:53
South were not overall more
violent than the American North,

933
53:57
but they were more sensitive to
provocations of honor.

934
54:00
Now, when I gave this lecture a
few years ago,

935
54:03
a southern student contacted me
afterwards and said that she

936
54:07
felt that picking out the
southern minority at Yale was in

937
54:11
some regard offensive and that
people say things at Yale about

938
54:15
southerners--American
southerners that they would

939
54:18
never say about any other
minority group.

940
54:21
So, there's two points I want
to make regarding this.

941
54:23
One is, of course,
these are average differences.

942
54:26
Not every northerner and
southerner would differ along

943
54:29
these lines.
But another one is I think the

944
54:32
effect is real,
but it's not entirely clear

945
54:34
that it reflects poorly on the
cultures of honor as opposed to

946
54:38
the other cultures.
So, Nisbett,

947
54:40
for instance,
is himself a southerner and he

948
54:43
points out that he went to the
North he was most astonished by

949
54:47
how rude people are.
And this is because the

950
54:49
North--the American North is not
particularly a culture of honor,

951
54:53
and so there's less proper
behavior towards other people

952
54:57
because there's no fear of
retaliation or response.

953
55:00
Moreover, the culture of honor
virtues like honor,

954
55:05
loyalty, courage and
self-reliance,

955
55:08
are on the face of it not
necessarily bad things.

956
55:13
In any case,
this is an interesting example

957
55:17
of how there's an evolutionary
background but culture modifies

958
55:22
and shifts it in different ways.
More generally,

959
55:26
I've suggested over the last
couple of lectures that emotions

960
55:30
like fear,
the love you have towards your

961
55:32
children, anger,
gratitude are not aberrations

962
55:34
or noise in the system.
Rather, they're exquisitely

963
55:37
complicated motivational systems
that are crafted to deal with

964
55:40
the natural and social
environment.

965
55:42
And we know this only from an
analysis that starts from an

966
55:47
evolutionary approach.
So, to bring us back to D'Arcy

967
55:50
Thompson, "everything is the way
it is because it got that way."

968
55:54
And your reading response for
this week is that.

969
55:59
And I'll wish you good luck on
the exam on Wednesday.

970
56:04
And I'll see you there.
