Professor Paul Bloom:
What we've been talking about

2
0:16
so far in the course are human
universals, what everybody

3
0:19
shares.
So, we've been talking about

4
0:22
language, about rationality,
about perception,

5
0:25
about the emotions,
about universals of

6
0:28
development, and we've been
talking about what people share.

7
0:32
But honestly,
what a lot of us are very

8
0:35
interested in is why we're
different and the nature of

9
0:40
these differences and the
explanation for them.

10
0:44
And that's what we'll turn to
today.

11
0:45
So first, we'll discuss how are
people different,

12
0:49
different theories about what
makes you different in a

13
0:52
psychological way from the
person sitting next to you,

14
0:56
and then we'll review different
theories about why people are

15
1:00
different.
And this is the class which is

16
1:04
going to bother the most people.
It's not dualism.

17
1:09
It's not evolution.
It's this because the

18
1:12
scientific findings on human
psychological differences are,

19
1:16
to many of us,
shocking and unbelievable.

20
1:19
And I will just try to persuade
you to take them seriously.

21
1:24
Okay.
So, how are people different?

22
1:27
Well, there's all sorts of ways.
Your sexual identity--It is at

23
1:31
the core of your being for
almost all of us whether you're

24
1:37
male or female.
How we refer to you in

25
1:40
language, what pronoun we use,
is indexed on how we--on

26
1:44
your--on how--whether you're
male or female and related to

27
1:48
that though imperfectly is your
sexual orientation,

28
1:52
who you're attracted to.
The question of why some of us

29
1:55
think of ourselves as males and
others as females,

30
1:58
and the question of why some of
us would ideally want to have

31
2:01
sex with males,
others with females,

32
2:03
others with both,
and then a few others who have

33
2:07
harder to define desires,
is such a good question that

34
2:11
we're going to talk about it
after spring break while all the

35
2:15
sexual desire has been spent and
you could focus on [laughter]

36
2:19
on a scientific discussion of
this--not that I recommend you

37
2:23
do that on spring break.
How happy are you?

38
2:27
This is also such a good topic
it's going to get its own class.

39
2:31
The very last class of the
semester is devoted to happiness

40
2:35
and the question of what makes
people happy,

41
2:39
what makes people unhappy,
and what makes people differ in

42
2:42
their happiness.
If I asked you to rank how

43
2:45
happy you are from a scale of 1
to 10, the numbers would differ

44
2:49
across this room.
And there's different theories

45
2:52
as to why.
Your success and failure in

46
2:54
life--This is somewhat
interesting because you could

47
2:57
study this in more or less
objective ways.

48
3:00
We don't have to ask people.
We could look at your

49
3:03
relationships,
how they begin,

50
3:04
how they end,
your job satisfaction.

51
3:07
We could look at your criminal
records.

52
3:09
Some of you are going to see
time.

53
3:11
Most will not.
Some of you will get into

54
3:15
little troubles all through your
life.

55
3:17
Some of you already have seen
the inside of a police station,

56
3:21
possibly a lineup.
Others couldn't go near such a

57
3:25
thing.
What determines that?

58
3:28
And at the root of all human
differences are two main

59
3:35
factors.
And so, I want to talk about

60
3:37
the two main interesting
factors.

61
3:39
One is personality.
The other is intelligence.

62
3:43
And this is what--These are the
differences I'll talk about

63
3:46
today first from the standpoint
of how do we characterize them,

64
3:50
how do we explain them,
and then from the standpoint of

65
3:53
why these differences exist in
the first place.

66
3:56


67
4:00
One way to characterize
personality is in terms of

68
4:04
people's style with dealing
with--in dealing with the world

69
4:08
and particularly their style
with dealing--in dealing with

70
4:13
other people.
So, you take a simple character

71
4:16
you know of and you could talk
about that person's personality.

72
4:20
You could talk about it in
terms of being impulsive,

73
4:23
irresponsible,
sometimes lazy,

74
4:25
good-hearted.
You could compare that person's

75
4:28
personality with other people's
personalities such as my

76
4:32
colleague who gave a talk last
class.

77
4:35
He's wonderful.
He's responsible and reliable

78
4:38
and very kind [laughter]
and different from Homer.

79
4:42
And so, this difference is a
difference in personality.

80
4:45
Now, when we talk about
personality we're talking about

81
4:48
something else as well.
We're talking about a stable

82
4:52
trait across situations and
time.

83
4:54
So, if all of a sudden the
person next to you kind of

84
4:57
smacks you in the head,
you might be angry but we

85
5:00
wouldn't call that "personality"
because that's something that's

86
5:04
a result of a situation.
We'd all feel that way in that

87
5:07
situation.
It's "personality" if you walk

88
5:10
around all the time angry.
That'd be a stable trait.

89
5:14
That'd be something you carry
around with you and that's what

90
5:17
we mean by personality.
Now, how do we scientifically

91
5:21
characterize differences in
personality?

92
5:24
And it's a deep question.
There's been a lot of attempts

93
5:27
to do so.
Any assessment has--Any good

94
5:30
assessment has to satisfy two
conditions.

95
5:34
And these are terms which are
going to show up all over

96
5:37
psychological research but it's
particularly relevant for this

97
5:41
sort of measure.
One is "reliability."

98
5:45
Reliability means there is not
measurement error.

99
5:51
And one crude way to think
about reliability is,

100
5:55
a test is reliable if you test
the same person at different

101
5:59
times and you get the same
result.

102
6:02
My bathroom scale is reliable
if whenever I stand on it,

103
6:06
it gives me more or less the
same number.

104
6:08
It's not reliable if it's off
by ten pounds in the course of a

105
6:13
day.
Similarly, if I give you a

106
6:16
personality test now and it says
that you're anxious and

107
6:19
defensive,
well--and then give it to you

108
6:22
tomorrow and it says you're calm
and open minded,

109
6:25
it's not a reliable test.
So, reliable is something you

110
6:29
could trust over time.
"Validity" is something

111
6:32
different.
Validity is that your test

112
6:35
measures what it's supposed to
measure.

113
6:39
So, validity means it's sort of
a good test.

114
6:42
Forget about how reliable it is.
Does it tap what you're

115
6:45
interested in?
So, for example,

116
6:47
suppose I determine your
intelligence by the date of your

117
6:50
birth.
I figure out what day you were

118
6:53
born and I have a theory that,
from that, predicts how smart

119
6:57
you are.
That's my intelligence test,

120
6:59
the date of your birth.
Maybe people born in January

121
7:02
are the dumbest,
people born in December are the

122
7:04
smartest.
Is that--I was born on

123
7:08
Christmas Eve.
[laughter]

124
7:11
Is that a reliable test?
Yes, it's a wonderfully

125
7:14
reliable test.
I'll test you today;

126
7:16
I'll test you tomorrow;
I'll test you next year;

127
7:18
I'll test you the day you die;
I'll get the same IQ score.

128
7:21
Is it a valid test?
It's a joke.

129
7:24
It's absolutely not a valid
test.

130
7:26
It has nothing to do with
intelligence.

131
7:27
But you noticed these are two
different things.

132
7:30
Something can be reliable but
not valid and something can be

133
7:35
valid and not reliable.
Now, there are no shortage of

134
7:39
personality tests.
You could get them all over the

135
7:44
place including on the web.
So, I took one recently.

136
7:49
I took "which super hero are
you?"

137
7:54
[laughter]
And it's a series of questions

138
7:56
determining what super hero you
are.

139
7:58
You could take this yourself if
you want to.

140
8:00
The same web page,
by the way, offers you a test

141
8:03
in whether you're "hot" or not.
We'll discuss that later.

142
8:07
And when I did this [laughter]
it told me I was Batman

143
8:11
[laughter]
and "you are dark,

144
8:14
love gadgets,
and have vowed to help the

145
8:16
innocent not suffer the pain you
have endured."

146
8:18
Now, the honest-- [laughter]
Now, to be honest though,

147
8:22
it's neither reliable nor
valid.

148
8:24
When I first did the test I
came up as "The Incredible

149
8:27
Hulk."
I then changed my answers a bit

150
8:30
and was "Wonder Woman."
[laughter]

151
8:32
And finally,
out of frustration,

152
8:34
I carefully tailored my answers
so I would be Batman.

153
8:38
But the fact that I can do
that, well, raises questions

154
8:42
about both the reliability of
this measure and its validity.

155
8:47
Here is an example – a real
world example.

156
8:49
This is, in black and white
form, a version of the Rorschach

157
8:54
test, the Rorschach inkblot
test.

158
8:57
How many people have heard of
the Rorschach test?

159
9:00
Okay.
Is there anybody here who has

160
9:03
actually, in any sort of
situation, taken a Rorschach

161
9:06
test?
Some people scattered in the

162
9:09
room have taken them.
It was originally used only for

163
9:12
psychiatric cases but then
became extremely common.

164
9:16
About eighty percent of
clinical psychologists claim to

165
9:20
use it and most graduate
programs in the American

166
9:24
Psychological Association who
are accredited teach it.

167
9:29
Catholic seminaries use it for
people who want to join the

168
9:34
seminary.
It was invented by a guy named

169
9:37
Herman Rorschach.
He devoted his entire life to

170
9:42
the inkblot test.
His nickname when he was a

171
9:45
teenager – I am not kidding
you – was "Inkblot."

172
9:49
[laughter]
And the idea is by looking at

173
9:52
these inkblots and then seeing
what somebody says you get great

174
9:56
insights into the nature of
their personality,

175
9:59
into what they are.
Anybody want to try it?

176
10:03


177
10:07
Come on.
Yes.

178
10:09
What do you see?
Student:

179
10:11
I see two people holding hands
pressed together.

180
10:13
Professor Paul Bloom:
Two people holding hands pressed

181
10:15
together.
Very good.

182
10:16
Anybody have a different
reading?

183
10:18
Yes, in back.
Yes.

184
10:21
Yes.
Student: Dancing bears.

185
10:22
Professor Paul Bloom:
Dancing bears.

186
10:24
Okay.
Good.[laughter] Good.

187
10:28
Okay.
I got to write your name down--

188
10:31
[laughs][laughter]
report you to health-- No.

189
10:33
Dancing bears, very good.
Anybody else?

190
10:36
One other.
Yes.

191
10:38
Student:
A man in a ski mask.

192
10:39
Professor Paul Bloom: A
man in a ski mask.

193
10:41
Well, it turns out that there
are right answers and wrong

194
10:46
answers to the Rorschach test.
According to the test,

195
10:51
and this is from a real
Rorschach test,

196
10:54
"it is important to see the
blot as two human figures,

197
10:57
usually females or clowns."
Good work over there.

198
11:01
"If you don't,
it's seen as a sign you have

199
11:03
problems relating to people."
[laughter]

200
11:06
If you want to go for "a cave
entrance" or "butterfly" or

201
11:10
"vagina," that's also okay.
[laughter]

202
11:13
Now, the Rorschach test is
transcendently useless.

203
11:20
It has been studied and
explored and it is as useless as

204
11:26
throwing dice.
It is as useless as tea leaves.

205
11:30
Nonetheless,
people love it and it's used

206
11:33
all over the place.
It is used for example in child

207
11:37
custody cases.
If you have broken up with your

208
11:40
partner and you guys are
quarreling over who gets to keep

209
11:43
the kids,
you might find yourself in a

210
11:46
shrink's office looking at this.
And in fact,

211
11:49
this is why they end up on the
web.

212
11:51
There are services.
There are people who have been

213
11:54
kind enough to put on the web
these inkblots,

214
11:57
including the right answers to
them.

215
11:59
But they are worthless as
psychological measures.

216
12:02
Can we do better?
Well, we probably can.

217
12:06
Gordon Allport did a study
where he went through the

218
12:10
dictionary and took all of the
traits that he believed to be

219
12:14
related to personality and he
got eighteen thousand of them.

220
12:19
But what was interesting was
they weren't necessarily

221
12:23
independent traits.
So, the traits like "friendly,

222
12:28
sociable, welcoming,
warm-hearted" seemed to all tap

223
12:32
the same thing.
So, Cattell and many others

224
12:36
tried to narrow it down,
tried to ask the question,

225
12:40
"In how many ways are people's
personalities different from one

226
12:44
another?"
How many parameters of

227
12:46
difference do you need?
How many numbers can I give you

228
12:51
that would narrow you in and say
what personality you are?

229
12:56
One approach was from Eysenck,
who claimed there were just

230
13:01
two.
You could be somewhere on the

231
13:04
scale of
introverted-extroverted,

232
13:06
and somewhere on the scale of
neurotic and stable.

233
13:10
And since there's basically two
types of traits with two

234
13:13
settings for each,
there are basically four types

235
13:16
of people.
Later on he added another trait

236
13:18
which he described as
"psychoticism versus

237
13:21
non-psychoticism" that crudely
meant whether you're aggressive

238
13:25
or empathetic.
And then you have three traits

239
13:29
with two settings each giving
you eight types of people.

240
13:35
Later on Cattell dropped it
down into sixteen factors.

241
13:39
So, these sixteen personality
factors are sixteen ways people

242
13:43
would differ.
And so, if I asked you to

243
13:46
describe your roommate along
these sixteen dimensions,

244
13:50
you should be able to do so.
More recently,

245
13:54
people have come to the
conclusion that two or three is

246
13:58
too few, but sixteen might be
too many.

247
14:02
And there's a psychological
consensus on what's been known

248
14:08
as "The Big Five."
And "The Big Five" personality

249
14:13
factors are these,
and what this means is when we

250
14:18
talk about each other and use
adjectives,

251
14:22
the claim is we could do so in
thousands of different ways,

252
14:25
but deep down we're talking
about one of these five

253
14:28
dimensions.
This means that when a

254
14:31
psychological test measures
something about somebody,

255
14:34
about their personality,
if it's a good test it's

256
14:37
measuring one of these five
things.

257
14:39
And it means that,
as people interacting with one

258
14:42
another in the world,
these are the five things that

259
14:45
we're interested in.
So, one of them is "neurotic

260
14:50
versus stable."
Is somebody sort of nutty and

261
14:56
worrying or are they calm?
"Extrovert versus introvert."

262
15:01
"Open to experience versus
closed to experience."

263
15:06
"Agreeable," which is
courteous, friendly versus non

264
15:10
agreeable, rude,
selfish.

265
15:12
And "conscientious versus not
conscientious," careful versus

266
15:17
careless, reliable versus
undependable.

267
15:21
A good way to think about these
things is in terms of the word

268
15:27
"ocean," o-c-e-a-n.
The first letter captures

269
15:31
openness, conscientiousness,
extroversion,

270
15:34
agreeableness,
and neuroticism.

271
15:37
And the claim is those are the
four--the five fundamental ways

272
15:41
in which people differ from one
another.

273
15:44
Well, why should we believe
this?

274
15:46
Why should we take this theory
seriously?

275
15:49
Well, there's actually some
evidence for it.

276
15:51
It seems to have some
reliability in that it's stable

277
16:01
over time.
So, if you test people over

278
16:05
years--If I test your
personality now on the five

279
16:08
traits and test you five years
from now, it will not have

280
16:11
changed much.
And once you pass the age of

281
16:15
thirty, it's very stable indeed.
If you think about your parents

282
16:19
and then give Mom and Dad a
mental test on where they stand

283
16:24
on each of the five traits,
ten years from now Mom and Dad

284
16:27
will still be there.
It also seems to get agreement

285
16:31
across multiple observers.
So, if I ask for each of their

286
16:36
five traits--If I ask your
roommate what he or she thinks

287
16:42
of you,
then I ask your professor what

288
16:45
he or she thinks of you and your
mom what he or--what she thinks

289
16:49
of you,
[laughter]

290
16:50
how would--back to gender--How
would they match up?

291
16:55
They tend to overlap a lot.
You walk around and you

292
16:59
leave--and your personality
leaves a trail in the minds of

293
17:02
people around you.
And this trail is characterized

294
17:05
in terms of these five
dimensions.

295
17:07
Finally, it seems to
be--predict real-world behavior.

296
17:13
If this didn't have anything to
do with the real world,

297
17:16
you wouldn't be very happy
calling it valid,

298
17:19
you wouldn't take it seriously
as a test, but it does.

299
17:21
So, conscientiousness--how you
score on a conscientious scale,

300
17:25
relates to how faithful you are
to your spouse.

301
17:28
How openness--open you are on a
psychological personality test

302
17:33
relates to how likely you are to
change your job.

303
17:37
"Extroverts" look people in the
eye more and have more sexual

304
17:41
partners because they're
extroverts.

305
17:43
So, these are real scales.
The "Batman,

306
17:46
Hulk, Wonder Woman" doesn't
correspond to anything in the

307
17:50
real world,
but where you stand on each of

308
17:52
these five dimensions does seem
to capture it.

309
17:55
As an example of the agreement,
by the way, somebody did a

310
17:59
study of several of the
characters on the television

311
18:03
show "The Simpsons" because they
wanted to find characters which

312
18:08
everybody knew.
And they had thirteen subjects

313
18:12
judge these Simpson characters
on each of the five dimensions.

314
18:17
These is "openness,
neuroticism,

315
18:20
conscientiousness,
and extroversion" and they

316
18:24
found considerable agreement.
And this isn't actually--What

317
18:29
I've covered up is the
"agreeableness."

318
18:32
So, for those of you who have
never seen the television show,

319
18:35
this is all going to be
confusing,

320
18:38
but those of you who have,
can you guess which characters

321
18:42
would be particularly agreeable?
Anybody guess.

322
18:46
Yeah.
Student: Flanders

323
18:48
Professor Paul Bloom:
Flanders.

324
18:49
You are right.
The most agreeable people are

325
18:53
Flanders and Marge.
Who would not so agreeable?

326
18:58
Student:
Krusty Professor Paul

327
19:02
Bloom: Krusty is
actually--Krusty is a

328
19:05
complicated case [laughter]
but Mr.

329
19:09
Burns--but also--Where is he?
Oh, he's not--Nelson,

330
19:14
where's Nelson?
Anyway, there's Nelson.

331
19:18
You get strong consensus that
Ned Flanders and Marge Simpson

332
19:23
are highly agreeable people,
6.27 and 5.46,

333
19:27
while Mr.
Burns and Nelson are very low.

334
19:31
Nelson's the little kid that
when trouble happens he goes,

335
19:34
"Ha ha."
And that's a psychological sign

336
19:37
for low agreeability.
[laughter] Okay.

337
19:39
That's all I want to say at
this point about personality and

338
19:42
how we measure it and,
again, we're going to get back

339
19:45
to it later when we talk about
differences in personality.

340
19:48
Now, I want to deal with the
second big difference.

341
19:51
The second big difference is
intelligence.

342
19:53
Now, how do you define
intelligence?

343
19:57
There's no easy definition.
Like personality,

344
19:59
it's kind of difficult to get
your fingers on what we're

345
20:02
talking about here.
In one survey they asked 1,000

346
20:05
experts to define intelligence.
And some answers showed up over

347
20:09
and over again.
So, just about everybody said

348
20:12
intelligence involves abstract
reasoning, problem solving,

349
20:15
and the capacity to acquire
knowledge.

350
20:18
That's at the core of being
smart.

351
20:21
Other people mentioned things
like memory, mental speed,

352
20:25
language, math,
mental speed again,

353
20:27
knowledge, and creativity also
as hallmarks for intelligence.

354
20:33
And again, it might be
difficult to define it but you

355
20:37
have a gut feeling about what it
is.

356
20:39
So, you know Homer is
actually--and this is part of

357
20:42
the show--is actually of limited
intelligence.

358
20:45
My colleague is of very high
intelligence,

359
20:48
a wonderful fellow,
[laughter]

360
20:51
but he's probably not as smart
as that guy who is really,

361
20:55
really smart.
And this guy,

362
20:58
Ralph Wiggum,
is particularly stupid.

363
21:02
[laughter]
And so you have a range.

364
21:03
And it's important to figure
out how to characterize it;

365
21:06
this is what research does,
but there's a gut feeling that

366
21:09
there are some people who are
smart and other people who are

367
21:12
very smart and some people who
are dumb and others who are very

368
21:15
dumb.
What you want to do,

369
21:17
from a scientific standpoint,
is characterize this in a more

370
21:21
robust and interesting fashion.
And the textbook has a nice

371
21:25
review of the history of
attempts to define and measure

372
21:29
intelligence,
but there is a couple of ideas

373
21:31
I want to focus on.
One is an idea developed by

374
21:35
Spearman, which is there's two
types of intelligence.

375
21:40
There is "G" and there is "S."
"S" is your ability on specific

376
21:47
tests.
So, if there is ten tests that

377
21:50
you're given as part of an IQ
test, ten subtests,

378
21:54
you'll get a different score on
each of the subtests.

379
21:59
There'll be a math test and a
reading test and a spatial test

380
22:02
and you'll get different scores.
"G" refers to a general

381
22:07
intelligence.
And the general intelligence is

382
22:12
something you bring to each of
the tests in common.

383
22:16
So, this is diagrammed here.
You have these six tests.

384
22:20
For each of them there is an
"S" and then above that there is

385
22:24
a "G."
Now, "G" is a very important

386
22:27
notion.
The term "G" is used by

387
22:29
psychologists a lot even in
casual conversation.

388
22:32
People say, "So,
what do you think of him?"

389
22:34
"I think he is high 'G.'"
And what you mean is he's a

390
22:38
smart guy.
Why do you need "G?"

391
22:41
Well, you wouldn't need "G" if
your performance on each of

392
22:44
these tests had nothing to do
with each other.

393
22:46
If the tests were genuinely
separate, there'd be no general

394
22:51
intelligence.
But what people find over and

395
22:54
over again is that when it comes
to explaining people's

396
22:57
performance on multiple
intellectual tasks,

397
22:59
there's two things going on.
There's how good there is--they

398
23:03
are on the specific task,
but then there's also a sort of

399
23:07
general correlation that people
bring to the tasks.

400
23:10
And I could express this with
an athletic analogy.

401
23:13
Imagine I'm running a gym and
we have all of these different

402
23:18
athletic tests.
So, we have a running test,

403
23:21
we have a basketball shooting
test, a swimming test,

404
23:25
fencing, a list of ten of them.
Now, each of you go through

405
23:30
each of the tests and then
you'll each get ten scores.

406
23:33
But what we'll discover is that
the scores are not independent

407
23:38
of one another.
People who are good at one

408
23:42
athletic thing tend to be good
at another.

409
23:44
If there's somebody who's
really good at running and

410
23:47
swimming, odds are they're
probably pretty good at

411
23:50
climbing.
And the same thing holds for

412
23:53
IQ, which is above and beyond
how good people are at specific

413
23:57
things there seems to be a
factor as to how well they are

414
24:00
in general.
And this factor is known as "G."

415
24:04
Now, there's,
again, an extensive history of

416
24:08
modern intelligence tests and
what's really interesting is the

417
24:14
tests now.
What you need to know about the

418
24:17
modern tests,
the Wechsler test for both

419
24:19
adults and children,
is how they're scored.

420
24:21


421
24:24
The way they are scored is that
100 is average.

422
24:29
So, it's just automatic.
Whatever the average is is 100.

423
24:35
It's as if I did the
Midterm--graded the Midterm,

424
24:37
computed the average,
gave everybody who got the

425
24:39
average 100, said your score is
100.

426
24:41
It's just the average.
It works on the normal curve

427
24:46
and what this means is that it
works so that the majority,

428
24:53
68%, get between 85 and 115 on
their IQ test.

429
24:59
The vast majority,
95%, get between 70 and 130.

430
25:07
If you are, say,
above 145 IQ,

431
25:10
which I imagine some people in
the room are,

432
25:15
you belong to 0.13% of the
population.

433
25:20
That's the way IQ tests work.
Now, this is about IQ tests.

434
25:25
We could now ask about their
reliability and their validity.

435
25:29
What do they mean?
Well, this has turned out to be

436
25:32
a matter of extreme debate.
This just reiterates what I

437
25:36
just said.
A lot of the debate was spawned

438
25:39
by the book by Herrnstein and
Murray about--called The Bell

439
25:44
Curve. And in The Bell
Curve these authors made the

440
25:48
argument that IQ matters
immensely for everyday life and

441
25:52
that people's status in society
– how rich they are and how

442
25:57
successful they are – follows
from their IQ as measured in

443
26:01
standard IQ tests.
Now, this book made a lot of

444
26:05
claims and it's probably before
many of you--many of your time,

445
26:10
but spawned huge controversy.
And as a result of this

446
26:14
controversy some interesting
papers came out.

447
26:17
One response to the Herrnstein
and Murray book was by the

448
26:21
American Psychological
Association,

449
26:23
which put together a group of
fifty leading researchers in

450
26:27
intelligence to write a report
on what they thought about

451
26:30
intelligence--what they thought
about,

452
26:32
"Does IQ matter?
How does IQ relate to

453
26:35
intelligence?
How does--what's the

454
26:37
different--why are people
different in intelligence?

455
26:40
Why do different human groups
differ in intelligence?"

456
26:42
and so on.
At the same time,

457
26:44
there was also another group of
IQ researchers,

458
26:48
not quite the same as the first
group, got together and wrote

459
26:52
another report.
And if you're interested in

460
26:55
this, the links to the reports
are on the Power Point slide.

461
26:58
Well, what did they conclude?
The conclusions were slightly

462
27:03
different but here's the broad
consensus by the experts

463
27:08
regarding the importance of IQ
tests.

464
27:12
And the claim is IQ is strongly
related more so--probably more

465
27:16
so than any other single
measurable human trait to many

466
27:19
important educational,
occupational,

467
27:22
economic, and social outcomes.
In some cases,

468
27:25
the correlation is very strong
such as success in school and

469
27:29
success in military training.
In other cases,

470
27:33
it's moderate but robust such
as "social competence."

471
27:37
And in other cases it's smaller
but consistent,

472
27:40
"law abidingness," and they
conclude whatever IQ test

473
27:44
measure it is of great practical
and social importance.

474
27:48
So, IQ matters.
More particularly,

475
27:50
IQ matters for "social
achievement," for "prestigious

476
27:53
positions,"
and for "on the job

477
27:55
performance" and other
work-related variables.

478
27:58
If I know your IQ score,
I know something about you that

479
28:02
matters.
It's not irrelevant just as if

480
28:04
I know your score on a
personality test of The Big Five

481
28:08
I would know something about you
that actually would tell me

482
28:11
something interesting about you
in the real world.

483
28:14
On the other hand,
there's a lot of controversy

484
28:18
about why this connection
exists.

485
28:21
So, to some extent,
people have worried that the

486
28:25
effectiveness of IQ is a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

487
28:29
And here is why.
If society takes IQ tests

488
28:35
important--seriously,
they become important.

489
28:39
So, it's true that your IQ is
very related to your success in

490
28:44
getting into a good school like
Yale.

491
28:47
But the reason for this,
in large extent,

492
28:50
is because to get to Yale they
give you an IQ test,

493
28:54
the SAT.
So, the same for graduate

494
28:57
school.
There is the GRE,

495
28:59
which is yet another IQ test.
So, to some extent,

496
29:02
it's a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

497
29:04
I could make--Society could
choose to make how tall you are

498
29:08
extremely important for
educational success.

499
29:11
They could say nobody under six
feet tall gets into Yale.

500
29:14
And then some psych professor
would stand up and say,

501
29:17
"Of course, height is
profoundly related to

502
29:19
educational accomplishment,"
and it would be because people

503
29:23
made it so.
So, to some extent,

504
29:25
the society that draws highly
on IQ tests regarding promotion

505
29:30
and educational achievement and
military status and so on--it's

506
29:36
just going to follow that IQ
then becomes important.

507
29:41
At the same time,
however, the role of IQ is

508
29:44
pretty clearly not entirely a
social construction.

509
29:48
There is some evidence that
your IQ score relates to

510
29:53
intelligence in an interesting
sense including domains like

511
29:58
mental speed and memory span.
So, your score on an IQ test,

512
30:04
for instance,
is to some extent related to

513
30:08
how fast you could think and
your memory abilities.

514
30:12
Now, I want to shift to the
second half of the class and

515
30:16
talk about why.
So, we talked about two

516
30:19
differences, one in
"personality",

517
30:21
one "intelligence."
I want to talk about why people

518
30:25
differ but before I do,
do people have any questions?

519
30:29
Yes.
Student:

520
30:33
About personality--This morning
I took a test--The way the test

521
30:45
was,
they asked you 100 questions

522
30:52
and [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

523
31:01
It's a good question.
The question is this young man

524
31:08
took--just took a personality
test.

525
31:11
He was accepted into Slytherin,
which is a Hogwarts reference.

526
31:15
I'm hip to that [laughter]
and--but the question is a good

527
31:20
one.
You're a clever man,

528
31:23
high "G," and you wanted to be
in Slytherin.

529
31:29
How do we know you didn't work
the test?

530
31:31
You're going to get these
personality tests all the time

531
31:34
and the personality
tests--You're applying for a

532
31:37
business and one of the tests
says "I like to steal from my

533
31:40
bosses."
Well, I don't think so.

534
31:42
No.
That's a little IQ test right

535
31:44
there.
So, the question is how do you

536
31:47
avoid that problem?
The test constructors have done

537
31:50
so in certain clever ways.
For instance,

538
31:54
there are often catch questions
designed to catch a liar.

539
31:58
Some of these questions pose
very unrealistic phenomena so

540
32:03
you might have a question in
there saying "I have never done

541
32:08
anything I am ashamed of."
Now, some people will say,

542
32:12
"Yes, that's true of me," but
they tend to be liars.

543
32:15
And so, unrealistic questions
tend to catch liars.

544
32:19
Also, you get the same question
asked in different ways across

545
32:23
the one hundred items and they
could use the correlations to

546
32:26
figure these things out.
Again, the proof is sort of in

547
32:29
the pudding.
The reliability and validity of

548
32:32
a test is determined,
in part, by just how well it

549
32:36
does at predicting your future
performance on the test and your

550
32:40
real world performance.
And a test that is easily

551
32:44
fooled--easily tricked by smart
people wouldn't survive long as

552
32:50
a personality test.
So, we know the test you got is

553
32:53
a pretty good test because it
seems to work for most people.

554
32:57
Yes.
Student:

555
33:01
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

556
33:04
It's a good question.
The question was about

557
33:07
"Emotional IQ," which is
something I'm actually going to

558
33:09
touch upon a little bit later in
the course,

559
33:11
but people have talked about
different forms of intelligence.

560
33:14
And emotional intelligence,
social intelligence,

561
33:18
is arguably a candidate for
success across different

562
33:23
domains.
The evidence for its predictive

563
33:26
power is not as strong as for
regular IQ tests so you might be

564
33:32
right.
It might turn out to be a much

565
33:34
better predictor but one,
it's not clear that we know

566
33:37
that yet.
Peter Salovey has actually done

567
33:39
some very interesting research
on this and is continuing work

568
33:42
along those lines.
The second thing is emotional

569
33:44
intelligence is actually related
to good, old-fashioned

570
33:47
intelligence.
They kind of pull together a

571
33:49
lot.
So, it's not entirely separate

572
33:51
but that's a good point and I'd
like to return to it a little

573
33:54
bit later on in the course.
Yes.

574
33:56
Student:
[inaudible]

575
34:01
Professor Paul Bloom:
Good question.

576
34:10
How do you determine when--what
a good test is?

577
34:12
And again, it's a real art
going through the details of how

578
34:16
to do that but the broad answers
involve reliability and

579
34:19
validity.
It's a good test if I test you

580
34:22
today and I test you tomorrow
and I get the same score.

581
34:25
It's a really good test if your
score on that test predicts your

582
34:30
grades or, if it's a personality
test,

583
34:33
predicts how many girlfriends
you have or predicts whether

584
34:37
people think you're a nice guy.
So, you have to see both the

585
34:41
replicability of the test over
time but also its relationship

586
34:45
to real world phenomena.
And that's important, again.

587
34:48
Why do we know the Batman,
Wonder Woman,

588
34:51
Hulk test is a bad one?
Well, one answer is because

589
34:55
what I--how I score on that test
isn't going to tell you anything

590
35:00
about me.
It's not going to relate to my

591
35:02
grades.
It's not going to relate to how

592
35:04
well I'm liked.
How do we know the SAT is

593
35:06
useful?
Well, it actually corresponds

594
35:10
with other things like grades.
Yes, in back.

595
35:15
Student:
[inaudible]

596
35:20
Professor Paul Bloom:
Absolutely.

597
35:29
The question is--When I'm
talking about personality I'm

598
35:32
defining it in terms of
something which is stable over

599
35:35
time.
And your question,

600
35:36
which is a good one,
is, "How do we know it's stable

601
35:38
over time?"
Can't it change?

602
35:40
And the answer is "yeah."
A lot of personality does

603
35:43
change over time.
A personality test you give to

604
35:46
a ten-year-old will relate but
not so strongly with that

605
35:50
individual when he's fifty.
On the other hand,

606
35:53
we know that the psychological
claim that there exists such a

607
35:57
thing as personality and it is
stable over time.

608
36:00
It's supported by the fact that
if you're an extrovert now

609
36:03
you'll likely be an extrovert
twenty years from now.

610
36:06
Not perfectly, so you're right.
You could change.

611
36:09
You could become an introvert,
you could become more of an

612
36:12
extrovert, but wherever you
stand now is significantly

613
36:15
related to where you'll be in
the future.

614
36:18
And that justifies talking
about it as a stable trait.

615
36:21
Same with IQ.
Your IQ might change.

616
36:24
It might go up,
it might go down,

617
36:26
but it won't go up and go down
that much and this is why it

618
36:29
makes sense to talk about
intelligence as a more or less

619
36:31
stable trait.
Okay.

620
36:33
Why are we different?
Well, you're different because

621
36:41
of two things:
Your genes and your

622
36:44
environment, your nature and
your nurture,

623
36:48
your heredity and your
experience.

624
36:52
And this doesn't say anything.
This is just defining the

625
36:55
question.
But the question of the role of

626
36:58
genes and the role of
environment in explaining human

627
37:02
differences is an interesting
one and it could be explored in

628
37:07
different ways.
But before talking about it I

629
37:10
have to clear up a common
misconception.

630
37:12
I'm going to talk about the
effects of genes and I'm going

631
37:16
to talk about heredity but I
want to be clear.

632
37:19
I am talking about the role of
genes and also the role of

633
37:23
environment in explaining human
differences, not in explaining

634
37:29
human characteristics.
So, the distinction is we're

635
37:33
interested in the amount of
variation due to genetic

636
37:36
differences,
not the proportion of an

637
37:38
individual's trait that's due to
genes.

638
37:41
So for instance,
you could pull these apart.

639
37:44
The question of--When we ask
what's the role of genes,

640
37:49
what's the role of heredity in
how tall people are,

641
37:53
the question is not asking for
you--what is the role of your

642
37:58
genes in determining how tall
you are?

643
38:01
It's not clear that's even a
sensible question.

644
38:03
The question is there's a
height difference between you

645
38:06
and me and him and her.
How do we explain that

646
38:08
difference?
And I could illustrate why

647
38:11
heredity doesn't mean the same
thing as the contribution of the

648
38:14
genes.
Height is reasonably heritable,

649
38:18
meaning the differences between
people in the population and how

650
38:24
tall they are is due in large
part,

651
38:27
not entirely,
but in large part to their

652
38:30
genes.
What about the number of legs

653
38:32
people have?
Well, the number of legs people

654
38:35
have from zero,
one or two, is actually not

655
38:39
very heritable at all because
almost everybody has two legs

656
38:43
and people who have fewer than
two legs typically have lost one

657
38:47
or both legs in an accident.
It's not due to their genes.

658
38:52
So, of course,
whether or not you have legs is

659
38:55
a very genetic matter but the
differences in number of legs is

660
39:01
not usually genetic.
And so, heredity is a claim

661
39:05
about differences,
not a claim about the origin of

662
39:08
any specific trait.
Well, now we--That's what

663
39:11
heredity, which is genetic--Now,
we could talk about

664
39:15
environment.
And we could break up

665
39:17
environment into two sorts of
environment.

666
39:19
One is shared environment.
And shared environment is the

667
39:23
extent to which the differences
are caused by things--by

668
39:27
phenomena that people raised in
the same household share.

669
39:31
So if one--Suppose some of you
are neurotic.

670
39:36
And suppose we want to say part
of that's due to your

671
39:40
environment.
Well, suppose you're neurotic

672
39:43
because you have lousy parents.
That would be part of your

673
39:47
shared environment because
presumably siblings raised in

674
39:52
the same household would have
the same lousy parents.

675
39:56
This is contrasted with
non-shared environment,

676
39:59
which is everything else.
Suppose I think you're neurotic

677
40:03
because when you were five years
old somebody threw a snowball at

678
40:06
you and it bounced off your
head.

679
40:08
That's non-shared environment.
Suppose you're neurotic because

680
40:12
you won the lottery when you
were twenty-one and all the

681
40:15
money messed you up.
That'd be non-shared

682
40:17
environment.
So, what you have here is

683
40:20
heredity, shared environment and
non-shared environment,

684
40:24
and this equals one.
That's everything.

685
40:27
Non-shared environment is a
sort of garbage can category

686
40:30
that includes everything that's
not heredity and not shared

687
40:34
environment.
Suppose you think you're

688
40:37
neurotic because aliens from the
planet Pluto are zapping your

689
40:41
brain.
Suppose you're right.

690
40:44
Well, that would be non-shared
environment because they're,

691
40:47
presumably, not necessarily
zapping your siblings' brains.

692
40:50
Everything else is non-shared
environment.

693
40:53
It becomes interesting to ask,
for all of these differences,

694
40:58
the physical differences like
height,

695
41:01
but psychological differences
like personality and

696
41:05
intelligence,
how do we parcel it out into

697
41:09
what's genetic and what's
environmental?

698
41:12
This proves to be really
difficult in the real world

699
41:16
because in the real world it's
hard to pull apart genes and

700
41:21
environments.
So, you and me will have

701
41:25
different personalities.
Why?

702
41:29
Well, we were raised by
different parents and we have

703
41:32
different genes.
We can't tell--My brother and

704
41:36
me might share all sorts of
things in common but we have the

705
41:41
same parents and the same genes,
fifty percent of the same genes.

706
41:45
So how do we tell what's
causing us to be alike?

707
41:48
So to do--to pull these things
apart you need to be clever.

708
41:53
You need to use the tools of
behavioral genetics.

709
41:56
And to use these tools you have
to exploit certain regularities

710
42:01
about genes and about
environment.

711
42:03
One thing is this.
Some people are clones.

712
42:09
Monozygotic twins are genetic
duplicates.

713
42:11
They share one hundred percent
of the same genes.

714
42:14
That's kind of interesting.
Dizygotic twins are not clones.

715
42:20
They share fifty/fifty.
They are just like regular

716
42:23
siblings.
And adopted siblings have no

717
42:27
special genetic overlap.
That's zero percent above and

718
42:32
beyond randomness.
Those three groups then become

719
42:36
rather interesting particularly
when we keep in mind that by

720
42:40
definition two people raised in
the same house by the same

721
42:44
parents have one hundred percent
the same shared environment.

722
42:48


723
42:52
So now, we can start to answer
these questions.

724
42:55
Suppose you find that
monozygotic twins are much more

725
42:59
similar than dizygotic twins.
Well, that would suggest that

726
43:03
there's a large role of genes in
those traits that you're

727
43:06
interested in.
It would not cinch the matter

728
43:09
because there are other factors
at work.

729
43:11
For instance,
monozygotic twins look more

730
43:14
alike than dizygotic twins and
maybe they have different

731
43:18
and--they have more similar
environments because of this

732
43:21
similarity in appearance.
Are monozygotic twins just as

733
43:26
similar as dizygotic twins?
If so, then it would show that

734
43:30
that extra overlap in genes
doesn't really matter.

735
43:34
And so, it would suggest a low
role of heredity.

736
43:38
Are adopted children highly
similar to their brothers and

737
43:42
sisters?
If so, then there's a high role

738
43:45
of shared environment.
Suppose the Bloom children,

739
43:49
and there are seven of them,
all have an IQ of 104 and we

740
43:54
adopt three kids and then at the
end of the day those three kids

741
43:59
each have an IQ of 104.
That would suggest that--And we

742
44:03
do this over and over again
across different families.

743
44:06
That would suggest that there's
something about the Bloom family

744
44:11
being raised by me that gives
you an IQ of 104.

745
44:16
On the other hand,
if the IQ of the adopted kids

746
44:19
had no relationship to those of
the biological Bloom children,

747
44:24
it would suggest that being
raised by me has no effects

748
44:26
really on your IQ.
It's sort of separate.

749
44:29
A separate--A second--A final
contrast, which is the thing

750
44:35
that psychologists love,
is identical twins reared

751
44:40
apart.
That's the gold standard

752
44:42
because you have these people
who are clones but they're

753
44:45
raised in different families.
And to the extent that they are

754
44:50
similar this suggests it's a
similarity of their genes.

755
44:54
And in fact,
one of the most surprising

756
44:57
findings in behavioral
genetics--The caption here is

757
45:01
"Separated at Birth,
the Mallifert Twins Meet

758
45:05
Accidentally."
ended up at a patent office

759
45:08
with the same device.
One of the hugely surprising

760
45:11
findings from behavioral
genetics is how alike identical

761
45:15
twins reared apart are.
They seem to have similar

762
45:18
attitudes to the death penalty,
to religion and to modern

763
45:21
music.
They have similar rates of

764
45:24
behavior in crime,
gambling and divorce.

765
45:26
They often have been found to
have bizarre similarities.

766
45:30
They meet after being separated
at birth and they meet at age

767
45:34
thirty and then it turns out
that they both get in to a lot

768
45:38
of trouble because they pretend
to sneeze in elevators.

769
45:41
There was one pair of twins
studied by behavioral genetics

770
45:45
who were known as the "Giggle
Twins" because they were--both

771
45:48
would always giggle,
they'd burst into giggles at

772
45:51
every moment even though it
couldn't be environment because

773
45:55
they weren't raised together.
More objectively,

774
45:58
the brain scans of identical
twins reared apart show that

775
46:04
their brains are so similar in
many cases you can't tell whose

776
46:10
brain is who.
I could tell your brain from my

777
46:13
brain from a brain scan and my
brother's brain from my brain

778
46:17
from a brain scan.
But if I were to have an

779
46:19
identical twin it would be very
difficult to tell whose brain is

780
46:23
whose even if we had no
environment in common.

781
46:25
So, this leads to two
surprising findings of

782
46:29
behavioral genetics.
This is the first one.

783
46:33
There is high heritability for
almost everything.

784
46:37
For intelligence,
for personality,

785
46:40
for how happy you are,
for how religious you are,

786
46:44
for your political orientation,
there--for your sexual

787
46:48
orientation, there is high
heritability.

788
46:51
There's a high effect of genes
for just about everything.

789
46:55
Now, that's actually not the
controversial thing I'm going to

790
46:59
tell you.
But before getting to the more

791
47:02
controversial thing I want to
raise another issue which often

792
47:05
gets discussed and has a good
treatment in the textbook.

793
47:08
This suggests that individual
differences within this--within

794
47:12
a group have genetic causes.
Does that mean that group

795
47:16
differences are largely the
result of genetic causes?

796
47:19
So, we know that there are
clear differences in IQ scores

797
47:23
among American racial groups,
between whites and Asians,

798
47:28
African Americans,
Ashkenazi Jews.

799
47:31
There's clear and reliable IQ
differences as well as some

800
47:34
other differences.
Now, to some extent,

801
47:37
these groups are partially
socially constructed.

802
47:41
And what this means is that
whether or not you fall into a

803
47:45
group it's not entirely
determined by your genetic

804
47:48
makeup.
It's often determined by social

805
47:50
decisions.
So, whether or not you count as

806
47:53
a Jew, for instance,
depends not entirely on genetic

807
47:56
factors but also on factors such
as whether you're reform or

808
48:00
orthodox and whether you--so
whether you would accept that a

809
48:04
child of a Jewish man and a
non-Jewish woman is Jewish.

810
48:08
Similarly, categories like
African American and white and

811
48:12
Asian often overlap broad
genetic categories and they

812
48:16
don't make fully coherent
genetic sense.

813
48:19
At the same time though,
there is plainly some genetic

814
48:23
differences across human groups
and say with regard to

815
48:27
vulnerability to disease.
Ashkenazi Jews for instance are

816
48:31
vulnerable to Tay-Sachs.
And the fact that you could

817
48:33
have this sort of genetic
vulnerability suggests that

818
48:36
there is some sort of reality to
these groups.

819
48:38
So, you have to ask the
question now,

820
48:41
to what extent does the high
heritability in individuals mean

821
48:46
that there has to be a heritable
explanation across groups?

822
48:51
And the answer is "not at all."
I'm not saying that this means

823
48:55
that there's no genetic
explanation for human group

824
48:58
differences.
All I'm saying is the question

825
49:01
of the phenomena
of--within-group genetic

826
49:04
differences does not mean that
there is across-group

827
49:09
genetic--sorry,
between-group genetic

828
49:12
differences.
There is a nice example by

829
49:15
Richard Lewontin,
the geneticist,

830
49:18
where he imagines two plots
of--what are you--some sort of

831
49:23
wheat,
yeah, two plots of land and

832
49:27
each one has a set of seeds
and--Oh, no.

833
49:30
They're over there.
No.

834
49:32
Anyway, one of them you
fertilize a lot.

835
49:35
The other one you fertilize a
little.

836
49:37
Now, within each plot how much
the seed grows is actually

837
49:41
largely determined by the
genetics of the seed.

838
49:45
And so, you'd find high
heritability for growth in the

839
49:49
seeds.
But the difference between

840
49:52
groups has no genetic cause at
all.

841
49:55
It's caused by which groups you
fertilize more than others.

842
49:59
Here's another way to do the
logic.

843
50:02
Suppose from the middle down
here, you guys,

844
50:06
I hate you, I really hate all
of you, and I like you,

845
50:11
so I make up two Midterms.
You probably didn't notice but

846
50:15
there were two Midterms.
This Midterm was fiercely hard,

847
50:19
savagely hard.
It took many of you until the

848
50:22
end of class to do it.
This Midterm was,

849
50:25
"Which is bigger,
a dog or an elephant?"

850
50:29
[laughter]
because I like you and I want

851
50:31
you all to succeed.
So, you have two different

852
50:34
groups, you guys and you guys.
Within each group some people

853
50:37
are going to do better than
others.

854
50:40
The explanation for that might
actually have to do with your

855
50:42
genes.
It might have to do with your

856
50:44
environment, how much you study,
but all sorts of reasons for

857
50:46
that.
Within each group some of you

858
50:48
will do better on the hard test
than others on the hard test,

859
50:51
some better on the easy test
than others on the easy test.

860
50:55
But how do we explain the group
difference?

861
50:57
Well, it has nothing to do with
genes.

862
50:59
The group difference,
the fact that you will do much

863
51:01
worse than you,
has to do with the exams I

864
51:03
give.
My point, again,

865
51:05
is that there is a logical
difference between a

866
51:07
within-group difference,
within this half of the class,

867
51:11
and a difference between
groups, within--between this

868
51:14
group and this group.
What do we know about--;So,

869
51:17
that just shows they're not the
same thing but what's the fact

870
51:21
of the matter?
What do we know about human

871
51:23
differences between different
human groups?

872
51:26
Again, the textbook has a good
discussion of this but I'm going

873
51:30
to give two reasons from the
textbook that at least group

874
51:34
differences are at least to a
large extent due to

875
51:37
environmental and not genetic
causes.

876
51:40
One is that the differences we
find in IQ seem to correspond

877
51:44
better to socially defined
groups than genetically defined

878
51:48
groups.
They seem to correspond to

879
51:50
groups defined in terms of how
people treat you and how people

880
51:54
think about you as opposed to
your DNA.

881
51:56
And to the extent that turns
out to be true that would mean

882
52:00
that a genetic explanation is
not reasonable for those

883
52:04
differences.
A second factor is that we know

884
52:08
IQ can differ radically without
any genetic differences at all.

885
52:15
And the most dramatic evidence
of that is the Flynn effect.

886
52:20
The Flynn effect is one of the
freakier findings.

887
52:24
The Flynn effect is the finding
that people have been getting

888
52:28
smarter.
You are much smarter on average

889
52:34
than your parents if--and the IQ
tests hide that.

890
52:42
Here is why they hide that.
They hide that because they

891
52:45
always make 100 the average.
So, you come home and you say,

892
52:49
"Dad, Dad, I just did an IQ
test.

893
52:52
I got 120."
And your father says,

894
52:55
"Good work, Son.
I got 122 when I was your age,"

895
52:59
but what neither of you
acknowledge is your test was

896
53:03
much harder.
As people got better,

897
53:06
they had to make the test
harder and harder.

898
53:08
And this is plotted by the
Flynn effect.

899
53:10
One of these lines is American
and one is Dutch.

900
53:19
I don't know which is which but
the gist of it is that somebody

901
53:25
who would have--that if you in
1980 would take the 1950 test,

902
53:31
your average person in 1980
would score 120 on the 1950

903
53:35
test.
What this means is if you take

904
53:38
your person who's average now
and push him back through time

905
53:43
twenty years,
thirty years,

906
53:45
he would do much better than
average.

907
53:48
Nobody knows why people are
getting smarter and there's

908
53:53
different theories of this.
And in fact,

909
53:56
well, wait until you see your
reading response.

910
54:00
But what this illustrates is
that IQ can change dramatically

911
54:06
over the span of a few decades
without any corresponding

912
54:11
genetic change.
And that leaves open the

913
54:15
possibility, in fact,
maybe the likelihood,

914
54:18
that the differences we find in
human groups,

915
54:21
existing human groups,
are caused by the same

916
54:23
environmental effects that have
led to the Flynn effect.

917
54:26
Okay.
This is not the surprising

918
54:28
claim though,
the high heritability for

919
54:30
almost everything.
This is the surprising claim.

920
54:33
Almost everything that's not
genetic is due to non-shared

921
54:37
environments.
The behavioral genetic analyses

922
54:41
suggest that shared environment
counts for little or nothing.

923
54:47
When it comes to personality or
intelligence then,

924
54:51
an adopted child is no more
similar to his siblings than he

925
54:56
or she is to a stranger.
To put it a different way,

926
55:00
the IQ correlation in
genetically unrelated adults who

927
55:03
are raised in the same family is
about zero.

928
55:05
Suppose the Bloom family all
has an IQ of 104 and we adopt a

929
55:10
kid.
What will this kid's--We adopt

930
55:12
him as a baby.
We raise him to be a

931
55:15
twenty-year-old.
What's his IQ?

932
55:17
Answer?
We have no idea because the IQ

933
55:20
of the Bloom family who are
unrelated to him has no effect

934
55:24
at all.
Now, if you think about the

935
55:27
implications of it,
it becomes controversial and

936
55:30
Newsweek,
I think, caught the big issue

937
55:34
when they put in their title the
question "do parents matter?"

938
55:38
And the question--And the issue
is parents are shared

939
55:42
environment.
To say shared environment does

940
55:46
not affect your intelligence or
your personality suggests that

941
55:51
how your parents raised you does
not affect your gene--your

942
55:56
intelligence or your
personality.

943
55:59
This isn't to say your parents
didn't have a big effect on your

944
56:03
intelligence and personality.
Your parents had a huge effect

945
56:08
on your intelligence and your
personality, around 0.5

946
56:11
actually.
They had this effect at the

947
56:13
moment of conception.
From then on in,

948
56:16
they played very little role in
shaping you--what you are.

949
56:20
The case for this which
generated the Newsweek

950
56:23
cover came up in a controversial
book by Judith Harris called

951
56:27
The Nurture Assumption
which has a very long subtitle,

952
56:31
"Why Parents Turn--Why Children
Turn Out the Way They Do,

953
56:34
Parents Matter Less than You
Think and Peers Matter More."

954
56:38
Judith Harris has had an
interesting history.

955
56:43
She was kicked out of graduate
school at Harvard and told that

956
56:47
she wouldn't amount to much.
The person who wrote the letter

957
56:51
saying that she was not going to
amount to much was the

958
56:54
department chair,
George Miller.

959
56:55
In 1997, she won the George
Miller award for her astounding

960
57:00
accomplishments.
And when she wrote the book she

961
57:03
took as a starting point,
her point of disagreement,

962
57:07
a famous poem by the poet
Philip Larkin and many of you

963
57:10
have probably heard this.
The poem goes like this:

964
57:14
They fuck you up,
your mum and dad.

965
57:16
They may not mean to but they
do.

966
57:18
They fill you with the faults
they had And add some extra just

967
57:23
for you.
The last line of the poem,

968
57:26
the last bit of the poem,
ends: "Man hands on misery to

969
57:31
man.
It deepens like a coastal shelf.

970
57:34
Get out as early as you can and
don't have any kids yourself."

971
57:38
It's beautiful.
[laughter]

972
57:40
Harris wrote a rebuttal:
"How sharper than a serpent's

973
57:45
tooth to hear your child make
such a fuss.

974
57:49
It isn't fair.
It's not the truth.

975
57:52
He's fucked up,
yes, but not by us."

976
57:56
[laughter]
Just to show that academic

977
57:58
debates never end,
a British psychoanalyst named

978
58:01
Oliver James,
outraged by Judith Harris' book

979
58:05
The Nurture Assumption,
wrote another book in response

980
58:09
called They Fuck You Up.
[laughter]

981
58:13
Now, how do you tell your
grandparents,

982
58:16
"I wrote a book."
"What's it called?"

983
58:19
"Can't tell you."
[laughter] Anyway, look.

984
58:25
If you're paying attention,
this has to sound wrong.

985
58:28
You must be thinking of course
there must be an effect of

986
58:32
shared environment.
Of course parents have an

987
58:34
effect.
After all, good kids have good

988
58:38
parents.
There is no doubt at all that

989
58:41
this is true.
There is a high correlation

990
58:44
between parent and child for
everything.

991
58:46
If your parents read a lot and
there's a lot of books in your

992
58:49
house, you will become a reader.
If your parents are religious,

993
58:52
you will be religious.
If you're raised by Bonnie and

994
58:57
Clyde, you will be a young thug.
[laughter]

995
59:01
If your parents are poor,
you're likely to be poor.

996
59:03
If your parents are brilliant,
you're likely to be brilliant.

997
59:06
No doubt at all.
It is an extremely robust

998
59:09
correlation.
But the problem is this

999
59:11
correlation could be explained
in different ways.

1000
59:14
Everybody thinks it's because
parents do something that

1001
59:17
affects their kids.
Your parents are bookish,

1002
59:20
they read to their kids,
so their kids become bookish,

1003
59:23


1004
59:26
but another possibility,
which we know is true,

1005
59:29
that almost always parents
share their genes with their

1006
59:34
kids.
Another possibility is it's the

1007
59:36
parents who are
affecting--sorry,

1008
59:38
it's the child who is affecting
the parents,

1009
59:41
not vice versa,
and to illustrate this,

1010
59:44
these different possibilities,
I want to tell you a little bit

1011
59:49
about a study.
And I really find this a

1012
59:52
fascinating study.
It was reported last year and

1013
59:55
it was a study shown
that--suggesting that family

1014
59:58
meals help teens avoid smoking,
alcohol, drugs.

1015
60:02
It involved a phone
questionnaire where they phoned

1016
60:04
up teenagers and their parents
and said, "Hey,

1017
60:07
teenager.
Do you do a lot of drugs?"

1018
60:09
"Yes."
"Do you have dinner with your

1019
60:12
parents?"
"No."

1020
60:14
And they take it off--and then
they ask other people and they

1021
60:19
find that the kids who are the
good kids have meals with their

1022
60:24
parents,
suggesting this headline.

1023
60:27
I like this study because I
have read--I must have read in

1024
60:31
my career a thousand studies and
this is the worst study ever

1025
60:35
done [laughter]
in the history of science.

1026
60:38
And it's almost--We could
devote a week to discussing

1027
60:43
what's wrong with this study.
Let's just--But here's the idea.

1028
60:48
It is possible that they are
right.

1029
60:52
It is actually
possible--there's no--I have no

1030
60:55
evidence against it – that
having meals with your kids

1031
60:58
makes them into good,
drug-free, non-promiscuous,

1032
61:02
non-drinking kids.
Of course, it's equally

1033
61:05
possible it's the other way
around.

1034
61:07
If little Johnny is kind of--is
out there smoking pot and

1035
61:12
cavorting with prostitutes and
stuff like that,

1036
61:17
he's not going to come home for
the family meal.

1037
61:19
It's the other way around.
While if he's a good kid,

1038
61:22
he might be more likely to have
a family meal.

1039
61:24
So, the direction--It might
actually be not family meals

1040
61:27
make good kids but rather good
kids stick around to have--if

1041
61:31
they have nothing better to do
and have meals with Mom and Dad.

1042
61:35
[laughter]
Another possibility is there's

1043
61:38
good families and bad families.
A good family is likely to have

1044
61:42
drug-free kids and a family
meal.

1045
61:44
A bad family is likely to have
stoned kids and no family meal.

1046
61:48
[laughter]
So, there--maybe there's an

1047
61:49
effect of that.
The parents had nothing to do

1048
61:51
with the family meal.
Here's the even weirder part.

1049
61:55
They didn't factor out age so
think about this.

1050
61:59
Their sample included children
ranging from twelve to seventeen

1051
62:02
but let me tell you something
about twelve-year-olds.

1052
62:05
Twelve-year-olds don't use a
lot of drugs and are likely to

1053
62:10
eat with their family.
Seventeen-year-olds are stoned

1054
62:14
all the time and they don't eat
with their family.

1055
62:17
[laughter]
I've just begun on this study

1056
62:20
but the point is when you hear
something like--So now,

1057
62:24
take something which you may be
more likely to believe.

1058
62:27
Maybe you believe that having
parents who read to their kids,

1059
62:30
that's good for their kids.
Well, maybe it is but most of

1060
62:34
these criticisms apply to that
study too.

1061
62:39
A bookish kid is more likely to
get his parents to read to him.

1062
62:43
A good family--Parents who are
good parents in general are more

1063
62:48
likely to do all sorts of good
things to their kids and have

1064
62:52
good kids besides.
Take another case,

1065
62:55
the so-called cycle of
violence.

1066
62:57
Yes, it's true.
Parents who smack their kids

1067
63:01
tend to have statistically more
violent kids.

1068
63:04
But maybe the causality goes
the other way around.

1069
63:08
Maybe if you have a kid who is
a troublemaker you're more

1070
63:11
likely to smack him.
Maybe, which seems to be

1071
63:14
entirely likely,
the propensity for violence is

1072
63:17
to some extent heritable.
And so, even if the kid was not

1073
63:21
raised by the smacking parent,
whatever properties of that

1074
63:24
parent caused him--led to that
violence got inherited by the

1075
63:28
kid.
Now, again, this isn't going to

1076
63:30
sit right for you and I've
had--I put this down because

1077
63:33
last year when I gave this talk
people ran up to me and told me

1078
63:36
this.
They said, "Look.

1079
63:38
I know my mom and dad had a
huge role in my life.

1080
63:40
That's why I'm so happy and
successful," then other people

1081
63:44
said, "That's why I'm so
miserable and screwed up,"

1082
63:47
but either way blame it on Mom
and Dad or thank Mom and Dad.

1083
63:51
And you might think you know.
When you become famous and you

1084
63:56
stand up and you get your awards
maybe you'll thank your mom and

1085
63:59
dad.
When you go to your therapist

1086
64:00
and explain why you're so
screwed up maybe you'll blame

1087
64:03
Dad.
"He never took me to a baseball

1088
64:05
game."
Well, maybe,

1089
64:07
[laughter]
but you don't know.

1090
64:10
Were you adopted?
If you weren't adopted,

1091
64:15
you can't even begin to have
the conversation about how your

1092
64:18
parents messed you up because if
you're a lot like your parents

1093
64:21
you might be a lot like your
parents because you share their

1094
64:24
genes.
Of course, you resemble your

1095
64:26
parents.
Moreover, how do you figure out

1096
64:28
which is the cause and which is
the effect?

1097
64:31
"Mom smacked me a lot and
that's why I turned out to be

1098
64:34
such a rotten person."
Well, maybe she smacked you

1099
64:37
because you were rotten.
[laughter]

1100
64:39
I don't want to get personal
but it's very difficult to pull

1101
64:45
these things apart.
A final point on this.

1102
64:48


1103
64:51
One response to Harris' book is
this.

1104
64:55
"Look.
Even if this is true,

1105
64:57
you shouldn't let this get out
because if parents don't mold

1106
65:01
their children's personalities
maybe why should they treat

1107
65:05
their kids nicely?"
And you might be wondering this.

1108
65:08
You might be thinking,
well, gee, if you don't have

1109
65:12
any effect on how your kids turn
out, why be nice to them,

1110
65:16
but there are answers.
You might want to be nice to

1111
65:19
them because you love them.
You might want to be nice to

1112
65:22
them because you want them to be
happy.

1113
65:23
You might want to be nice to
them because you want to have

1114
65:26
good relationships with them.
And I have a little bit more

1115
65:29
but I'm going to skip it and I'm
going to move right to your

1116
65:32
reading response,
which is very,

1117
65:34
very simple,
easy to answer,

1118
65:36
easy to grade:
Explain the Flynn effect.

1119
65:39
It's a toughie so just explain
that.

1120
65:42
Okay.
Have a wonderful spring break

1121
65:46
and I'll see you when you get
back.

1122
65:49
