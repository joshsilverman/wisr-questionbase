Professor Paul Bloom:
This is going to begin a

2
0:16
two-lecture sequence on social
psychology on how we think about

3
0:20
ourselves, how we think about
other people,

4
0:22
how we think about other groups
of people.

5
0:25
We've talked a lot about the
capacities of the human mind and

6
0:31
some of these capacities involve
adapting and dealing with the

7
0:36
material world.
So, we have to choose foods,

8
0:39
we have to navigate around the
world, we have to recognize

9
0:43
objects,
we have to be able to

10
0:46
understand physical
interactions.

11
0:49
But probably the most
interesting aspect of our

12
0:52
evolved minds is our capacity to
understand and deal with other

13
0:57
people.
We are intensely interested in

14
1:00
how other people work.
The story that was a dominant

15
1:06
news story in 2005 was this.
And some of you--this--for

16
1:12
those of you who aren't seeing
the screen, is the separation of

17
1:16
Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt.
I remember where I was when I

18
1:21
first heard about this.
[laughter]

19
1:24
And it's an interesting sight.
Just remember--stepping back.

20
1:29
As psychologists we have to
question the natural.

21
1:32
We have to take things that are
commonsense and explore them.

22
1:36
And one thing which just
happens is, we're fascinated by

23
1:39
this stuff.
We're fascinated by the lives

24
1:42
of celebrities.
We're fascinated by the social

25
1:44
lives of other people.
And it's an interesting

26
1:48
question to ask why.
And this is one of the

27
1:52
questions which I'm going to
deal with in the next couple of

28
1:56
lectures but before I get to the
theory of social psychology I

29
2:00
want to talk about an individual
difference.

30
2:03
So, we devoted a lecture early
on--of a couple of weeks ago,

31
2:07
to individual differences
across people in intelligence

32
2:11
and personality.
I want to talk a little bit

33
2:14
about an individual difference
in our social natures and then I

34
2:18
want people to do a test that
will explore where you stand on

35
2:22
a continuum.
That test is the piece of paper

36
2:25
you have in front of you.
Anybody who doesn't have it

37
2:28
please raise your hand and one
of the teaching fellows will

38
2:30
bring it to you.
You don't know what to do yet

39
2:33
with it so don't worry.
The test was developed actually

40
2:37
by Malcolm Gladwell who is a
science writer--in his wonderful

41
2:41
book The Tipping Point.
And as he introduces the test,

42
2:45
Gladwell recounts another
experiment done by Stanley

43
2:49
Milgram, of course famous for
his obedience work but he did a

44
2:53
lot of interesting things.
And one classic study he did

45
2:58
was he gave a package to 160
people randomly chosen in Omaha,

46
3:04
Nebraska and he asked these
people to get the package

47
3:09
somehow – and this was many
years ago before the internet,

48
3:14
before e-mail – to get the
package to a stockbroker who

49
3:18
worked in Boston but lived in
Sharon,

50
3:21
Massachusetts.
What he found was that most

51
3:25
people were able to do it.
Nobody, of course,

52
3:28
knew this man but they knew
people who might know people who

53
3:32
would know this man.
So, most people succeeded.

54
3:35
Most people were able to get
the packages to this man and it

55
3:41
took at maximum six degrees of
separation,

56
3:45
which is where the famous
phrase comes about that we're

57
3:48
all separated from another
person by six degrees of

58
3:51
separation.
This is not true in general.

59
3:54
This was a very--a single
experiment done within the

60
3:57
United States,
but the idea is appealing,

61
3:59
that people are connected to
one another via chains of

62
4:05
people.
But what Milgram found that was

63
4:09
particularly interesting was
that in about half of the cases

64
4:15
these packages went through two
people.

65
4:19
That is, if you plot the
relationships between people--We

66
4:25
can take each person in this
room,

67
4:28
find everybody you know and who
knows you and draw a line,

68
4:33
but if we were to do this you
wouldn't find an even mesh of

69
4:37
wires.
Rather, you'd find that some

70
4:40
people are clusters.
Some people are what Gladwell

71
4:43
calls "connectors."
It's like air traffic.

72
4:45
Air traffic used to be
everything flew to places local

73
4:50
to it but now there's a system
of hubs,

74
4:53
Chicago O'Hare for instance or
Newark where planes fly through.

75
4:58
Some people are hubs.
Some people are the sort of

76
5:03
people who know a lot of people.
Some people in this room might

77
5:08
be hubs, and it is not
impossible to find out.

78
5:12
The piece of paper you have
here is 250 names chosen

79
5:17
randomly from a Manhattan phone
book.

80
5:21
They capture a range of
ethnicities, different parts of

81
5:26
the world, different national
origins.

82
5:30
Here's what I'd like you to do.
And I'll give about five

83
5:33
minutes for this.
Go through these names and

84
5:36
circle how many people you know.
Now, the rules of this are,

85
5:43
to know somebody you have
to--they have to know you back.

86
5:48
So, if it's a celebrity--Well,
here--one of the names here is

87
5:56
Johnson.
Now, I've heard of Magic

88
5:59
Johnson but Magic Johnson has
never heard of me,

89
6:02
so I cannot circle it.
On the other hand,

90
6:04
our department chair is Marcia
Johnson.

91
6:06
She has heard of me,
so I could circle it.

92
6:09
Go through and circle it.
Circle all the people you know

93
6:14
who know you.
Those are the people you're

94
6:17
connected to.
If you know more than one

95
6:19
person with the same last name,
circle it twice.

96
6:23
If you don't have this piece of
paper and you want to

97
6:24
participate, please raise your
hand and one of the teaching

98
6:26
fellows will bring it to you.

99
6:28


100
8:06
I'm going to talk a little bit
more about this while people go

101
8:09
through this.
The issue of connections

102
8:12
between people is intellectually
interesting for many reasons and

103
8:17
might allow us to develop some
generalizations about how people

104
8:22
interact.
The game of Six Degrees of

105
8:25
Separation has,
of course, turned into a famous

106
8:29
movie trivia thing revolving
around the actor Kevin Bacon,

107
8:34
I think chosen just because it
rhymes with "separation."

108
8:38
And the game of "Six Degrees of
Kevin Bacon" is played by taking

109
8:43
any actor and computing how many
steps it would take to get to

110
8:47
Kevin Bacon.
And some computer scientists

111
8:50
have developed this.
They've gone through each of

112
8:53
the quarter million actors and
actresses on the international

113
8:57
movie database and computed
their "Bacon number."

114
9:00
And the Bacon number is the
number of steps it takes for

115
9:05
them to get to Kevin Bacon.
So for instance,

116
9:09
Ed Asner was in the movie
Change of--;"JFK" with Kevin

117
9:16
Bacon.
So, Ed Asner has a Bacon number

118
9:20
of one.
Elvis Presley was in the movie

119
9:23
"Change of Habit" with Ed Asner
and that's his closest

120
9:27
connection to Kevin Bacon.
So, Elvis Presley has a Bacon

121
9:32
number of two.
It turns out that if you look

122
9:35
at the 2.5--sorry,
the quarter million people on

123
9:39
the movie database and compute
their Bacon number,

124
9:44
the average Bacon number is 2.8.
That's how many steps your

125
9:48
average person is away from
Kevin Bacon.

126
9:51
You could then,
for any actor or actress,

127
9:55
compute the most connected one.
So, the most connected one

128
10:00
would be the one for whom the
quarter million are,

129
10:03
on average, the most connected
to.

130
10:05
And the answer of the most
connected actor or actress is

131
10:09
reasonably surprising.
Does anybody want to guess?

132
10:11


133
10:15
I'll start you off with the
wrong answer and this,

134
10:19
by the way, can be found on
this web site.

135
10:21
It's not John Wayne.
John Wayne has been in many

136
10:26
movies, 180 movies,
in fact, over sixty years,

137
10:29
but he isn't well connected at
all because mostly he was in

138
10:34
westerns so we saw the same
people over and over again.

139
10:38


140
10:43
Meryl Streep also isn't it
because Meryl Streep has the

141
10:47
misfortune of playing only in
good movies.

142
10:51
[laughter]
So, she has no connection with

143
10:54
people like Adam Sandler and
John-Claude Van Damme.

144
10:57
[laughter] Guess.
Any guesses?

145
11:02
Student:
Christopher Walken

146
11:02
Student:
Nicholas Cage Professor Paul

147
11:03
Bloom: Christopher Walken is
a good one.

148
11:04
We could look it up.
I only know a few names here.

149
11:07
Christopher Walken is not a
finalist.

150
11:09
Nicolas Cage is an interesting
case.

151
11:11
Has Nicolas Cage been in good
movies?

152
11:14
I don't want to get--I'm going
to get more controversial than I

153
11:18
want to.
Student:

154
11:21
A guy who is one step above an
extra.

155
11:27
He's like a B-list actor at
best.

156
11:29
The most connected guy,
and I think this shows that

157
11:34
you're right,
is Rod Steiger.

158
11:36
He's the most connected actor
in the history of acting because

159
11:40
it isn't that he's been in more
movies than everybody else.

160
11:44
Michael Caine has probably been
in the most movies of any person

161
11:48
on earth, but he's been in all
sorts of movies.

162
11:50
He was in "On the Waterfront,"
"In the Heat of the Night," and

163
11:54
really bad movies like
"Carpool."

164
11:56
He's been in dramas and crime
serials, thrillers,

165
12:00
westerns, horror movies,
science fiction,

166
12:03
musicals.
Now, some people are like Rod

167
12:08
Steiger.
So, some people in their

168
12:11
day-to-day lives have many
interactions and I think one of

169
12:15
the things we know from
interacting with people is we

170
12:18
can distinguish them from other
people.

171
12:21
How many people have finished
their things right now?

172
12:24
Okay.
I know one person in the

173
12:26
department who is one of the
most connected people I know on

174
12:30
earth.
If I wanted--If I really had to

175
12:33
talk to Rumsfeld,
I'd go to this person and say,

176
12:36
"Can you get me in touch with
Rumsfeld?"

177
12:39
If I wanted to get somebody
whacked, I'd ask this guy.

178
12:43
[laughter]
Then I know someone else in the

179
12:45
department and,
as best I know,

180
12:46
I'm the only person she knows.
[laughter]

181
12:50
So, how many people scores
below ten on this?

182
12:58


183
13:01
How many between ten and twenty?
Between twenty and thirty?

184
13:07
Thirty and forty?
Between forty and fifty?

185
13:15
Fifty and sixty?
How many people scored above

186
13:21
sixty?
Anybody above sixty?

187
13:28
Gladwell has done this in a lot
of places.

188
13:31
The average is twenty-one among
a college crowd.

189
13:36
Some people score as high as
over 100.

190
13:40
The older you are,
the more--the higher you tend

191
13:43
to score, maybe obviously,
not--the longer you've been in

192
13:46
the country the higher you tend
to score.

193
13:49
Journalists tend to score
reasonably high,

194
13:52
academics not so high,
and--but what Gladwell points

195
13:56
out is some people have the
gift.

196
13:59
Some people are more social
than others and this connects in

197
14:03
all sorts of interesting ways.
The issue of connection has

198
14:08
social factors and it's one
answer that sociologists give

199
14:15
for why it's good to go to Yale.
So, one answer is,

200
14:21
well, because of the great
intellectual benefits.

201
14:26
Put that aside.
Let's be more cynical here.

202
14:30
Another answer is that you
develop powerful friends.

203
14:36
And that's closer,
but the interesting answer

204
14:40
sociologists come to is it's not
so much you develop powerful

205
14:44
friends;
rather, you develop powerful

206
14:48
acquaintances.
Through Yale you know a lot of

207
14:51
people and they don't have to be
close friends but they are

208
14:55
acquaintances.
And sociologists point out that

209
14:58
for a lot of aspects of your
life, like getting a job,

210
15:02
acquaintances matter,
connections matter,

211
15:04
and the connections you
establish by going to a place

212
15:07
like Yale hold you in good stead
for the rest of your life,

213
15:11
above and beyond any
intellectual qualities that this

214
15:14
place may offer.

215
15:15


216
15:19
Here's what we're going to do
for the next lecture and a half,

217
15:21
two lectures.
We're first going to talk about

218
15:23
the self.
Then we're going to talk about

219
15:25
the self and other;
basically, differences between

220
15:28
how we think of ourselves and
how we think about other people.

221
15:33
Then we're going to talk
exclusively about how we think

222
15:35
about other people and then
we'll talk about how we think

223
15:38
about groups like Harvard
students or gay people or black

224
15:41
people.

225
15:41


226
15:45
I'll start with my favorite
finding of all time and this is

227
15:50
about the self.
And this is about the spotlight

228
15:56
effect.
So, my mornings are often

229
15:59
rushed because I have two kids.
So, I get up and sometimes I

230
16:03
don't set the alarm and I get up
late;

231
16:05
I stagger out of bed;
I wake the kids;

232
16:07
I greet the servants;
I get ready;

233
16:10
[laughter] I make breakfast.
I run out of the house and then

234
16:14
usually around 3 o'clock
somebody points out,

235
16:17
in one case a homeless man,
that I have a big glob of

236
16:20
shaving cream in my ear
or--because I neglected to

237
16:23
actually look in the mirror
while I shaved.

238
16:25
Or I have once been to a party
and I found my shirt was

239
16:29
misaligned, seriously
misaligned,

240
16:31
not one button but--Anyway,
[laughter]

241
16:35
so--and so I feel when this
happens I'm very immature.

242
16:39
And I basically feel this is
the end of the world,

243
16:42
this is humiliating and
everybody notices.

244
16:45
And so the question is,
how many people notice when

245
16:49
something happens?
And the spotlight effect--Well,

246
16:52
before talking about my
favorite experiment ever,

247
16:56
there is an episode of "The
Simpsons" that provides a

248
16:58
beautiful illustration of the
spotlight effect.

249
17:01
And then it has a beautiful
illustration of psychological

250
17:05
testing, so I'll give you them
quickly one after the other.

251
17:10
So, Tom Gilovich,
a social psychologist,

252
17:13
was interested in the question
of the spotlight effect,

253
17:18
which is when we wear a pink
shirt to work,

254
17:20
shaving cream in our ear or
whatever,

255
17:23
do we systematically
overestimate how much other

256
17:28
people notice?
He did a series of experiments.

257
17:32
And in one experiment what he
did was he got in the subjects

258
17:37
– standard Intro Psych drill
– and said,

259
17:40
"I want you to wear a T-shirt
for the next day and I want it

260
17:45
to have a picture on it,"
and he got them to wear

261
17:49
T-shirts that had pictures on it
that were the most embarrassing

262
17:53
pictures that they could have on
it.

263
17:56
It turns out that if you ask
people what's the worst picture

264
17:59
to have on the T-shirt that you
are wearing,

265
18:02
the number one answer is Hitler
tied with Barry Manilow.

266
18:11
[laughter]
The best pictures to have on

267
18:17
your T-shirt are Martin Luther
King Jr.

268
18:22
and Jerry Seinfeld.
It turns out that people--And

269
18:26
then he had them go about their
day and asked them,

270
18:29
"How many people noticed your
T-shirt?"

271
18:32
And then the psychologists went
around and they asked the

272
18:36
people, "How many of you noticed
this person's T-shirt?"

273
18:40
And it turned out they got it
wrong by a factor of about two.

274
18:45
They thought,
say, 100 noticed,

275
18:48
but fifty people noticed.
And across study after study

276
18:53
after study Gilovich and his
colleagues have found support

277
18:56
for the spotlight effect,
which is that you believe that

278
19:00
people are noticing you all the
time but they aren't.

279
19:04
They're busy noticing
themselves.

280
19:06
And this is actually a useful
thing to know.

281
19:12
Gilovich got interested in this
because he's interested in the

282
19:17
psychology of regret.
And it turns out that if you

283
19:21
actually ask dying people,
or really old people basically,

284
19:25
"What do you regret from your
life?"

285
19:27
they regret the things as a
rule that they didn't try.

286
19:33
But when you asked them why
they didn't try it the answers

287
19:37
tended to be "I would look
silly."

288
19:40
And it turns out,
interesting to know,

289
19:42
that people just don't care as
much as other people think you

290
19:46
are.
You could take that as good

291
19:49
news or bad news but the
spotlight is not on us as much

292
19:53
as we think it is.
There's a second effect

293
19:56
Gilovich discovers called "the
transparency effect."

294
20:00
And the transparency effect is
quite interesting.

295
20:03
The transparency effect is that
we believe that we're more

296
20:10
transparent than we are.
I need somebody up here who

297
20:17
thinks that he or she is a bad
liar.

298
20:22


299
20:26
Just--I just need you to say
three sentences.

300
20:29
I'll even tell you what it is
ahead of time.

301
20:31
I'm going to ask you three
questions: "Have you been in

302
20:34
London?
Do you have a younger sibling?"

303
20:36
and "Do you like sushi?"
I want you to answer with one

304
20:39
of those answers there.
I want you to lie about one of

305
20:44
them.
The task will be for everybody

306
20:47
else to recognize and guess
which one you're lying about.

307
20:51
Do you want to go up?
Yeah.

308
20:54
And I will even write down
which one you should lie on.

309
20:58
So, I want you to lie as to
that number.

310
21:02
Okay?

311
21:03


312
21:10
Have you ever been in London?
Student:

313
21:15
No, I have not been in London.
Professor Paul Bloom:

314
21:19
Do you have a younger sibling?
Student:

315
21:21
Yes, I have a younger sibling.
Professor Paul Bloom:

316
21:24
Do you like sushi?
Student:

317
21:26
No, I do not like sushi.
Professor Paul Bloom:

318
21:29
Okay.
Let's have a vote.

319
21:30
She was lying about one of them.
Who votes for one?

320
21:36
Who votes for two?
Who votes for three?

321
21:42
Pretty much of a tie between
two and three.

322
21:45
You could say which one you
were lying.

323
21:47
Student: Three.
Professor Paul Bloom:

324
21:52
The effect--there are two
aspects of the effect.

325
21:54
One aspect is people are
actually quite good at lying.

326
22:00
It is a rare person who
couldn't stand up there and

327
22:04
everybody would figure out what
they're lying about,

328
22:09
but the transparency effect is
we don't feel that way.

329
22:14
We often feel like things bleed
out of us and so people will

330
22:18
systematically overestimate the
extent to which other people

331
22:21
notice their secrets.
And this is actually,

332
22:24
in general, why it's sometimes
difficult to teach or to tell

333
22:29
stories because we constantly
overestimate how much other

334
22:33
people know.
We think of ourselves as more

335
22:37
transparent than we are.
A second social psychological

336
22:42
phenomena is you think you're
terrific.

337
22:45
If I asked people,
"How well are you doing in

338
22:50
Intro Psych this semester?"
and I asked you to give

339
22:55
yourself a percentage rating
relative to the rest of the

340
22:59
class,
then if everybody was accurate,

341
23:02
or at least not systematically
biased, the number should add up

342
23:07
to 50%.
Roughly half of you are doing

343
23:10
better than average and roughly
half of you are doing worse than

344
23:13
average.
It turns out though that people

345
23:15
will systematically and
dramatically view themselves as

346
23:20
better than average.
They will view themselves as

347
23:24
better than average when asked
how good they are as a student,

348
23:28
as a teacher,
as a lover, and particularly,

349
23:32
as a driver.
[laughter]

350
23:34
Everybody who drives thinks
that he or she is a wonderful

351
23:37
driver.
This has been called the "Lake

352
23:40
Wobegon effect" based on
Garrison Keillor's story about a

353
23:45
place where all the children are
above average.

354
23:48
And the Lake Wobegon effect in
psychology involves a systematic

355
23:53
bias to see ourselves as better
than average.

356
23:57
What psychologists don't really
know is why the Lake Wobegon

357
24:02
effect exists,
and there are a couple of

358
24:05
proposals.
One is the nature of the

359
24:09
feedback we get.
So, for a lot of aspects of

360
24:13
your life you only get feedback
when you're good,

361
24:17
when you do something good.
In a normal,

362
24:20
productive, healthy,
happy environment,

363
24:22
people don't scream at you
about how bad you're doing but

364
24:25
they compliment how good you are
and that could lead to an

365
24:28
inflated self-esteem on the part
of people in certain domains.

366
24:32
Another possibility is there's
different criteria for goodness.

367
24:36
For a driver,
for instance,

368
24:38
when I ask you to rank how good
you are as a driver,

369
24:42
what people often do is they
think--they say,

370
24:45
"I'm better than average," but
what they do is they focus on

371
24:50
one aspect of their driving.
So, some of you might say,

372
24:53
"Hey, I'm just a great parallel
parker so I'm a great driver."

373
24:57
Others might say,
"I'm very careful,

374
24:59
great driver."
Others might say,

375
25:01
"I take chances no one else
will--great driver," [laughter]

376
25:06
but above and beyond that there
does seem to be a psychological

377
25:10
effect manifested here and
manifested elsewhere,

378
25:14
which is a motivation to feel
good about yourself.

379
25:17
You think you're important,
which is why the spotlight

380
25:22
effect exists.
You think your thoughts bleed

381
25:25
out, which is why the
transparency effect exists.

382
25:29
But above and beyond that,
in a normal,

383
25:32
healthy mind you think you're
terrific.

384
25:35
And so, this shows up in all
sorts of ways.

385
25:38
It shows up as well in what's
been called "the self-serving

386
25:42
bias."
Half of you did above average

387
25:46
on the Midterm;
half of you did below average

388
25:50
on the Midterm,
but if I went up and asked each

389
25:54
of you why the answers would not
be symmetrical.

390
25:58
People who did well in the
Midterm would describe it in

391
26:01
terms of their capacities or
abilities.

392
26:04
They'd say, "It's because I'm
smart, hardworking,

393
26:08
brilliant."
People who did poorly would

394
26:11
say, "The Midterm was unfair.
I was busy.

395
26:14
I have better things to do with
my time."

396
26:17
Professors as well--When people
get papers accepted it is

397
26:23
because the papers are
brilliant.

398
26:27
When they got them rejected
it's because there's a

399
26:30
conspiracy against them by
jealous editors and reviewers.

400
26:34
There is this asymmetry all the
time.

401
26:36
The asymmetry has been found in
athletes, in CEOs and in

402
26:40
accident reports.
And again, this is sort of a

403
26:43
positive enhancement technique.
You think that you're terrific

404
26:48
and because you're terrific the
good things that happen to you

405
26:53
are due to your terrific-ness;
the bad things are due to

406
26:57
accident and misfortune.

407
26:58


408
27:01
The final aspect of self that I
want to talk about is the idea

409
27:05
that what you do makes sense.
And this is one of the more

410
27:10
interesting sub domains of
social psychology.

411
27:13
The idea was developed by the
social psychologist Leon

412
27:17
Festinger and it's called
"Cognitive Dissonance Theory."

413
27:21
And what Festinger was
interested in was the idea that

414
27:25
what happens when people
experience an inconsistency in

415
27:29
their heads.
And he claimed it causes an

416
27:32
unpleasant emotional state,
what he described as

417
27:35
"dissonance."
And he argued that we act so as

418
27:39
to reduce dissonance.
When there's a contradiction in

419
27:43
our heads we're not happy and
will take steps to make the

420
27:46
contradiction go away.
This all sounds very general

421
27:50
but there are some striking
demonstrations of this and how

422
27:54
it could work in everyday life.
So, this very simple example is

423
28:00
that--is the confirmation bias.
Some of you are politically

424
28:05
right wing.
Some of you are politically

425
28:07
left wing.
If I asked you what magazines

426
28:10
you read, it turns out people
who are right wing read right

427
28:13
wing magazines,
people who are left wing read

428
28:16
left wing magazines,
because people don't as a rule

429
28:20
enjoy getting information that
disconfirms what they believe

430
28:25
in.
They want to have information

431
28:27
that confirms what they believe
in and that supports it.

432
28:30
If you support Bush you're
going to be looking for good

433
28:33
news about Bush,
if you don't support him you'll

434
28:36
be looking for bad news.
And this manifests itself in

435
28:41
all sorts of interesting ways.
I'll tell you about a very

436
28:47
simple experiment.
I'll--It was done by Louisa

437
28:50
Egan here at Yale and it
illustrates a point which is

438
28:54
going to--which--and then I'll
talk about real world

439
28:57
implications of this.
Very simple.

440
29:01
You have three M&Ms.
You pretest to make sure that

441
29:06
the person doesn't like any
M&M more than the other.

442
29:10
And there are three M&Ms.
Who cares?

443
29:12
But then you ask them to choose
between two of them.

444
29:15
So, suppose they choose the red
one.

445
29:19
You've got to choose one.
So, they get to eat the red one.

446
29:22
Now, they're offered--You take
the red one away and now they're

447
29:26
offered a choice between the two
remaining ones.

448
29:29
It turns out,
to a tremendous degree,

449
29:31
and you could imagine yourself
in that situation,

450
29:34
they choose this one,
the one that wasn't the one

451
29:39
they turned down.
And the claim is that when you

452
29:43
choose this, in order to justify
your decision,

453
29:47
you denigrate the one you
didn't choose.

454
29:50
And so this one you didn't
choose is then tainted and you

455
29:56
turn and then when compared to a
third one you favor that third

456
30:01
one.
What's particularly interesting

457
30:05
is you get this effect easily
with undergraduates but you also

458
30:09
get it with four-year-olds and
with monkeys.

459
30:13
So, the same denigration tends
to be more general.

460
30:17
Well, that's a laboratory
effect but there are some more

461
30:22
interesting manifestations of
cognitive dissonance.

462
30:27
One is the insufficient
justification effect,

463
30:31
which is so famous it had a
cartoon based on it.

464
30:34
The guys says,
"Why should I hire you as my

465
30:37
consultant?"
The dog--Some dog says,

466
30:40
"I use my special--the special
process of cognitive dissonance

467
30:44
to improve employee morale."
"How does it work?"

468
30:48
"Well, when people are in an
absurd situation their minds

469
30:52
rationalize it by inventing a
comfortable illusion."

470
30:55
Not quite right.
When people are--have an

471
30:57
internal conflict,
when there's something

472
30:59
uncomfortable--Well,
that's right.

473
31:01
So says to this person,
"Isn't it strange you have this

474
31:05
dead-end job when you're twice
as smart as your boss?

475
31:08
The hours are long,
the pay is mediocre,

476
31:10
nobody respects your
contribution,

477
31:12
yet you freely choose to work
here.

478
31:14
It's absurd.
No.

479
31:15
Wait.
There must be a reason.

480
31:17
I must work here because I love
this work, I love this job."

481
31:21
[laughter] This actually works.
Here is the classic experiment

482
31:26
by Festinger.
Gave two groups of people a

483
31:28
really boring task,
paid one of them twenty

484
31:31
dollars,
which back when this study was

485
31:34
done was real money,
gave another group of subjects

486
31:37
one dollar,
which was insultingly small,

487
31:40
then asked them later,
"What do you think of the

488
31:43
task?"
It turns out that the group

489
31:46
that had--were paid a dollar
rated the task as much more fun

490
31:51
than the group given twenty
dollars.

491
31:54
So, think about that for a
moment.

492
31:57
You might have predicted it the
other way around,

493
31:59
the twenty dollars,
"wow, well,

494
32:01
twenty dollars,
I must have enjoyed it because

495
32:03
I got twenty dollars," but in
fact,

496
32:04
the logic here is the people
with twenty dollars when asked,

497
32:07
"What do you think of the
task?"

498
32:09
could say, "It was boring.
I did it for twenty dollars."

499
32:15
The people paid one dollar were
like the character in the

500
32:18
Dilbert cartoon.
When paid a dollar they said,

501
32:23
"Well, I don't want to be a
donkey.

502
32:27
I don't want to be some guy who
does this boring thing for a

503
32:30
dollar.
It wasn't that bad really,

504
32:32
it was kind of interesting,
I learnt a lot," to justify

505
32:36
what they did.
This has a lot of real world

506
32:40
implications.
Festinger did a wonderful study

507
32:43
with people--a group of people,
and he wrote this up in a book

508
32:47
called When Prophesy Fails,
 who were convinced that

509
32:52
the world was going to end so
they went on a mountain and they

510
32:56
waited for the world to end.
They had a certain time and

511
33:00
date when the world was going to
end.

512
33:02


513
33:05
He hung out with them and then
the time passed and the world

514
33:09
didn't end.
What people then said,

515
33:12
and this is what he was
interested in--;So,

516
33:14
people's predictions were
totally proven wrong and they

517
33:18
left their families,
they gave away their houses,

518
33:21
they gave away all their
possessions, they lost all their

519
33:24
money,
but what Festinger found was

520
33:27
they didn't say,
"God, I'm such a moron."

521
33:31
Rather, they said,
"This is fantastic.

522
33:36
This is exactly--This shows
that us going to the mountain

523
33:39
has delayed the ending of the
world and this shows that we're

524
33:43
doing exactly the right things.
I couldn't have been smarter."

525
33:47
And in general,
when people devote a lot of

526
33:51
energy or money or expense to
something, they are

527
33:54
extraordinarily resistant to
having it proven wrong.

528
33:59
Now, people have manipulated
cognitive dissonance in all

529
34:04
sorts of ways and,
for instance,

530
34:07
hazing.
Hazing is cognitive dissonance

531
34:10
at work.
Fraternities and med schools

532
34:14
and other organizations haze
people.

533
34:18
What they do is when people
enter the group they humiliate

534
34:21
them, they cause them pain,
they cause them various forms

535
34:24
of torture and unpleasantness.
Why?

536
34:27
Well, because it's very
successful at getting somebody

537
34:32
to like the group.
If I join a fraternity--it is

538
34:36
also by the way illegal so –
but if I were to join a

539
34:40
fraternity and they say,
"Welcome to the fraternity,

540
34:44
Dr.
Bloom.

541
34:45
Here.
Have a mint," and then we have

542
34:48
a good time and everything.
I'm thinking "okay,

543
34:51
sounds like a fun idea."
But if I join a fraternity and

544
34:55
they pour cow poop on my head
and make me stand in the rain

545
35:00
for a month wearing pantyhose
while they throw rocks at me

546
35:04
[laughter]
I then think--after it I think

547
35:07
"God,
I went through a lot of stuff

548
35:10
to get into this fraternity.
It must be really good."

549
35:14
And in fact,
hazing through cognitive

550
35:17
dissonance draws the inference
that this is really,

551
35:21
really valuable and this is why
it exists.

552
35:25
If you are a political--If you
are running for office,

553
35:30
you will tend to have
volunteers and not necessarily

554
35:35
pay people.
One reason for this is obvious;

555
35:38
it's cheaper not to pay people,
but the other reason is more

556
35:41
interesting.
If you don't pay people,

557
35:44
they are more committed to the
cause.

558
35:47
Again, it's cognitive
dissonance.

559
35:49
If you pay me ten thousand
dollars a month to work for you,

560
35:52
I'll work for you and I'll
think "I'm doing it for ten

561
35:54
thousand dollars a month,
that makes a lot of sense," but

562
35:58
if I do it for nothing then I
have to ask myself,

563
36:01
"Why am I doing it?"
And I will conclude I must

564
36:05
think very highly of you.
Therapy for free tends to be

565
36:11
useless therapy.
This is one-- [laughs]

566
36:15
Therapists ask for money for
all sorts of reasons,

567
36:17
including they like money.
But one reason why they ask for

568
36:21
money is if you don't pay for
therapy you don't think it has

569
36:24
any value.
You have to give up something.

570
36:26
So, cognitive dissonance will
lead you then to think that what

571
36:30
you are giving it up for has
some value and then you

572
36:34
establish a liking for it.

573
36:36


574
36:39
Finally, cognitive dissonance
shows up with children.

575
36:44
One of the most robust and
replicated findings in education

576
36:49
or developmental psychology is
very simple.

577
36:53
You take two groups of kids and
you ask them to do something

578
36:57
like draw pictures.
Half of the kids you reward.

579
37:01
Maybe you give them a sticker
or a toy.

580
37:04
The other half you don't reward.
Now, according to sort of a

581
37:09
simple-minded view of operant
conditioning in behaviorist

582
37:13
psychology, the children you
reward should do it more.

583
37:17
That's how operative
conditioning works.

584
37:19
In fact though,
the children who you reward

585
37:22
later on think that this
activity has less value and they

586
37:26
are less likely to do it when
there's no reward present.

587
37:31
And the idea,
again, is the kids who don't

588
37:33
get rewarded say to themselves,
"Well,

589
37:35
I just spent time doing it,
it must have an intrinsic

590
37:38
value," while the children who
get rewarded say,

591
37:41
"I did it for the sticker.
I did it for the toy.

592
37:44
I don't care much for this."
And so, rewarding children has

593
37:48
a danger, which is if you give
them too much reward and too

594
37:52
much a value for what they're
doing they will denigrate the

595
37:56
activity.
Now, we need to be careful here

596
38:01
about what's going on.
It's not simple inconsistency.

597
38:06
So, go back to this
insufficient justification

598
38:09
effect.
So, the dollar group rated a

599
38:12
task as more fun than the twenty
dollar group.

600
38:15
And it's true;
each group needed a

601
38:17
justification for lying about
the task.

602
38:20
Each group needed a
justification for saying how

603
38:22
interesting the task was,
but they each had a

604
38:24
justification.
They were each doing it for

605
38:27
money after all.
So, cognitive dissonance is a

606
38:30
little bit more subtle.
It's not just that there's a

607
38:33
clash.
Rather, we adjust our beliefs

608
38:37
to make ourselves look more
moral and rational than we are.

609
38:42
Go back to hazing.
There's a perfectly good reason

610
38:46
why I let them do all those
things to me.

611
38:48
I'm the sort of person who will
let people do those things to

612
38:52
me.
The problem is that's not an

613
38:54
answer I could live with.
So, cognitive dissonance

614
38:58
motivates me to create an answer
that's more comfortable for me,

615
39:02
an answer such as "This must be
a really wonderful group with a

616
39:07
wonderful bunch of people."
And in other words,

617
39:11
we are biased to believe that
we are terrific.

618
39:15
So, to sum up,
there are three main findings

619
39:18
about you that come out in
social psychology.

620
39:22
One is you believe everybody
notices you even when they

621
39:27
don't.
You're the hero of your story.

622
39:31
The second one is,
you're terrific,

623
39:34
you are better than average in
every possible way,

624
39:37
each one of you.
And finally,

625
39:40
what you do makes sense.
If it doesn't make sense,

626
39:43
you'll--If it doesn't make
sense or, more to the point,

627
39:47
if it's something that you do
that's foolish or makes you look

628
39:51
manipulative or cheap,
you'll distort it in your head

629
39:57
so that it does make sense.
I want to move now to how we

630
40:02
think about self and other,
how we think about ourselves

631
40:06
relative to how we think about
other people.

632
40:09
And this brings us to the
notion of attribution.

633
40:14
So, an attribution is a claim
about the cause of somebody's

634
40:20
behavior and Heider--;Now,
there's all sorts of reasons

635
40:26
for somebody's behavior.
Suppose you insult me or

636
40:31
suppose you're very kind to me.
I could say you're a kind

637
40:35
person or you're a rude person.
I could say "this must be a

638
40:38
great day for you" or "you must
be a lot of--under a lot of

639
40:41
stress or you must want
something."

640
40:43
There's different sorts of
attributions we could make to

641
40:46
people but Heider's insight is
we tend to attribute other

642
40:50
people's actions to their
personality characteristics,

643
40:54
to long-standing aspects of
what they are.

644
41:01
And this is known as a person
bias.

645
41:04
And more generally,
people tend to give too much

646
41:07
weight to the person and not
enough weight to the situation.

647
41:11


648
41:15
This is also sometimes known as
the fundamental attribution

649
41:19
error.
The fundamental attribution

650
41:21
error, which is one of the core
ideas in psychology,

651
41:24
is that we tend to
over-attribute things to a

652
41:29
person's personality or desires
or nature and not enough to the

653
41:37
situation or the context.
There's a lot of demonstrations

654
41:43
of this.
A lot of the demonstrations

655
41:46
have to do with intelligence so,
for example,

656
41:49
there's actually been studies
showing that people tend to

657
41:53
overestimate the intelligence of
professors.

658
41:57
Why?
Because I stand up here and I

659
42:00
talk about the one or more than
one thing I know about and so

660
42:05
it's easy to infer that I must
know a lot but in fact by the

661
42:09
time this semester ends I will
have tell you--told you

662
42:13
everything I know.
[laughter]

663
42:16
And if you stood up and started
talking about everything you

664
42:19
knew you'd look really smart
too.

665
42:21
The best study to show this is
a quiz show study,

666
42:24
which is you take two people
and you flip a coin.

667
42:29
And one of them is the quiz
master and the quiz master gets

668
42:33
to ask questions,
any question he or she wants.

669
42:36
And the other person has to
answer the questions.

670
42:39
And if they play seriously,
the quiz master's going to

671
42:42
destroy the other person.
"What was my dog's name?"

672
42:46
[laughter] "Well, I don't know."
"What's the capital of the city

673
42:50
in which I was born?"
"Well, I don't know."

674
42:53
And then you'd expect a third
person watching this to say,

675
42:57
"Who cares?
It's just--They're just doing

676
42:59
this because of the coin they
flipped."

677
43:01
But in fact,
when the person watching this

678
43:04
has to assess their intelligence
they give the quiz asker a

679
43:07
higher intelligence rating than
the other person.

680
43:10
After all, "He seemed to know a
lot of answers.

681
43:12
The other person didn't get
much right."

682
43:15
We tend to fail to discount the
situation.

683
43:18
If you were giving a job
talk--and this is for people in

684
43:22
graduate school particularly--If
you were giving a job talk and

685
43:26
the slide projector breaks,
you're screwed.

686
43:29
Nobody is going to say to
themselves, "Oh,

687
43:31
well, it's not such a good talk
because the slide projector

688
43:35
broke."
They'll say,

689
43:36
"It's not such a good talk
because of the person."

690
43:40
Somebody could give a talk and
we could throw smarties at them

691
43:43
the whole time and then you
could--then the other people

692
43:45
would say,
"The person looked kind of

693
43:47
upset during the whole talk.
[laughter]

694
43:49
I wonder--They seemed like a
nervous type."

695
43:51
[laughter]
This can be taken to extremes

696
43:54
and the biggest extreme is the
case of actors,

697
43:58
which is if there's ever a
case--Anybody know who this is,

698
44:05
the actor?
[laughter]

699
44:08
Have none of you been alive in
1950?

700
44:12
[laughter] This is Robert Young.
Does anybody know the part he

701
44:18
plays?
He played an--He played a

702
44:20
doctor called Marcus Welby in
this famous show "Marcus Welby,

703
44:25
M.D.," and Marcus Welby was a
wonderful doctor.

704
44:29
He was compassionate and kind,
he made house calls,

705
44:32
he saved lives,
he counseled people,

706
44:34
and it turned out that Robert
Young was then deluged with

707
44:38
mail, thousands of pieces of
mail,

708
44:40
by people asking for his advice
on health matters.

709
44:45
[laughter]
And he then,

710
44:46
in a twist, exploited the
fundamental attribution

711
44:50
error--people confusing the
actor for the role--exploited

712
44:54
this by going on TV and
espousing the benefits of Sanka

713
44:59
decaffeinated coffee where he
produced the famous line "I am

714
45:03
not a doctor but I play one on
TV,"

715
45:07
[laughter]
whereupon people heard this and

716
45:09
said, "Well, he must have some
authority then about medical

717
45:11
matters."
[laughter]

718
45:13
It turns out that the confusion
between actors and their roles

719
45:19
is extremely common.
Many people,

720
45:22
for instance,
view Sylvester Stallone as

721
45:25
either an actual hero during the
Vietnam War or sort of a hero

722
45:30
during the Vietnam War given all
his Rambo stuff but in fact,

723
45:35
of course, he played--he was in
a Swiss boarding school teaching

724
45:40
girls age twelve through fifteen
during the Vietnam War.

725
45:44
But it doesn't seem that way
because the role infects how we

726
45:48
think about the person.
When this movie came out twenty

727
45:53
years ago they needed a
character to play a gay man.

728
45:57
According to IMDb,
where I get all my information,

729
46:00
they hit up all the big stars,
Harrison Ford,

730
46:03
Michael Douglas,
and Richard Gere,

731
46:05
and they all turned it down
because they didn't want to play

732
46:08
a gay man because people would
think that they were gay.

733
46:12
Finally, they got Harry Hamlin
to do it, who was kind of a

734
46:15
B-list sort of guy.
The biggest extreme of the

735
46:18
fundamental attribution error,
confusing the actor for his

736
46:22
role,
is Leonard Nimoy who,

737
46:24
because he played the
emotionless Vulcan,

738
46:27
Spock, on Star Trek,
was then repeatedly viewed by

739
46:31
people who saw him on the street
as if he was an actual Vulcan.

740
46:36
[laughter]
He got sufficiently upset about

741
46:39
this to write a book called I
Am Not Spock where he

742
46:43
described all the ways in which
he was not a Vulcan.

743
46:47
[laughter]
His career, where he attempted

744
46:50
many times to play roles that
were different from his Vulcan

745
46:55
nature,
stalled until finally many

746
46:58
years later he gave up and wrote
another book called I Am

747
47:03
Spock [laughter]
where he finally conceded to

748
47:06
the fundamental attribution
error.

749
47:10
[laughter]
If I gave this lecture ten

750
47:13
years ago, I would say that the
fundamental attribution error is

751
47:19
a human universal,
something that we're born with,

752
47:23
a fundamental aspect of human
nature.

753
47:26
This is not entirely true
though and we know that through

754
47:31
some very interesting
cross-cultural research that

755
47:35
compares these biases across
different countries,

756
47:41
in this study between the
United States and India.

757
47:44
And it turns out that for
whatever reason,

758
47:46
and it would take another
course to talk about the

759
47:49
different explanations,
but people start off at,

760
47:53
say, age eight not committing
the fundamental attribution

761
47:58
error but in Western cultures,
where there's an ideology

762
48:02
perhaps that people are in
charge of their own destiny,

763
48:06
the error occurs and people
over-attribute the role to the

764
48:11
person.
In some Eastern cultures

765
48:14
there's more of a view about
faith and more attributions to

766
48:18
situation.
And this has been shown in many

767
48:21
ways.
For instance,

768
48:22
if you look at newspaper
reports about murders,

769
48:25
in cultures like the United
States the report tends to

770
48:29
emphasize the personal
characteristics of the person

771
48:33
accused of the murder.
In countries like India,

772
48:37
the reports tend to emphasize,
to a greater degree,

773
48:40
the situation that the person
found himself in that might have

774
48:44
driven him to commit a murder.
So, this is an important

775
48:48
reminder that just because we
find something in our culture

776
48:52
and just because it might well
be pervasive doesn't mean

777
48:57
necessarily that it's universal.

778
49:00


779
49:04
So, to summarize so far,
and we're going to look at this

780
49:07
a little bit more for the rest
of this lecture,

781
49:10
we've talked about two morals
in social psychology.

782
49:14
One is enhancement of the self
but the other is what you can

783
49:19
call "oversimplification of the
other."

784
49:22
So, we know ourselves that our
behavior is due to a complicated

785
49:27
cluster of the situation and our
personal natures.

786
49:31
When things go badly,
in fact, we'll blame the

787
49:35
situation.
When things go well,

788
49:37
the self-serving attribution
bias, we'll credit ourselves.

789
49:42
We don't do this for other
people.

790
49:44
For other people we're a lot
less forgiving.

791
49:47
You do something stupid,
that's--you're a stupid person.

792
49:51
I do something stupid,
it's an off day.

793
49:55
And so, you have this
difference between how we think

794
49:59
about ourselves and how we think
about other people.

795
50:03
Let's talk a little bit about
what we think about other people

796
50:08
and start by talking about why
we like other people.

797
50:12
And here I'm going to some
extent to go over material that

798
50:15
was raised earlier in the course
in Peter Salovey's wonderful

799
50:20
lecture.
So, some of this,

800
50:21
our liking of other people,
is obvious and we talked about

801
50:25
it in Dean Salovey's lecture,
we talked about it when we

802
50:28
talked about sexual
attractiveness.

803
50:30
We like people who are honest,
who are kind,

804
50:34
who are smart,
who are funny,

805
50:36
but study after study finds
more fundamental processes are

806
50:41
also at work and here is a list
of three of them.

807
50:45
One is proximity.
We tend to like people who

808
50:50
we're close to physically,
who we are physically and

809
50:55
spatially close to,
who we spend a lot of time

810
50:59
with.
In one study they looked at a

811
51:02
housing project in Manhattan and
they asked people where their

812
51:09
best friend was and 90% of them
said,

813
51:13
"My best friend is in the same
building as me," and 50% of them

814
51:17
says the same floor.
Ask yourself who is your best

815
51:20
friend at Yale.
For how many of you is it

816
51:23
somebody in your same college?
Okay.

817
51:27
How many in a different college?
So, call it a tie but then

818
51:31
there's a lot more colleges that
aren't yours than the one--How

819
51:35
many of you would you--say your
best friend is somebody

820
51:39
your--currently on your same
floor?

821
51:41
Yeah.
If you were going to marry

822
51:45
somebody from this class,
it is the person you are

823
51:49
sitting next to?
[laughter]

824
51:53
Now, in some sense this is
an--a rather trivial finding.

825
52:04
Of course you're going to get
more involved in people you

826
52:07
encounter frequently.
How else is it going to work?

827
52:11
But it's actually more than
that.

828
52:13
The more you see something the
more you like it and this is

829
52:17
sometimes known as "the mere
exposure effect."

830
52:21
The mere exposure effect is
simply seeing something makes it

831
52:26
likable perhaps because it
becomes comfortable and safe.

832
52:31
In one study by James Cutting,
Cutting taught an Introduction

833
52:35
to Psychology course and before
each lecture he'd flash pictures

834
52:39
on the screen.
He'd have a screen saver

835
52:42
showing pictures on the screen,
paintings, and didn't say

836
52:45
anything about them.
People would sit down,

837
52:47
look at them while they
prepared their notes.

838
52:49
At the end of the semester he
then asked people to rate

839
52:53
different pictures as to how
much they liked them,

840
52:56
and even though people had no
memory of seeing one or--versus

841
53:01
the other they tend to like the
pictures more that they had seen

842
53:06
before.
They were somehow familiar and

843
53:09
somehow more likable.
If I showed you a picture of

844
53:13
yourself versus a mirror image
of yourself and asked which one

845
53:19
you'd like more,
the answer is very strong.

846
53:23
You'd like your mirror image
more because the mirror image is

847
53:26
what you tend to see from day to
day.

848
53:29
If I showed your best friend a
picture of you versus a mirror

849
53:33
image picture of you,
your best friend would say he

850
53:36
or she likes the picture more
because that corresponds to what

851
53:40
he or she sees each day.
Familiarity is itself a desire

852
53:45
for liking, a force for liking.

853
53:49


854
53:52
Similarity--we like people who
are similar to us.

855
53:56
Friends tend to be highly
similar to one another.

856
54:01
So do husbands and wives.
Now, to some extent,

857
54:04
similarity is hard to pull
apart from proximity.

858
54:08
So, the fact that you are
similar to your friends at Yale

859
54:11
might just be because you are
close to your friends at Yale

860
54:15
and people who are at Yale tend
to be fairly similar to one

861
54:18
another.
But there's a lot of evidence

862
54:21
that similarity,
above and beyond proximity,

863
54:24
has an effect on attractiveness
and on liking.

864
54:28
Similarity predicts the success
of a marriage and through a

865
54:32
phenomena people aren't exactly
sure about,

866
54:35
couples become more and more
similar over the course of a

867
54:39
relationship.
Finally, people like

868
54:42
good-looking people.
People like attractive people.

869
54:47


870
54:50
Physically attractive people
are thought to be smarter,

871
54:54
more competent,
more social and nicer.

872
54:57
Now, some of you who are very
cynical and/or very good looking

873
55:02
might wonder "yes,
but good-looking people like me

874
55:06
actually are smarter,
more competent,

875
55:09
more social and morally
better."

876
55:12
This is not a crazy response.
It is--it could be,

877
55:17
for instance,
that the advantages of being

878
55:20
good looking make your life run
a lot easier.

879
55:23
Teachers are more responsive to
you, people treat you better,

880
55:27
you have more opportunities to
make your way through the world,

881
55:30
you make more money,
you have more access to things,

882
55:33
and that could,
in turn,

883
55:34
cause you to improve your life.
This would be what's known in

884
55:39
the Bible as a "Matthew effect."
A Matthew effect is a

885
55:43
developmental psychology phrase
for the sort of thing where,

886
55:46
well, as Jesus said,
"For unto everyone that hath

887
55:50
shall be given and he shall have
abundance."

888
55:54
That means if you're good
looking you'll also be smart but

889
55:58
from him that hath not shall be
taken away even that which he

890
56:03
hath.
It's a long version of the rich

891
56:07
get richer and the poor even
lose what they hath.

892
56:12
So, there's a variety of
studies suggesting that teachers

893
56:16
rate attractive children as
smarter and higher achieving.

894
56:19
Adults think that when an ugly
kid misbehaves it's because they

895
56:24
have an ugly soul [laughter]
while the attractive kid,

896
56:29
"oh, that little scamp,
somebody must have been

897
56:32
bothering him."
When I was in the University of

898
56:35
Arizona and we lived next--and
all I remember of my

899
56:39
neighborhood is we lived next to
this little boy and his name was

900
56:44
Adonis.
[laughter]

901
56:46
Cute kid, but come on.
[laughter]

902
56:48
Also in mock trials judges give
longer prison sentences to ugly

903
56:52
people.
[laughter]

904
56:54
That's the Matthew effect,
those who hath little get even

905
56:57
that taken away and thrown into
prison.

906
57:00
There is a recent study,
which I'll tell you about but I

907
57:04
am not comfortable with it as an
experiment.

908
57:08
The study observed people in a
shopping--in a parking lot of a

909
57:14
supermarket and found that
parents were a lot rougher to

910
57:19
the kids if their kids are ugly
than if their kids are good

911
57:24
looking.
And they attribute it to the

912
57:27
fact that, for all sorts of
reasons, the ugly kid just

913
57:29
matters less to the parent.
I was watching a poker game

914
57:33
once on TV and somebody who lost
said, and I quote,

915
57:38
"They beat me like an ugly
stepchild" [laughter]

916
57:40
and the fate of the ugly
stepchild is,

917
57:43
in fact, not a very good fate
but this is not a good study.

918
57:47
For one thing,
and I don't know how to phrase

919
57:50
this in a politically correct
way,

920
57:52
but the parents of ugly kids
are likely to themselves be ugly

921
57:57
people [laughter]
and maybe what they're finding

922
58:00
is just ugly people are more
violent than good-looking

923
58:04
people.
[laughter]

924
58:06
This is an excellent time to
stop the lecture [laughter]

925
58:09
so I'm going to stop the
lecture and we're going to

926
58:12
continue social psychology on
Wednesday.
