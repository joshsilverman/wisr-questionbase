Professor Paul Bloom:
Okay.

2
0:12
The last class we talked about
the brain.

3
0:15
Now we're going to talk a
little bit about some

4
0:17
foundations.
So today and Monday we're going

5
0:21
to talk about two very big ideas
and these ideas are associated

6
0:27
with Sigmund Freud and B.
F.

7
0:30
Skinner and are psychoanalysis
and behaviorism.

8
0:35
And I want to talk about
psychoanalysis today and

9
0:38
behaviorism next week.
Now, one of these things--One

10
0:42
of the things that makes these
theories so interesting is their

11
0:46
scope.
Most of the work we're going to

12
0:49
talk about in this class--Most
of the ideas are narrow.

13
0:52
So, we're going to talk about
somebody's idea about racial

14
0:56
prejudice but that's not a
theory of language acquisition.

15
1:00
We'll talk about theories of
schizophrenia but they're not

16
1:04
explanations of sexual
attractiveness.

17
1:08
Most theories are specialized
theories but these two views are

18
1:12
grand theories.
They're theories of everything,

19
1:15
encompassing just about
everything that matters,

20
1:18
day-to-day life,
child development,

21
1:20
mental illness,
religion, war,

22
1:22
love.
Freud and Skinner had

23
1:24
explanations of all of these.
Now, this is not a history

24
1:28
course.
I have zero interest in

25
1:30
describing historical figures in
psychology just for the sake of

26
1:34
telling you about the history of
the field.

27
1:36
What I want to tell you about
though is--I want to talk about

28
1:40
these ideas because so much
rests on them and,

29
1:44
even more importantly,
a lot of these ideas have

30
1:47
critical influence on how we
think about the present.

31
1:51


32
1:55
And that's there.
Now, for better or worse,

33
1:58
we live in a world profoundly
affected by Sigmund Freud.

34
2:03
If I had to ask you to choose
a--no, name a famous

35
2:06
psychologist,
the answer of most of you would

36
2:10
be Freud.
He's the most famous

37
2:12
psychologist ever and he's had a
profound influence on the

38
2:16
twentieth and twenty-first
century.

39
2:19
Some biographical information:
He was born in the 1850s.

40
2:23
He spent most of his life in
Vienna, Austria,

41
2:26
but he died in London and he
escaped to London soon after

42
2:31
retreating there at the
beginning of World War II as the

43
2:35
Nazis began to occupy where he
lived.

44
2:39
He's one of the most famous
scholars ever but he's not known

45
2:43
for any single discovery.
Instead, he's known for the

46
2:47
development of an encompassing
theory of mind,

47
2:50
one that he developed over the
span of many decades.

48
2:54
He was in his time extremely
well known, a celebrity

49
2:57
recognized on the street,
and throughout his life.

50
3:01
He was a man of extraordinary
energy and productivity,

51
3:04
in part because he was a very
serious cocaine addict,

52
3:07
but also just in general.
He was just a high-energy sort

53
3:11
of person.
He was up for the Nobel Prize

54
3:13
in medicine and in literature;
didn't get either one of them;

55
3:17
didn't get the prize in
medicine because Albert

56
3:20
Einstein--Everybody loves Albert
Einstein.

57
3:23
Well, Albert Einstein really
wrote a letter because they

58
3:25
asked for opinions of other
Nobel Prizes.

59
3:28
He wrote a letter saying,
"Don't give the prize to Freud.

60
3:30
He doesn't deserve a Nobel
Prize.

61
3:32
He's just a psychologist."
Well, yeah.

62
3:38
Okay.
While he's almost universally

63
3:41
acclaimed as a profoundly
important intellectual figure,

64
3:45
he's also the object of
considerable dislike.

65
3:49
This is in part because of his
character.

66
3:51
He was not a very nice man in
many ways.

67
3:53
He was deeply ambitious to the
cause of promoting

68
3:57
psychoanalysis,
to the cause of presenting his

69
4:00
view and defending it,
and he was often dishonest,

70
4:04
extremely brutal to his
friends, and terrible to his

71
4:08
enemies.
He was an interesting character.

72
4:11
My favorite Freud story was as
he was leaving Europe during the

73
4:15
rise of the Nazis,
as he was ready to go to

74
4:19
England from,
I think, either Germany or

75
4:22
Austria, he had to sign a letter
from the Gestapo.

76
4:26
Gestapo agents intercepted him
and demanded he sign a letter

77
4:30
saying that at no point had he
been threatened or harassed by

78
4:34
the Gestapo.
So he signs the letter and then

79
4:38
he writes underneath it,
"The Gestapo has not harmed me

80
4:41
in any way.
In fact, I highly recommend the

81
4:44
Gestapo to everybody."
It's--He had a certain

82
4:48
aggression to him.
He was also--He's also

83
4:52
disliked, often hated,
because of his views.

84
4:56
He was seen as a sexual
renegade out to destroy the

85
5:00
conception of people as good and
rational and pure beings.

86
5:04
And when the Nazis rose to
power in the 1930s he was

87
5:08
identified as a Jew who was
devoted to destroying the most

88
5:11
sacred notions of Christianity
and to many,

89
5:15
to some extent,
many people see him this way.

90
5:19
And to some extent,
this accusation has some truth

91
5:23
to it.
Freud made claims about people

92
5:26
that many of us,
maybe most of us,

93
5:29
would rather not know.
Well, okay.

94
5:32
What did he say?
Well, if you ask somebody who

95
5:35
doesn't like Freud what he said,
they'll describe some of the

96
5:39
stupider things he said and,
in fact, Freud said a lot of

97
5:43
things, some of which were not
very rational.

98
5:46
For instance,
he's well known for his account

99
5:50
of phallic symbols,
arguing certain architectural

100
5:54
monuments are subconsciously
developed as penile

101
5:58
representations.
And related to this,

102
6:01
he developed the notorious
theory of penis envy.

103
6:04
And penis envy is an account of
a developmental state that every

104
6:08
one of you who is female has
gone through,

105
6:11
according to Freud.
And the idea is that you

106
6:13
discovered at some point in your
development that you lacked a

107
6:17
penis.
This is not--This is a

108
6:20
catastrophe.
And so, each of you inferred at

109
6:23
that point that you had been
castrated.

110
6:26
You had once had a penis but
somebody had taken it from you.

111
6:32
You then turn to your father
and love your father because

112
6:36
your father has a penis,
so he's a sort of penis

113
6:40
substitute.
You reject your mother,

114
6:43
who's equally unworthy due to
her penis lack,

115
6:47
and that shapes your
psychosexual development.

116
6:52
Now, if that's the sort of
thing you know about Freud,

117
6:55
you are not going to have a
very high opinion of him or of

118
6:57
his work,
but at the core of Freud's

119
7:00
declamation, the more
interesting ideas,

120
7:04
is a set of claims of a man's
intellectual importance.

121
7:09
And the two main ones are this.
The two main ones involve the

122
7:12
existence of an unconscious,
unconscious motivation,

123
7:16
and the notion of unconscious
dynamics or unconscious conflict

124
7:20
which lead to mental illnesses,
dreams, slips of the tongue and

125
7:25
so on.
The first idea – the idea of

126
7:28
unconscious motivation –
involves rejecting the claim

127
7:33
that you know what you're doing.
So, suppose you fall in love

128
7:37
with somebody and you decide you
want to marry them and then

129
7:41
somebody was asked to ask you
why and you'd say something

130
7:44
like,
"Well, I'm ready to get married

131
7:46
this stage of my life;
I really love the person;

132
7:49
the person is smart and
attractive;

133
7:50
I want to have kids" whatever.
And maybe this is true.

134
7:56
But a Freudian might say that
even if this is your honest

135
8:00
answer – you're not lying to
anybody else –still,

136
8:04
there are desires and
motivations that govern your

137
8:08
behavior that you may not be
aware of.

138
8:11
So, in fact,
you might want to marry John

139
8:14
because he reminds you of your
father or because you want to

140
8:19
get back at somebody for
betraying you.

141
8:23
If somebody was to tell you
this, you'd say,

142
8:25
"That's total nonsense," but
that wouldn't deter a Freudian.

143
8:29
The Freudian would say that
these processes are unconscious

144
8:32
so of course you just don't know
what's happening.

145
8:34
So, the radical idea here is
you might not know what--why you

146
8:39
do what you do and this is
something we accept for things

147
8:44
like visual perception.
We accept that you look around

148
8:47
the world and you get sensations
and you figure out there is a

149
8:50
car, there is a tree,
there is a person.

150
8:52
And you're just unconscious of
how this happens but it's

151
8:55
unpleasant and kind of
frightening that this could

152
8:58
happen,
that this could apply to things

153
9:01
like why you're now studying at
Yale, why you feel the way you

154
9:06
do towards your friends,
towards your family.

155
9:10
Now, the marriage case is
extreme but Freud gives a lot of

156
9:14
simpler examples where this sort
of unconscious motivation might

157
9:18
play a role.
So, have you ever liked

158
9:21
somebody or disliked them and
not known why?

159
9:24
Have you ever found yourself in
a situation where you're doing

160
9:27
something or you're arguing for
something or making a decision

161
9:31
for reasons that you can't fully
articulate?

162
9:34
Have you ever forgotten
somebody's name at exactly the

163
9:37
wrong time?
Have you ever called out the

164
9:39
wrong name in the throes of
passion?

165
9:41
This is all the Freudian
unconscious.

166
9:45
The idea is that we do these
things--these things are

167
9:48
explained in terms of cognitive
systems that we're not aware of.

168
9:51
Now, all of this would be fine
if your unconscious was a

169
9:55
reasonable, rational computer,
if your unconscious was really

170
9:59
smart and looking out for your
best interest.

171
10:02
But, according to Freud,
that's not the way it works.

172
10:05
According to Freud,
there are three distinct

173
10:08
processes going on in your head
and these are in violent

174
10:12
internal conflict.
And the way you act and the way

175
10:15
you think are products,
not of a singular rational

176
10:19
being, but of a set of
conflicting creatures.

177
10:22
And these three parts are the
id, the ego, and the superego

178
10:28
and they emerge developmentally.
The id, according to Freud,

179
10:33
is present at birth.
It's the animal part of the

180
10:37
self.
It wants to eat,

181
10:39
drink, pee, poop,
get warm, and have sexual

182
10:42
satisfaction.
It is outrageously stupid.

183
10:47
It works on what Freud called,
"The Pleasure Principle."

184
10:50
It wants pleasure and it wants
it now.

185
10:53
And that's, according to Freud,
how a human begins – pure id.

186
10:58
Freud had this wonderful
phrase, "polymorphous

187
11:02
perversity," this pure desire
for pleasure.

188
11:06
Now, unfortunately,
life doesn't work like that.

189
11:08
What you want isn't always what
you get and this leads to a set

190
11:13
of reactions to cope with the
fact that pleasure isn't always

191
11:17
there when you want it either by
planning how to satisfy your

192
11:22
desires or planning how to
suppress them.

193
11:25
And this system is known as the
ego, or the self.

194
11:29
And it works on the "Reality
Principle."

195
11:33
And it works on the principle
of trying to figure out how to

196
11:37
make your way through the world,
how to satisfy your pleasures

197
11:42
or, in some cases,
how to give up on them.

198
11:45
And the ego – the emergence
of the ego for Freud--symbolizes

199
11:49
the origin of consciousness.
Finally, if this was all there

200
11:53
it might be a simpler world,
but Freud had a third

201
11:57
component, that of the superego.
And the superego is the

202
12:01
internalized rules of parents in
society.

203
12:05
So, what happens in the course
of development is,

204
12:07
you're just trying to make your
way through the world and

205
12:09
satisfy your desires,
but sometimes you're punished

206
12:13
for them.
Some desires are inappropriate,

207
12:15
some actions are wrong,
and you're punished for it.

208
12:19
The idea is that you come out;
you get in your head a

209
12:23
superego, a conscience.
In these movies,

210
12:26
there'd be a little angel above
your head that tells you when

211
12:31
things are wrong.
And basically your self,

212
12:34
the ego, is in between the id
and the superego.

213
12:39
One thing to realize,
I told you the id is

214
12:42
outrageously stupid.
It just says,

215
12:44
"Oh, hungry,
food, sex, oh,

216
12:46
let's get warm,
oh."

217
12:48
The superego is also stupid.
The superego,

218
12:52
point to point,
is not some brilliant moral

219
12:55
philosopher telling you about
right and wrong.

220
12:57
The superego would say,
"You should be ashamed of

221
12:59
yourself.
That's disgusting.

222
13:01
Stop doing that.
Oh."

223
13:03
And in between these two
screaming creatures,

224
13:06
one of you;
one of them telling you to seek

225
13:09
out your desires,
the other one telling you,

226
13:11
"you should be ashamed of
yourself," is you,

227
13:14
is the ego.
Now, according to Freud,

228
13:16
most of this is unconscious.
So, we see bubbling up to the

229
13:21
top, we feel,
we experience ourselves.

230
13:25
And the driving of the id,
the forces of the id and the

231
13:28
forces of the superego,
are unconscious in that we

232
13:32
cannot access them.
We don't know what--It's like

233
13:36
the workings of our kidneys or
our stomachs.

234
13:39
You can't introspect and find
them.

235
13:42
Rather, they do their work
without conscious knowledge.

236
13:47
Now, Freud developed this.
This is the Freudian theory in

237
13:51
broad outline.
He extended it and developed it

238
13:54
into a theory of psychosexual
development.

239
13:58
And so, Freud's theory is,
as I said before,

240
14:01
a theory of everyday life,
of decisions,

241
14:04
of errors, of falling in love,
but it's also a theory of child

242
14:08
development.
So, Freud believed there were

243
14:11
five stages of personality
development, and each is

244
14:16
associated with a particular
erogenous zone.

245
14:19
And Freud believed,
as well, that if you have a

246
14:23
problem at a certain stage,
if something goes wrong,

247
14:26
you'll be stuck there.
So, according to Freud,

248
14:29
there are people in this room
who are what they are because

249
14:32
they got stuck in the oral stage
or the anal stage.

250
14:34
And that's not good.
So, the oral stage is when you

251
14:40
start off.
The mouth is associated with

252
14:42
pleasure.
Everything is sucking and

253
14:45
chewing and so on.
And the problem for Freud is

254
14:49
premature weaning of a child.
Depriving him of the breast,

255
14:53
could lead to serious problems
in his personality development.

256
14:58
It could make him,
as the phrase goes,

257
15:01
into an oral person.
And his orality could be

258
15:05
described literally.
Freud uses it as an explanation

259
15:10
for why somebody might eat too
much or chew gum or smoke.

260
15:14
They're trying to achieve
satisfaction through their mouth

261
15:17
of a sort they didn't get in
this very early stage of

262
15:21
development.
But it can also be more

263
15:23
abstract.
If your roommate is dependent

264
15:26
and needy, you could then go to
your roommate and say,

265
15:30
"You are an oral person.
The first year of your life did

266
15:35
not go well."
A phrase even more popular is

267
15:38
the anal stage and that happens
after the oral stage.

268
15:42
And problems can emerge if
toilet training is not handled

269
15:48
correctly.
If you have problems during

270
15:50
those years of life,
you could become an anal

271
15:53
personality,
according to Freud,

272
15:55
and your roommate could say,
"Your problem is you're too

273
15:59
anal."
And, according to Freud,

274
16:01
literally, it meant you are
unwilling to part with your own

275
16:04
feces.

276
16:05


277
16:08
It's written down here.
I know it's true.

278
16:10
And the way it manifests
itself, as you know from just

279
16:14
how people talk,
is you're compulsive,

280
16:16
you're clean,
you're stingy.

281
16:18
This is the anal personality.
Then it gets a little bit more

282
16:22
complicated.
The next stage is the phallic

283
16:25
stage.
Actually, this is not much more

284
16:27
complicated.
The focus of pleasure shifts to

285
16:30
the genitals and fixation can
lead to excessive masculinity in

286
16:36
females or in males or if you're
female a need for attention or

287
16:43
domination.
Now, at this point something

288
16:46
really interesting happens
called the "Oedipus Complex."

289
16:50
And this is based on the story,
the mythical story of a king

290
16:55
who killed his father and
married his mother.

291
16:58
And, according to Freud,
this happens to all of us in

292
17:03
this way.
Well, all of us.

293
17:05
By "all of us," Freud meant
"men."

294
17:09
So, here's the idea.
You're three or four years old.

295
17:13
You're in the phallic stage.
So, what are you interested in?

296
17:17
Well, you're interested in your
penis and then you seek an

297
17:21
external object.
Freud's sort of vague about

298
17:24
this, but you seek some sort of
satisfaction.

299
17:27
But who is out there who'd be
sweet and kind and loving and

300
17:30
wonderful?
Well, Mom.

301
17:35
So the child infers,
"Mom is nice,

302
17:39
I love Mom."
So far so--And so this is not

303
17:43
crazy;
a little boy falling in love

304
17:46
with his mother.
Problem: Dad's in the way.

305
17:51
Now, this is going to get
progressively weirder but I will

306
17:55
have to say, as the father of
two sons,

307
17:58
both sons went through a phase
where they explicitly said they

308
18:02
wanted to marry Mommy.
And me – if something bad

309
18:04
happened to me that wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world.

310
18:07
So, there's this.
But now it gets a little bit

311
18:13
aggressive.
So, the idea is the child

312
18:16
determines that he's going to
kill his father.

313
18:19
Every three- and four-year-old
boy thinks this.

314
18:22
But then because children,
according to Freud,

315
18:25
don't have a good sense of the
boundary between their mind and

316
18:30
the world,
which is a problem – the

317
18:32
problem is they don't – they
think their father can tell that

318
18:37
they're plotting to kill him and
they figure their father is now

319
18:41
angry at them.
And then they ask themselves,

320
18:44
"What's the worst thing Dad
could do to me?"

321
18:46
And the answer is castration.
So, they come to the conclusion

322
18:53
that their father is going to
castrate them because of their

323
18:57
illicit love for their Mom.
And then they say,

324
19:00
"Dad wins" and then they don't
think about sex for several

325
19:04
years and that's the latency
stage.

326
19:07
The latency stage is they've
gone through this huge thing

327
19:10
with Mom and Dad,
"fell in love with Mom,

328
19:12
wanted to kill my father,
Dad was going to castrate me,

329
19:16
fell out of love with Mom,
out of the sex business."

330
19:20
And then, sex is repressed
until you get to the genital

331
19:23
stage.
And the genital stage is the

332
19:25
stage we are all in – the
healthy adult stage.

333
19:30
Now that you're adults and
you've gone through all the

334
19:34
developmental stages,
where do you stand?

335
19:37
You're not out of the woods yet
because unconscious mechanisms

336
19:42
are still--Even if you haven't
got fixated on anything,

337
19:46
there's still this dynamic
going on all the time with your

338
19:50
id, your ego and your superego.
And the idea is your

339
19:54
superego--Remember,
your superego is stupid.

340
19:58
So, your superego isn't only
telling you not to do bad

341
20:02
things, it's telling you not to
think bad things.

342
20:07
So, what's happening is your id
is sending up all of this weird,

343
20:11
sick stuff, all of these crazy
sexual and violent desires,

344
20:15
"Oh, I'll kill him.
I'll have sex with that.

345
20:18
I'll have extra helpings on my
dessert."

346
20:23
And your superego is saying,
"No, no, no."

347
20:28
And this stuff is repressed.
It doesn't even make it to

348
20:31
consciousness.
The problem is Freud had a very

349
20:34
sort of hydraulic theory of what
goes on and some of this stuff

350
20:39
slips out and it shows up in
dreams and it shows up in slips

351
20:43
of the tongue.
And in exceptional cases,

352
20:46
it shows up in certain clinical
symptoms.

353
20:49
So what happens is,
Freud described a lot of normal

354
20:53
life in terms of different ways
we use to keep that horrible

355
20:58
stuff from the id making its way
to consciousness.

356
21:02
And he called these "defense
mechanisms."

357
21:05
You're defending yourself
against the horrible parts of

358
21:10
yourself and some of these make
a little bit of sense.

359
21:14
One way to describe this in a
non-technical,

360
21:17
non-Freudian way is,
there are certain things about

361
21:20
ourselves we'd rather not know.
There are certain desires we'd

362
21:23
rather not know and we have ways
to hide them.

363
21:26
So, for instance,
there's sublimation.

364
21:28
Sublimation is you might have a
lot of energy,

365
21:31
maybe sexual energy or
aggressive energy,

366
21:34
but instead of turning it to a
sexual or aggressive target what

367
21:38
you do is you focus it in some
other way.

368
21:40
So, you can imagine a great
artist like Picasso turning the

369
21:44
sexual energy into his artwork.
There is displacement.

370
21:52
Displacement is you have
certain shameful thoughts or

371
21:55
desires and you refocus them
more appropriately.

372
21:59
A boy who's bullied by his
father may hate his father and

373
22:03
want to hurt him but since this
would--this is very shameful and

374
22:08
difficult.
The boy might instead kick the

375
22:10
dog and think he hates the dog
because that's a more acceptable

376
22:14
target.

377
22:15


378
22:22
There is projection.
Projection is,

379
22:25
I have certain impulses I am
uncomfortable with,

380
22:28
so rather than own them myself,
I project them to somebody

381
22:33
else.
A classic example for Freud is

382
22:36
homosexual desires.
The idea is that I feel this

383
22:39
tremendous lust towards you,
for instance,

384
22:42
and--any of you,
all of you, you three,

385
22:46
and I'm ashamed of this lust so
what I say is,

386
22:50
"Hey.
Are you guys looking at me in a

387
22:53
sexual manner?
Are you lusting after me?

388
22:55
How disgusting," because what I
do is I take my own desires and

389
22:59
I project it to others.
And Freud suggested,

390
23:01
perhaps not implausibly,
that men who believe other

391
23:05
men--who are obsessed with the
sexuality of other men,

392
23:08
are themselves projecting away
their own sexual desires.

393
23:12
There is rationalization,
which is that when you do

394
23:16
something or think something bad
you rationalize it and you give

395
23:20
it a more socially acceptable
explanation.

396
23:24
A parent who enjoys smacking
his child will typically not

397
23:28
say, "I enjoy smacking my
child."

398
23:31
Rather he'll say,
"It's for the child's own good.

399
23:33
I'm being a good parent by
doing this."

400
23:35
And finally,
there is regression,

401
23:37
which is returning to an
earlier stage of development.

402
23:41
And you actually see this in
children.

403
23:42
In times of stress and trauma,
they'll become younger,

404
23:47
they will act younger.
They might cry.

405
23:50
They might suck their thumb,
seek out a blanket or so on.

406
23:53
Now, these are all mechanisms
that for Freud are not the

407
23:56
slightest bit pathological.
They are part of normal life.

408
24:00
Normally, we do these things to
keep an equilibrium among the

409
24:05
different systems of the
unconscious, but sometimes it

410
24:09
doesn't work.
Sometimes things go awry and

411
24:13
what happens is a phrase that's
not currently used in psychology

412
24:18
but was popular during Freud's
time: hysteria.

413
24:23
Hysteria includes phenomena
like hysterical blindness and

414
24:27
hysterical deafness,
which is when you cannot see

415
24:29
and cannot hear even though
there's nothing physiologically

416
24:32
wrong with you – paralysis,
trembling, panic attacks,

417
24:36
gaps of memory including
amnesia and so on.

418
24:39
And the idea is that these are
actually symptoms.

419
24:43
These are symptoms of
mechanisms going on to keep

420
24:46
things unconscious.
It's a common enough idea in

421
24:51
movies.
Often in movies what happens is

422
24:53
that somebody goes to an
analyst.

423
24:55
They have some horrible problem.
They can't remember something

424
24:58
or they have some sort of
blackouts and so on.

425
25:00
And the analyst tells them
something and at one point they

426
25:05
get this insight and they
realize what--why they've

427
25:09
blinded themselves,
why they can't remember,

428
25:12
and for Freud this is what
happens.

429
25:14
Freud originally attempted to
get these memories out through

430
25:20
hypnosis but then moved to the
mechanism of free association

431
25:25
and,
according to Freud,

432
25:27
the idea is patients offer
resistance to this and then the

433
25:33
idea of a psychoanalyst is to
get over the resistance and help

434
25:38
patients get insight.
The key notion of

435
25:43
psychoanalysis is your problems
are--actually reflect deeper

436
25:50
phenomena.
You're hiding something from

437
25:53
yourself, and once you know
what's going on to deeper

438
25:57
phenomena your problems will go
away.

439
25:59
I'm going to give you an
example of a therapy session.

440
26:03
Now, this is not a Freudian
analysis.

441
26:06
We'll discuss later on in the
course what a Freudian analysis

442
26:09
is, but this is not a pure
Freudian analysis.

443
26:11
A Freudian analysis,
of course, is lying on a couch;

444
26:14
does not see their therapist;
their therapist is very

445
26:17
nondirective.
But I'm going to present this

446
26:20
as an example here because it
illustrates so many of the

447
26:24
Freudian themes,
particularly themes about

448
26:27
dreams, the importance of
dreams, about repression and

449
26:30
about hidden meaning.
So, this is from a television

450
26:34
episode and the
character's--Many--Some of you

451
26:37
may have seen this.
Many of you will not have.

452
26:40
The character is suffering from
panic attacks.

453
26:42


454
27:14
Freud's contributions extend
beyond the study of individual

455
27:19
psychology and individual
pathology.

456
27:22
Freud had a lot to say about
dreams as you could see in this

457
27:26
illustration.
He believed that dreams had a

458
27:29
manifest content,
meaning;

459
27:32
"manifest" meaning what you
experience in your dream.

460
27:35
But dreams always had a latent
content as well,

461
27:38
meaning the hidden implication
of the dream.

462
27:42
He viewed all dreams as wish
fulfillment.

463
27:45
Every dream you have is a
certain wish you have even

464
27:47
though it might be a forbidden
wish that you wouldn't wish to

465
27:50
have, you wouldn't want to have.
And dreams had--and this is an

466
27:53
idea that long predated Freud.
Dreams had symbolism.

467
27:57
Things in dreams were often not
what they seemed to be but

468
28:02
rather symbols for other things.
Freud believed that literature

469
28:07
and fairy tales and stories to
children and the like carried

470
28:13
certain universal themes,
certain aspects of unconscious

471
28:18
struggles, and certain
preoccupations of our

472
28:22
unconscious mind.
And Freud had a lot to say

473
28:25
about religion.
For instance,

474
28:27
he viewed a large part of
our--of the idea of finding a

475
28:32
singular,
all-powerful god as seeking out

476
28:36
a father figure that some of us
never had during development.

477
28:41
What I want to spend the rest
of the class on is the

478
28:45
scientific assessment of Freud.
So, what I did so far is I've

479
28:48
told you what Freud had to say
in broad outline.

480
28:51
I then want to take the time to
consider whether or not we

481
28:55
should believe this and how well
it fits with our modern science.

482
28:59
But before doing so,
I'll take questions for a few

483
29:02
minutes.
Do people have any questions

484
29:04
about Freud or Freud's theories?

485
29:06


486
29:10
Yes.
Student:

487
29:14
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

488
29:18
So, that's some question.
The question is:

489
29:22
The conflicts in psychosexual
development that Freud describes

490
29:27
is--always assumes that a child
has a mother and a father,

491
29:32
one of each,
in a certain sort of familial

492
29:34
structure.
And the question then is,

493
29:37
"What if a child was raised by
a single parent,

494
29:40
for example?"
What if a child was never

495
29:42
breast fed, but fed from the
bottle from the start?

496
29:45
And Freudians have had problems
with this.

497
29:49
Freud's--Freud was very focused
on the family life of the people

498
29:54
he interacted with,
which is rather upper class

499
29:57
Europeans, and these sort of
questions would have been

500
30:00
difficult for Freud to answer.
I imagine that what a Freudian

501
30:03
would have to say is,
you would expect systematic

502
30:06
differences.
So, you would expect a child

503
30:08
who just grew up with a mother
or just grew up to be a

504
30:11
father--with a father to be in
some sense psychologically

505
30:14
damaged by that,
failing to go through the

506
30:17
normal psychosexual stages.
Yes.

507
30:21
Student:
[inaudible]

508
30:24
Professor Paul Bloom:
The issue--The question is,

509
30:29
"Do modern psychoanalysts still
believe that women do not have

510
30:34
superegos?"
Freud was--As you're pointing

511
30:37
out, Freud was notorious for
pointing, for suggesting that

512
30:41
women were morally immature
relative to men.

513
30:44
I think Freud would say that
women have superegos,

514
30:47
they're just not the sort of
sturdy ones that men have.

515
30:50
I think psychoanalysts and
psychoanalytic scholars right

516
30:54
now would be mixed.
Some would maintain that there

517
30:56
really are deep sex differences.
Others would want to jettison

518
30:59
that aspect of Freudian theory.

519
31:01


520
31:05
Yes.
Student:

521
31:08
Do you define sublimation as
being displacement?

522
31:10
Does that make it sort of a
subgroup of displacement?

523
31:14
Professor Paul Bloom:
Well, what sublimation is--A

524
31:16
lot of these--It's a good
question.

525
31:18
The question is sort of,
what is sublimation?

526
31:20
How does it relate to the other
defense mechanisms?

527
31:22
A lot of defense mechanisms
involve taking a desire and

528
31:28
turning it.
Now, what displacement does is

529
31:32
it takes it from you to her.
I'm angry at you but maybe

530
31:36
that's forbidden for some
reason, so I'll be angry at her.

531
31:39
What projection does is takes a
desire from me and then puts it

532
31:43
on somebody else heading
outwards.

533
31:46
And what sublimation does is it
just gives up the details and

534
31:50
keeps the energy.
So, you stay up--Your roommate

535
31:53
stays up all night working and
you say to your roommate,

536
31:56
for instance,
"That's just because you

537
31:58
haven't had sex in a long time
and you want to have sex so you

538
32:02
devote all your energy to your
math exam."

539
32:04
And then you say,
"That's sublimation.

540
32:07
I learned that in Intro Psych."
And your roommate would be very

541
32:12
pleased.
One more question.

542
32:14


543
32:23
Yes.
Student:

544
32:26
What kind of evidence is there
for cross-cultural variation?

545
32:30
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question is,

546
32:32
which is related to the
issue--extending the issue of

547
32:34
the two-parent versus one-parent
family is,

548
32:36
"To what extent are these
notions validated

549
32:38
cross-culturally?"
And that's such a good question

550
32:41
I'm going to defer it.
I'm going to talk about it in a

551
32:43
few minutes because that's
actually--That speaks to the

552
32:46
issue of the scientific
assessment of Freud so I'm going

553
32:49
to try to get to your question
in a little bit.

554
32:51


555
32:55
Freudian theory is now,
at this point of time,

556
33:00
extremely controversial and
there is a lot of well-known

557
33:05
criticisms and attacks on Freud.
This is just actually an

558
33:10
excellent book on The Memory
Wars by Frederick Crews,

559
33:14
which--and Frederick Crews is
one of the strongest and most

560
33:18
passionate critics of Freud.
And the problems with Freud go

561
33:24
like this.
There are two ways you could

562
33:28
reject a theory.
There are two problems with the

563
33:31
scientific theory.
One way you could reject a

564
33:34
theory is that it could be
wrong.

565
33:37
So, suppose I have a theory
that the reason why some

566
33:40
children have autism,
a profound developmental

567
33:43
disorder,
is because their mothers don't

568
33:45
love them enough.
This was a popular theory for

569
33:48
many years.
It's a possible theory.

570
33:52
It just turns out to be wrong
but another way--And so one way

571
33:57
to attack and address a
scientific theory is to view it

572
34:01
as just to see whether or not it
works.

573
34:05
But there's a different problem
a theory could have.

574
34:08
A theory could be so vague and
all encompassing that it can't

575
34:14
even be tested.
And this is one of the main

576
34:18
critiques of Freud.
The idea could be summed up by

577
34:22
a quotation from the physicist
Wolfgang Pauli.

578
34:26
And Pauli was asked his opinion
about another physicist.

579
34:30
And Pauli said this:
"That guy's work is crap.

580
34:35
He's not right.
He's not even wrong."

581
34:39
And the criticism about Freud
is that he's not even wrong.

582
34:44
The issue of vagueness is
summarized in a more technical

583
34:49
way by the philosopher Karl
Popper who described--who

584
34:54
introduced the term of
falsifiability.

585
34:58
The idea of falsifiability is
that what distinguishes science

586
35:03
from non science is that
scientific predictions make

587
35:07
strong claims about the world
and these claims are of a sort

588
35:12
that they could be proven wrong.
If they couldn't be proven

589
35:17
wrong, they're not interesting
enough to be science.

590
35:20
So, for example,
within psychology the sort of

591
35:22
claims we'll be entertaining
throughout the course include

592
35:25
claims like,
damage to the hippocampus

593
35:27
causes failures of certain sorts
of memory, or everywhere in the

594
35:32
world men on average want to
have more sexual partners than

595
35:36
women,
or exposure to violent

596
35:38
television tends to make
children themselves more

597
35:42
violent.
Now, are they true or are they

598
35:45
false?
Well, we'll talk about that,

599
35:47
but the point here is they can
be false.

600
35:50
They're interesting enough that
they can be tested and as such

601
35:54
they go to--they might be wrong
but they graduate to the level

602
35:59
of a scientific theory.
This should be contrasted with

603
36:03
nonscientific programs and the
best example of a nonscientific

604
36:08
program is astrology.
So, the problem with

605
36:11
astrological predictions is not
that they're wrong.

606
36:16
It's that they can't be wrong.
They're not even wrong.

607
36:18
I did my--I got my horoscope
for today on the web.

608
36:25
"A couple of negative aspects
could make you a little finicky

609
36:28
for the next few days."
Okay.

610
36:30
I'm going to watch for that.
"The presence of both Mars and

611
36:33
Venus suggests you want to box
everything into a neat,

612
36:35
ordered, structured way but
keeping a piece of jade or

613
36:38
carnelian close will help you
keep in touch with your fun

614
36:41
side."
And starting this morning I got

615
36:43
from my wife a little piece of
jade and I have been sort of in

616
36:45
touch with my fun side.
The problem is,

617
36:47
a few days aren't going to go
by and say, "God.

618
36:50
That was wrong."
It can't be wrong.

619
36:52
It's just so vague.
I got a better horoscope from

620
36:57
The Onion actually:
"Riding in a golf cart with

621
37:01
snow cone in hand,
you'll be tackled by two police

622
37:04
officers this week after
matching a composite caricature

623
37:06
of a suspected murderer."
Now, that's a good prediction

624
37:13
because "wow."
If it turns out to be true,

625
37:18
I'm going to say,
"Those guys really know

626
37:20
something."
It's falsifiable.

627
37:24
Arguably, Freud fails the test
because Freudian theory is often

628
37:30
so vague and flexible that it
can't really be tested in any

629
37:35
reliable way.
A big problem with this is a

630
37:38
lot of Freudian theory is
claimed to be validated in the

631
37:41
course of psychoanalysis.
So, when you ask people,

632
37:44
"Why do you believe in Freud?"
they won't say,

633
37:46
"Oh, because of this
experiment, that experiment,

634
37:47
this data set and that data
set."

635
37:49
What they'll say is,
"It's--The Freudian theory

636
37:51
proves itself in the course of
psychoanalysis – the success

637
37:55
of psychoanalysis."
But it's unreliable.

638
37:58
The problem is,
say, Freud says to a patient,

639
38:00
"You hate your mother."
The patient says, "Wow.

640
38:03
That makes sense."
Freud says, "I'm right."

641
38:07
The patient--Freud says,
"You hate your mother," and the

642
38:09
patient says,
"No, I don't.

643
38:11
That's titillating.
That's disgusting."

644
38:15
Freud says, "Your anger shows
this idea is painful to you.

645
38:16
You have repressed it from
consciousness.

646
38:18
I am right."
And the problem is the same

647
38:21
sort of dynamic plays itself out
even in the scientific debate

648
38:27
back and forth.
So Freud--Freudian

649
38:30
psychologists--I'm putting Freud
here but what I mean is

650
38:33
well-known defenders of Freud
will make some claims like:

651
38:36
adult personality traits are
shaped by the course of

652
38:39
psychosexual development;
all dreams are disguised wish

653
38:42
fulfillment;
psychoanalysis is the best

654
38:44
treatment for mental disorders.
Scientists will respond,

655
38:46
"I disagree.
There's little or no evidence

656
38:48
supporting those claims."
And the Freudian response is,

657
38:50
"Your rejection of my ideas
shows that they are distressing

658
38:53
to you.
This is because I am right."

659
38:55
And this is often followed up,
seriously enough.

660
38:58
"You have deep psychological
problems."

661
39:02
And now, I don't want to
caricature Freudians.

662
39:09
A lot of Freudians have tried
and made a research program of

663
39:13
extending their ideas
scientifically,

664
39:16
bringing them to robust
scientific tests.

665
39:20
But the problem is,
when you make specific

666
39:23
falsifiable predictions they
don't always do that well.

667
39:28
So, for instance,
there's no evidence that oral

668
39:30
and anal characteristics,
the personality characteristics

669
39:33
I talked about – about being
needy versus being stingy –

670
39:36
relate in any interesting way to
weaning or toilet training.

671
39:40
And there's been some efforts
cross-culturally,

672
39:42
to go back to the question this
young man asked before –

673
39:46
looking at cross-cultural
differences in toilet training

674
39:49
and weaning,
which are really big

675
39:51
differences, to see if they
correspond in any interesting

676
39:54
way to personality differences.
And there's been no good

677
39:58
evidence supporting that.
Similarly, Freud had some

678
40:01
strong claims about sexuality,
for why some people are

679
40:04
straight and others are gay.
These have met with very little

680
40:10
empirical support.
And the claim that

681
40:13
psychoanalysis proves itself by
being--by its tremendous success

682
40:17
in curing mental illness is also
almost certainly not true.

683
40:21
For most--Maybe not all,
but for most psychological

684
40:24
disorders, there are quicker and
more reliable treatments than

685
40:27
psychoanalysis.
And there's considerable

686
40:30
controversy as to whether the
Tony Soprano method of insight,

687
40:34
where you get this insight and
there's discovery,

688
40:38
"Oh, now I know," makes any
real difference in alleviating

689
40:42
symptoms such as anxiety
disorders or depression.

690
40:47
This is why there's sort
of--often sort of a sticker

691
40:50
shock when people go to a
university psychology department

692
40:55
where they say,
"Look.

693
40:56
Hey.
Where is--So I'm in Psych.

694
40:58
How could I take classes on
Freud?

695
41:00
Who's your expert on Freud?"
And the truth is Freudian

696
41:05
psychoanalysis is almost never
studied inside psychology

697
41:09
departments.
Not the cognitive or

698
41:11
developmental side,
not the clinical side.

699
41:14
There are some exceptions but,
for the most part,

700
41:17
even the people who do study
Freud within psychology

701
41:21
departments do so critically.
Very few of them would see

702
41:25
themselves as a psychoanalytic
practitioner or as a Freudian

703
41:29
psychologist.
Freud lives on both in a

704
41:32
clinical setting and in the
university but Freud at Yale,

705
41:36
for instance,
is much more likely to be found

706
41:38
in the history department or the
literature department than in

707
41:40
the psychology department.
And this is typical enough but,

708
41:45
despite all of the,
sort of, sour things I just

709
41:50
said about Freud,
the big idea,

710
41:53
the importance of the dynamic
unconscious, remains intact.

711
41:59
We will go over and over and
over again different case

712
42:03
studies where some really
interesting aspects of mental

713
42:07
life prove to be unconscious.
Now, there's one question.

714
42:12
I'm actually going to skip over
this for reasons of time and

715
42:17
just go to some examples of the
unconscious in modern

716
42:22
psychology.
So, here's a simple example of

717
42:27
the unconscious in modern
psychology: Language

718
42:32
understanding.
So, when you hear a sentence

719
42:36
like, "John thinks that Bill
likes him," in a fraction of a

720
42:42
second you realize that this
means that John thinks that Bill

721
42:47
likes John.
If you heard the

722
42:49
sentence--Oops--"John thinks
that Bill likes himself," in a

723
42:53
fraction of a second you would
think that it means "John thinks

724
42:57
that Bill likes Bill."
And as we will get to when we

725
43:00
get to the lecture on language,
this is not conscious.

726
43:02
You don't know how you do this.
You don't even know that you

727
43:05
are doing this but you do it
quickly and instinctively.

728
43:09
So much of our day-to-day life
can be done unconsciously.

729
43:13
There are different activities
you can do – driving,

730
43:17
chewing gum,
shoelace tying – where if

731
43:19
you're good enough at them,
if you're expert enough at

732
43:23
them, you don't know you're
doing them.

733
43:25
I was at a party a few years
ago for a friend of mine and we

734
43:29
ran out of food so he said,
"I'll just go pick up some

735
43:32
food."
An hour later he was

736
43:34
gone--still gone and it was
around the corner.

737
43:37
And we called him up on his
cell phone and he said,

738
43:40
"Oh.
I got on the highway and I

739
43:44
drove to work."
Yeah.

740
43:47
He works an hour away but he
got on the highway "drive drive

741
43:49
drive."
And these--some version of

742
43:52
these things happen all of the
time.

743
43:55


744
43:59
Maybe more surprising,
Freud's insight that our likes

745
44:03
and dislikes are due to factors
that we're not necessarily

746
44:08
conscious of has a lot of
empirical support--a lot of

747
44:12
empirical support from research
into social psychology,

748
44:17
for example.
So, here's one finding from

749
44:20
social psychology.
If somebody goes through a

750
44:25
terrible initiation to get into
a club, they'll like the club

751
44:32
more.
You might think they'd like it

752
44:34
less because people do terrible
things to them.

753
44:36
But actually,
hazing is illegal but a

754
44:40
remarkably successful tool.
The more you pay for something

755
44:45
the more you like it and the
more pain you go through to get

756
44:49
something the more you like it.
From the standpoint of politics

757
44:53
for instance,
if you want loyal people in a

758
44:57
political campaign,
do not pay them.

759
45:00
If you pay them,
they'll like you less.

760
45:03
If they volunteer,
they'll like you more.

761
45:07
And we'll talk about why.
There's different theories

762
45:10
about why, but my point right
now is simply that people don't

763
45:14
necessarily know this but still
they're subject to this.

764
45:18
Another example is some weird
studies done in a discipline of

765
45:23
social psychology known as
terror management which involves

766
45:28
subliminal death primes.
The idea of subliminal death

767
45:33
primes is this.
You sign up for your human

768
45:35
subjects requirement and then
you--they put you in front of a

769
45:39
computer screen and then they
tell you,

770
45:41
"Oh, just sit in front of the
computer screen and then we'll

771
45:44
ask you some questions."
And then the questions come out

772
45:46
and they're questions like,
"How much do you love your

773
45:49
country?"
"What do you think of Asians?"

774
45:52
"What do you think of Jews?"
"What do you think of blacks?"

775
45:55
"What do you think of
vegetarians?"

776
45:56
"What do you think of people's
political views different from

777
45:59
yours?"
Here's the gimmick.

778
46:01
What you don't know is on that
computer screen words are being

779
46:06
flashed like that but they're
being flashed so fast it looks

780
46:12
like that--You don't see
anything--words like "corpse,"

781
46:17
"dead," "dying."
The flashing of these

782
46:21
subliminal words,
"subliminal" meaning – a

783
46:24
fancy term meaning below the
level of consciousness,

784
46:28
you don't know you're seeing
them – has dramatic effects on

785
46:31
how you answer those questions.
People exposed to death primes

786
46:36
become more nationalistic,
more patriotic,

787
46:41
less forgiving of other people,
less liking of other races and

788
46:46
people from other countries.
Again the claim--the

789
46:49
explanation for why this is so
is something which we'll get to

790
46:53
in another class.
The point now is simply to

791
46:56
illustrate that these sort of
things can have--that things you

792
47:00
aren't aware of can have an
effect on how you think.

793
47:04
The final example I'll give of
this is a short demonstration.

794
47:09
To do this, I'm going to cut
the class in half at this point

795
47:13
so you'll be on this side of the
class,

796
47:15
the right side,
my right, and this will be on

797
47:20
the left side,
and I simply want everybody to

798
47:26
think about somebody you love.
So, think about somebody you

799
47:32
love, your girlfriend,
your boyfriend,

800
47:34
your mom, your dad.
Think about somebody you love.

801
47:37
Just think.
Okay.

802
47:40
Now, on this screen is going to
be instructions but I want to

803
47:45
give the instructions to this
half of the class .

804
47:48
I'm going to ask everybody in
this half of the class please

805
47:51
either turn your head or shut
your eyes.

806
47:53
Okay?
Teaching fellows too.

807
47:56
Okay.
And everybody on this half obey

808
48:02
.
Okay.

809
48:03
Has everybody read that?
Okay.

810
48:09
Now, turn your head, this group.
Now this group:

811
48:17
Look at this and take a moment.
You don't have to do it on

812
48:26
paper but take a moment to do it
in your head.

813
48:30
You--Each group had
instructions.

814
48:31
Some people might have seen
both instructions.

815
48:33
Follow the instructions you got
for you.

816
48:39
Now, this was research done by
Norbert Schwarz and here's the

817
48:45
question I want you to ask
yourself, "How much do you like

818
48:51
this person?"
And here's the effect:

819
48:54
Half of you were asked to list
three features of the person.

820
48:58
Half of you were asked to list
ten.

821
49:01
The finding,
which is not a subtle finding,

822
49:03
is that liking goes up in the
three group and liking goes down

823
49:08
in the ten group.
And here is why.

824
49:10
I have to think about three
positive features of somebody so

825
49:18
I think about my girlfriend.
I have a girlfriend.

826
49:22
I think about my girlfriend,
"but oh, she's smart,

827
49:24
she's beautiful and she's kind.
Good.

828
49:27
How much do--What do I think of
her?

829
49:30
"Pretty, good,
smart, beautiful,

830
49:32
kind, smart,
beautiful, oh,

831
49:33
yeah."
But the problem--;Now,

832
49:35
Schwarz is clever though.
He says, "List--" The other

833
49:38
group gets ten positive
features, "smart,

834
49:40
beautiful,
kind… really nice… good

835
49:45
cook… punctual,
smart… No,

836
49:51
I mentioned that."
The problem is nobody has ten

837
49:57
positive features!
And the effect of being asked

838
50:01
to do ten positive features is
people find this hard.

839
50:05
And then those people,
when asked, "How much do you

840
50:08
like this person?"
say, "Couldn't really make it

841
50:13
that ten.
I guess I don't like them very

842
50:16
much."
Now, the point of this

843
50:18
illustration,
again, is that it shows that

844
50:22
you don't know this.
Subjects who were asked to do

845
50:25
ten positive features and then
later ranked the person lower

846
50:29
and then asked,
"Why did you rank the person

847
50:31
lower?"
Don't say, "'Cause you told me

848
50:34
to list ten."
Typically, we are oblivious to

849
50:37
these factors that change our
points – what we like and what

850
50:41
we dislike – and this is,
in fact, a substantial and an

851
50:45
important part of the study of
psychology, and particularly,

852
50:48
for instance,
the study of racial and sexual

853
50:51
prejudice.
Where--One of the big findings

854
50:54
from social psychology,
and we'll devote almost an

855
50:56
entire lecture to this,
is that people have strong

856
51:00
views about other races that
they don't know about and that

857
51:05
they don't know how to control
their actions.

858
51:10
So, to some extent,
this rounds out Freud because

859
51:14
to some extent the particulars
of Freud are--for the most part

860
51:20
have been rejected.
But the general idea of Freud's

861
51:24
actually been so successful both
in the study of scientific

862
51:28
psychology and in our
interpretation of everyday life

863
51:32
that,
to some extent,

864
51:33
Freud's been a victim of his
own success.

865
51:36
We tend to underestimate the
importance of Freudian thought

866
51:40
in everyday life because he's
transformed our world view to

867
51:44
such an extent that it's
difficult for us to remember if

868
51:48
there's any other way to think
about it.

869
51:52
So, to some extent,
he's been the victim of his own

870
51:54
success.
We have time for some further

871
51:57
questions about Freud and about
scientific implications of

872
52:00
Freud.

873
52:01


874
52:07
I took a class once on how to
teach when I was a graduate

875
52:10
student.
And I just remember two things

876
52:12
from this class.
One thing is never grade in red

877
52:16
pen.
Those--People don't like that.

878
52:18
The second thing is never ask
any questions,

879
52:21
because presumably it is very
frightening to ask,

880
52:23
"Any questions?"
and people find it's

881
52:25
intimidating.
I'm supposed to ask,

882
52:28
"What are your questions?"
So, what are your questions?

883
52:33
Yes, in back.
Sorry.

884
52:37
Student:
Did Freud believe in

885
52:39
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

886
52:41
Did Freud believe in
[inaudible]

887
52:42
Student:
Medication Professor Paul

888
52:44
Bloom: Medication.
Freud had an--It's a good

889
52:47
question.
The question was,

890
52:49
"Does--did Freud believe in
medication?"

891
52:51
Medication, of course,
being a major theme of how we

892
52:54
deal with certain disorders now,
particularly depression and

893
52:57
anxiety disorders.
On the one hand,

894
52:59
Freud made his start as a
neuroscientist.

895
53:02
Freud studied the mind and the
brain and was intensely

896
53:07
interested in the neural basis
of thought and behavior.

897
53:12
But the answer to your question
in the end is,

898
53:14
"no."
Although Freud was very

899
53:16
sensitive to the brain basis of
behavior, Freud was totally

900
53:19
convinced that the method
through which to cure disorders

901
53:22
like depression and anxiety
would not be medication but

902
53:25
rather through the sort of talk
therapy and insight.

903
53:28
Moreover, modern therapists,
including some people who

904
53:33
aren't psychoanalytically
defined, will say,

905
53:37
"Look.
These drugs are all well and

906
53:40
good but what they do is they
mask the symptoms."

907
53:43
So, if you have panic attacks,
say, it's true that drugs might

908
53:47
make the panic attacks go away,
but the panic attacks are

909
53:51
actually not your real problem.
And by making them go away you

910
53:54
don't get to the root of your
problem.

911
53:57
So, the answer is both Freud
and modern day psychoanalysts

912
54:00
would think that medications are
substantially overused in the

913
54:03
treatment of mental disorders.
Yes.

914
54:06
Student:
Are there any [inaudible]

915
54:09
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question is,

916
54:12
"What about research on
dreams?"

917
54:15
"Dreams" is such a fun topic
that I'm going to devote half a

918
54:19
class to sleeping and dreams.
So, for instance,

919
54:22
I will answer the question
"What is the most common dream?"

920
54:25
I will also answer the question
"Who thinks about sex more in

921
54:28
dreams, men or women,
and what proportion of--" Oh.

922
54:31
There's so many great questions
I will answer.

923
54:33
Dreams from a Freudian
standpoint.

924
54:36
There's been some evidence that
dreams do, and some often do,

925
54:40
have some relationship to what
you're thinking about and

926
54:44
worrying about through the day.
But the strong Freudian view

927
54:48
about symbolism and wish
fulfillment has not been

928
54:51
supported by the study of
dreams.

929
54:53


930
54:56
What are your other questions?
Yes, whoever Erik is pointing

931
55:03
to.
Professor Paul Bloom:

932
55:04
Purple shirt.
Yes.

933
55:07
Student:
[inaudible]--Electra complex?

934
55:09
Professor Paul Bloom:
The Electra complex?

935
55:11
The Electra complex is the
penis envy story.

936
55:16
Freud developed--This is a
crude summary,

937
55:19
but Freud developed the Oedipal
complex, "Mom,

938
55:23
I love Mommy,
Dad."

939
55:25
And then it's as if somebody
reminded him,

940
55:28
"Sigmund, there are also
women."

941
55:30
"Oh, yeah."
And that story I told you with

942
55:33
the penises and the penis envy
and the replacement is sort of a

943
55:37
very shortened version of the
Electra complex.

944
55:40
I think it's fair to say that
the Electra complex was a sort

945
55:45
of add-on to the main interest
of Freud's Oedipal complex.

946
55:50
One more, please.
Yes.

947
55:54
Student:
[inaudible]

948
55:58
Professor Paul Bloom:
According to Freud,

949
56:05
the--there's not a fixation in
the stage, in the same sense as

950
56:10
an oral or anal stage,
but yes.

951
56:12
The claim that Freud would make
is that the woman's discovery

952
56:16
that she lacks the penis plays a
fundamental role later on

953
56:19
determining her allegiances in
life and in fact her own sexual

954
56:23
preferences and interests.
So, it's not the sort of thing

955
56:27
that affects her just for a
short period.

956
56:30
