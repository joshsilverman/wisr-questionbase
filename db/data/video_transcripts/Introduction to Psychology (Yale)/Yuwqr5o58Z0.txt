Professor Paul Bloom:
I'll begin the class officially

2
0:16
with a different sort of
demonstration.

3
0:18
I want to just show you one of
the change-blindness studies

4
0:21
that has been done in the real
world.

5
0:23


6
0:29
And these videotapes are not
available publicly.

7
0:33
We get them from the web and
see them as little Java scripts.

8
0:37
So, this is one of the first
studies done by Dan Simons when

9
0:41
he was at Cornell.
And his adviser at the time was

10
0:45
our Frank Keil,
who's now in our department.

11
0:48
So, here's the study.

12
0:49


13
1:05
[laughter]
And you don't notice it.

14
1:10
Change blindness is one of the
more striking phenomena

15
1:15
discovered by laboratory
scientists and by psychologists.

16
1:21
But it's important to realize,
to get away from the sort of

17
1:24
surprise of the gorilla and the
fact that it's hard to see the

18
1:28
flickering--the object that's
flickering,

19
1:31
and appreciate the big moral of
this, because the big moral of

20
1:33
this is actually,
I think, striking and quite

21
1:36
important.
You think right now that you're

22
1:40
perceiving the world.
I look down on you and I think

23
1:43
I have a whole sense of where
everybody is.

24
1:46
I can't see everybody perfectly
in back.

25
1:48
You're kind of far away and
blurry but there's a sense in

26
1:52
which I have a world around me.
Similarly, if I'm to close my

27
1:57
eyes for a second,
everything just remains and I

28
2:01
could sort of remember some of
the things that are there.

29
2:06
That's really good sound
localization by me .

30
2:08
So you're looking up and you
think you have a sense of the

31
2:13
world both in perception and
memory.

32
2:16
The change-blindness experiment
suggested this isn't true.

33
2:19
The change-blindness experiment
suggests that if you look at me

34
2:23
for a second and during that
second all of your classmates

35
2:28
change positions,
including those next to you,

36
2:31
you are extremely unlikely to
notice.

37
2:33
The change-blindness experiment
suggests that if you turn your

38
2:37
eyes away from me towards there
for a second and turn back,

39
2:40
and I'm dressed entirely
differently, you wouldn't

40
2:44
notice.
The exceptions would be if you

41
2:46
told yourself consciously,
"Remember what this guy is

42
2:49
wearing;
he's wearing this,

43
2:50
that and the other."
But if you don't do it

44
2:53
consciously you'll lose it,
and usually this is okay.

45
2:59
Usually, it's okay because your
memory and your visual system

46
3:03
exploits a basic fact about the
universe,

47
3:05
which is that most things stay
the same most of the time.

48
3:09
I don't have to explicitly
remember that you're over there

49
3:13
when I turn my head for a second
because you'll be over there in

50
3:17
any case.
You don't need to hold precise

51
3:19
representations of the world.
And so you only notice it in

52
3:23
certain clever circumstances.
One sort of clever circumstance

53
3:28
is when psychologists change
reality as in the

54
3:30
change-blindness studies.
A second sort of circumstance

55
3:34
is in movies.
So, one of the big surprises

56
3:37
when people started making
movies involving cuts was it is

57
3:42
extremely difficult to get
everything continuously right.

58
3:46
And you need to work very hard
to notice.

59
3:49
So, there's all of these
continuity errors that creep up

60
3:52
into movies and you have to be a
film buff or writing it down to

61
3:55
even notice this.
And the overall moral here then

62
3:59
is that your perception of
reality is a lot more sparse,

63
4:03
a lot more limited,
than you might think it is.

64
4:07
So, this is where we were at
the end of last class.

65
4:11
We were talking about the
different sorts of memories:

66
4:14
Sensory memory,
which is the sort of fraction

67
4:17
of a second of sensory residue
of what you're hearing and what

68
4:20
you're seeing,
working memory,

69
4:22
short-term memory,
and then long-term memory.

70
4:26
And we talked last class about
how things get into sensory

71
4:29
memory, into working memory,
the role of attention.

72
4:32
And in fact,
the change-blindness studies

73
4:34
are actually just studies of how
something gets from your senses

74
4:38
to your consciousness and what
does and what doesn't.

75
4:41
Now I want to move to the
distinction between working

76
4:45
memory, short-term memory,
and long-term memory.

77
4:49
Now, the obvious distinction is
actually just in fact--is

78
4:55
storage differences.
So, long-term memory or "LTM"

79
5:01
has a huge storage capacity.
This is your memory like the

80
5:06
hard drive of your computer.
This is the memory you walk

81
5:09
around with.
It includes all the words in

82
5:12
English, just for example,
60 to 80,000 words.

83
5:15
It includes everybody you've
ever met, languages,

84
5:20
faces, stories,
locations, nursery rhymes,

85
5:24
songs, TV programs.
Nobody knows the storage.

86
5:28
It is not true that you
remember everything that has

87
5:31
ever happened to you.
There's no reason to believe

88
5:34
that this is true.
At the same time though,

89
5:37
you have a huge amount stored
in your brain in long-term

90
5:41
storage and nobody actually--It
has to be limited because it's a

91
5:45
finite,
limited brain.

92
5:47
But nobody knows how big it is.
Nobody knows how many terabytes

93
5:52
you carry around in your brain
and--but it's a lot.

94
5:56
Compare this to working memory
– the short-term memory,

95
6:00
which is actually very limited.
Your memory of what you could

96
6:05
store on--in--where you could
hold in consciousness right now

97
6:08
is quite limited.
Here is an exercise.

98
6:12
Do not write these things down.
I want you to remember them.

99
6:15
I'm just going to give you a
few numbers: 14,59,

100
6:28
11,109, 43,58,
98,487, 25,389,

101
6:36
54.
Please write them down.

102
6:40


103
6:58
View this as an IQ test if that
would relax you.

104
7:02


105
7:10
How many of you who decided to
participate in this experiment

106
7:16
got three or less?
Good.

107
7:18
Good.
Four, five, six,

108
7:25
seven, eight,
nine or more?

109
7:33
Anybody get all eleven?
This is a particularly

110
7:38
difficult memory task.
The numbers are meaningless.

111
7:42
And I told--and I forgot to
tell you to get your pen and

112
7:45
pencil ready,
so some of you just glared at

113
7:47
me.
But [laughter]

114
7:48
under normal circumstances the
cognitive psychologist George

115
7:53
Miller said that this sort of
suggested that the standard

116
7:57
memory storage of short-term
memory is seven,

117
8:01
plus or minus two.
And what that means is anywhere

118
8:06
from five to nine roughly.
Some of you,

119
8:09
I bet, can beat that.
Some of you on a not-so-good

120
8:13
day maybe won't make it that
much.

121
8:16
Now "seven plus or minus two"
is what you--;so,

122
8:20
that's what you hold in
consciousness.

123
8:22
I can tell you 14,21.
You walk around,

124
8:26
"Oh, yeah, 14,21."
You hold that in consciousness

125
8:29
with no problem.
But I throw eleven numbers at

126
8:31
you, you can't.
Some dribble out.

127
8:33
You can't hold that in your
conscious window in your

128
8:36
short-term memory.
Now, this raises the question

129
8:40
"seven plus or minus two" what?
And the answer seems to be what

130
8:46
George Miller calls "chunks."
And a chunk is a basic memory

131
8:51
unit, something you think of as
a single, individual entity.

132
8:57
So, suppose you see the string
of letters "L,

133
9:01
A, M, A, I, S,
O, N."

134
9:03
If you don't know--If you can't
form these into words and you

135
9:08
have to remember them,
these are eight chunks.

136
9:11
You have to just pick them up
separately.

137
9:13
On the other hand,
if you break them up into four

138
9:17
words you could just remember it
as four chunks.

139
9:22
And if you break it up into two
words in French,

140
9:26
"la maison," "the house," it
could just be one or two.

141
9:31
How much you know
depends--affects how much you

142
9:34
memorize--how much you could
store in memory because it

143
9:39
affects what counts as a basic
unit of memory.

144
9:43
And there's all sorts of
examples of this.

145
9:45
If I tell you "1,1,
0,1, 1,0, 0,1,

146
9:48
0,1, 1,0," those of you who
don't know binary numbers might

147
9:54
have to remember that as "1,
1,0, 0," whatever I said.

148
10:00
Those of you who are computer
scientists or mathematicians or,

149
10:04
for whatever reason,
know binary numbers could

150
10:07
convert it into a single binary
number.

151
10:09
Anybody know what the number is?
No, I cannot say it again.

152
10:17
[laughter]
Some number,

153
10:18
24, or not 24--to some number,
24, and then you remember "24."

154
10:22
It's easier.
Suppose you see a chessboard

155
10:25
and the chessboard is set up and
you don't know how to play

156
10:30
chess.
It is murderously hard to

157
10:32
remember that.
They've done the experiments.

158
10:34
They've taken people in a lab
who don't know how to play

159
10:36
chess.
They set up a chessboard and

160
10:38
then they say,
"Okay.

161
10:39
Look at this for five minutes."
Then they take it away,

162
10:43
set it up again,
and it's murderously hard.

163
10:46
"There is a horse-y thing on
the side there and everything."

164
10:50
But if these chess pieces are
set up in some way that's

165
10:54
logical for a chess player,
then a chess master could look

166
10:59
at it and remember it in a
glance, "Oh.

167
11:02
It's the Fibonacci defense" or
something like that [laughs],

168
11:06
and then immediately recover
it.

169
11:08
Similarly, football coaches
have been tested on their

170
11:12
memories of football diagrams.
And they have a photographic

171
11:15
memory for football diagrams
because it corresponds to things

172
11:18
that make sense.
Architects could have a

173
11:20
photographic memory,
a perfect memory for floor

174
11:24
plans because it makes sense to
them.

175
11:27
They understand it.
And so the way you store things

176
11:32
in memory, and this is a theme
we're going to return to when we

177
11:36
get to long-term memory,
depends in a large extent on

178
11:40
how much you understand it.
And this shows up in expertise

179
11:45
effects.
Now, this is what's happening

180
11:48
so far in short-term memory,
how much you hold in there.

181
11:53
The question is how do you get
it into long-term memory?

182
11:56
So, you have long-term memory,
your major storage system.

183
12:00
How does information get from
your consciousness to long-term

184
12:06
storage?
Well, there's one

185
12:08
thing--there's one way which
sort of works sometimes but not

186
12:12
very well.
And it's called "maintenance

187
12:14
rehearsal."
Suppose I said you have to

188
12:17
remember this number,
this string of numbers.

189
12:20
And if you remember it in
twenty minutes you will get one

190
12:23
thousand dollars.
And the string is my phone

191
12:27
number when I was a kid.
I'll include the area code:

192
12:32
514-688-9057.
Now, if you tell that to a

193
12:35
four-year-old,
well, the four-year-old will

194
12:38
say, "I'll remember it."
And then you ask them,

195
12:40
"What did I just say?"
"Well, I don't know."

196
12:43
If you tell it to an--because
you know something--If a lot

197
12:46
depended on it,
you would know to do something.

198
12:49
What you would do is you'd say
to yourself, "514-688-9057,51

199
12:53
4-688-9057,514-688 --" You'd
rehearse it in your head over

200
12:56
and over again.
The problem is you could hold

201
13:00
it as long as you can do that.
It's like these movies.

202
13:04
You see this all the time,
like an episode of 24:

203
13:07
"Jack, call CTU and tell them
Agent 11 is trapped in a--" And

204
13:11
I can't even remember this but
the way to remember it is you

205
13:14
hold--you've just got to repeat
it over and over again in your

206
13:17
head.
But this will not typically get

207
13:20
things into long-term memory.
To get things into long-term

208
13:25
memory, rehearsal is usually not
enough.

209
13:28
You need to do other things.
Typically, what you need is

210
13:34
structure and organization.
And one way to demonstrate this

211
13:39
was in a classic "depth of
processing" experiment which

212
13:42
nicely illustrates the fact that
the more you structure

213
13:45
something,
the deeper you think about it,

214
13:48
the better it gets entrenched
in the long-term memory.

215
13:52
So, in this study what they did
was they asked people--they told

216
13:55
people that there's going to be
words flashed on a screen.

217
13:59
And all of the subjects saw the
same strings of words.

218
14:02
There were forty-eight words.
They were not told to memorize

219
14:06
the words.
One third of the subjects was

220
14:09
told, "Look.
Some of these words are going

221
14:12
to come out in capital letters,
some of them not capital

222
14:15
letters.
Press a button for capitals,

223
14:17
non-capitals."
"Sure."

224
14:19
The other group was told,
"Some of these words will rhyme

225
14:22
with 'train,' Others won't.
Press a button if it rhymes in

226
14:26
'train'."
The third group was told,

227
14:28
"Does it fit into the sentence
‘The girl placed the blank on

228
14:32
the table'?
Press a button if it does.

229
14:34
Press a button if it doesn't."
Then they were asked as a

230
14:38
surprise, "What words did you
see?"

231
14:41
And the findings looked like
this.

232
14:43
When they were asked to focus
on just what the word looked

233
14:47
like, memory was very poor,
the sound better,

234
14:50
the meaning better.
If you want to remember

235
14:54
something, the best way to
remember it is to give it

236
14:58
meaning, to give it sense.
This is illustrated through a

237
15:03
very ancient technique,
which is that the way to

238
15:06
remember things that are
otherwise arbitrary is to give

239
15:10
them some organization through
memory tricks,

240
15:14
through vivid imagery or songs
or poetry.

241
15:21
And there's a lot of examples
of this.

242
15:24
Do you know how to remember
that the hippocampus--There's a

243
15:27
part of the brain called the
hippocampus.

244
15:29
This is the worst memory trick
ever but it will stick with you

245
15:33
for twenty years.
The hippocampus is involved in

246
15:36
spatial memory.
It's involved in finding your

247
15:40
way around.
Think to yourself,

248
15:43
"The way I find my way around
campus is through the

249
15:48
hippocampus."
And you think,

250
15:50
"Well, that's stupid," but
you'll never forget now that the

251
15:52
hippocampus is in charge of
spatial memory.

252
15:54
It's going to be all you retain
from this course.

253
15:56
Memory books on how to remember
people's names usually try to

254
16:03
exploit this sort of thing when
you try to get poetry or

255
16:08
dramatic images.
So, the memory books always

256
16:12
typically involve somebody--like
you meet somebody with very

257
16:16
spiky hair and they say,
"My name is Mr.

258
16:18
Fish" and then you
remember--you think of their--of

259
16:21
a big fish impaled on their
hair.

260
16:23
And then whenever you see them
you remember their name.

261
16:26
It only really works for names
like "Fish" but [laughter]

262
16:30
the idea is you try to generate
vivid imagery.

263
16:33
When stuck with a situation
where you have to remember ten

264
16:37
letters, turn it into a song
where--or a dirty poem where

265
16:42
each of the letters is the first
words of it.

266
16:45
When having to remember
something that seems totally

267
16:49
arbitrary, try to figure out a
grand and obscene image that

268
16:53
will come to mind easily.
And this is how--these are one

269
16:57
way to get things into memory.
At a deep level though,

270
17:00
the way to get things into
memory, and this applies to this

271
17:05
course no less than anything
else,

272
17:07
is by understanding
the--understanding it.

273
17:10
I'm going to read you something
and I want you to try your best

274
17:14
to remember what I tell you.
These are not going to be

275
17:18
strings of numbers.
These are going to be--This is

276
17:21
going to be a series of
sentences: "A newspaper is

277
17:24
better than a magazine.
A seashore is a better place

278
17:27
than the street.
At first it is better to run

279
17:30
than to walk.
You may have to try several

280
17:32
times.
It takes some skill but it's

281
17:33
easy to learn.
Even young children can enjoy

282
17:36
it.
Once successful,

283
17:37
complications are minimal.
Birds seldom get too close.

284
17:41
Rain, however,
soaks in very fast.

285
17:45
Too many people doing the same
things can also cause problems.

286
17:48
One needs lots of room.
If there are no complications,

287
17:51
it can be very peaceful.
Finally, a rock will serve as

288
17:54
an anchor.
If things break loose from it,

289
17:57
however, you will not have a
second chance."

290
18:01
And here is what I said .
This is murderously hard to

291
18:08
remember.
Now try it.

292
18:14
Knowing what this is about,
being able to put a context to

293
18:21
it helps the memory and helps it
come to mind.

294
18:27
[laughter] Okay.
So, this is about how to get

295
18:31
memory--how to get information
into your memory.

296
18:33
How do you get information out?
So, it's exam period.

297
18:39
You got the stuff presumably
into your head.

298
18:41
You have to get it out.
You have to retrieve it.

299
18:44
There is a court case.
You have to figure out--You

300
18:48
have to recount the crime that
you witnessed.

301
18:51
You see somebody and you want
to know his or her name.

302
18:55
And you heard it;
you just have to get it out.

303
18:58
Well, how do you do that?
Well, there's "retrieval cues."

304
19:02
Retrieval cues make sense.
Retrieval cues are just things

305
19:07
that have been associated with
what you--what you're trying to

306
19:13
remember.
If I have to remember to

307
19:15
replace the windows,
when I walk in to my living

308
19:18
room and see that a window is
cracked that will remind me to

309
19:21
replace the windows.
If I had a lunch date with you

310
19:25
and forgot about it,
when I see you,

311
19:27
"Oh, yeah.
We were supposed to get

312
19:29
together to have lunch."
Retrieval cues bring things

313
19:33
back but it's a little bit more
complicated than that.

314
19:38
There's a more general
relationship between encoding

315
19:41
and retrieval called the
"compatibility principle."

316
19:45
And what this means is you're
much better to remember

317
19:49
something in the context in
which you have learned it.

318
19:53
And this is also known as
"context-dependent memory" and

319
19:57
"state-dependent memory."
It's illustrated by one of the

320
20:00
strangest experiments in the
history of psychology where they

321
20:04
had people on a boat and then
they had them scuba dive

322
20:08
underwater.
And they taught them things

323
20:10
either on the boat or underwater
with things that they held up.

324
20:14
And then they tested them later.
And it turns out that you'll

325
20:18
remember it better if you're
tested on it in the context in

326
20:22
which you learned it.
And it might be because then

327
20:25
the retrieval cues help bring it
back.

328
20:27
But it's more general than that.
If you have to remember

329
20:31
something you learned in this
class, you will do better if you

330
20:35
try to think about the room in
which you learned it in.

331
20:39
You will do better on your
final exam if you were to take

332
20:42
it in this room than if you were
to take it in another room

333
20:47
because being in this room will
bring back the cues.

334
20:50
It's not just the environment.
People who learn things when

335
20:55
they're stoned remember them
better--keeping stoned at a sort

336
20:59
of a low-level that doesn't
disrupt other mental

337
21:02
activities--remember them better
when they're sort of stoned

338
21:06
again [laughter]
than if they're non-stoned.

339
21:09
Similarly--So,
if you study while you drink

340
21:13
you should tipple a little bit
before coming in to the Final

341
21:18
exam.
[laughter]

342
21:19
It's sort of like the "what
happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"

343
21:22
sort of result.
And so, similarly,

344
21:24
it even applies to moods in
that if you learn something when

345
21:28
depressed you have a slightly
better recovery of it when

346
21:32
you're in that same mood of
depression than when you're

347
21:36
elated.
And the idea is that part of

348
21:39
what memory is--part of what
recovering memory is is getting

349
21:44
back your original context in
which you learned it.

350
21:49
"Elaborative rehearsal" and
retrieval involves the

351
21:54
connections between different
things.

352
21:58
Elaborative rehearsal is that
the more you think about

353
22:03
something the easier it is to
remember.

354
22:06
If you have to think about--If
you have to remember something,

355
22:09
try to connect it to as many
things as possible.

356
22:11
Think of an image.
Make a joke out of it.

357
22:14
Imagine how you would explain
it to somebody else.

358
22:18
Imagine how the world--what the
world would be like if it wasn't

359
22:22
so.
And the idea is that this sort

360
22:24
of thinking about it makes
connections in your memory from

361
22:27
that thing you have to learn,
to other memories.

362
22:30
And so it makes it easier to
recover.

363
22:33
"Elaborative retrieval" refers
to a finding that when you want

364
22:39
to get something back out of
memory people tend to give up

365
22:45
too soon.
It turns out that there's a lot

366
22:49
of stuff that's in your memory
but it needs work to extract;

367
22:54
it needs various sort of
searching strategies.

368
22:58
One study asked people who were
considerably older than you to

369
23:03
remember their high school
classmates.

370
23:06
And in the first pass people
were terrible.

371
23:09
Maybe they had a couple of
friends they kept in touch with.

372
23:11
Otherwise, pretty bad.
And this is a good experiment

373
23:15
because you could use high
school yearbooks to judge

374
23:18
whether or not they get it
right.

375
23:19
But then what you do is you
tell the person,

376
23:22
"Look.
Keep trying.

377
23:24
Were you--What sort of--Who was
your teacher?

378
23:28
What sort of clubs did you
belong to?

379
23:29
What sort of sports you--did
you participate in?

380
23:31
How did you get to school?
How did you get from school?

381
23:35
What did you do during lunch?
What did you do during break?"

382
23:39
And you keep ask--"Do you
know--have any friends whose

383
23:41
letter--whose last name began
with ‘B,' with ‘C,' with

384
23:44
‘D'?"
And you keep pushing and

385
23:46
pushing and pushing.
And over the span of time

386
23:49
things come back.
Again, it's not true that you

387
23:53
never forget.
There is honest to God

388
23:55
forgetting but sometimes you
think you forget and it's

389
23:58
because you haven't looked long
enough.

390
24:00
There's a real physical notion
of searching for the right

391
24:03
answer.
We've talked about retrieval.

392
24:07
Oh.
Every class I've given somebody

393
24:11
asks either in class or by
e-mail what about déjà vu?

394
24:16
And déjà vu is a feeling that
an event has happened before.

395
24:22
So, you're looking at me and
I'm lecturing and you say,

396
24:25
"I've heard this before.
I know this before."

397
24:28
You see somebody and say,
"I've been in this situation

398
24:31
before."
This is not evidence for

399
24:33
psychic powers,
[laughter]

400
24:35
which many people say it is,
but nobody really knows why

401
24:40
this exists.
We know, and this is a clue,

402
24:43
it's worse with frontal lobe
damage.

403
24:45
If you get damage to this part
of the brain,

404
24:48
you get a lot more déjà vu
experiences.

405
24:50
I asked some experts in memory,
including Marcia Johnson who is

406
24:54
chair of our department,
what the best explanation for

407
24:58
déjà vu is.
And the answer she gave,

408
25:01
the--say one big theory,
goes like this.

409
25:05
Déjà vu is a feeling that
it's happened before.

410
25:08
The answer is it has happened
before.

411
25:11
It's happened half a second ago.
And so what happens is

412
25:16
sometimes there is a glitch,
a disturbance in the force.

413
25:22
I don't know.
There's a glitch [laughter]

414
25:25
and you are talking and then
something happens to you and you

415
25:28
put it in your memory.
But it's as if you don't put

416
25:31
the stamp on it of what time and
what date.

417
25:34
So, you're talking to me and
then you store it in memory but

418
25:38
you don't store it in memory as
happening right now.

419
25:42
Then half a second goes by and
you're talking to me and you

420
25:44
say, "This is strangely
familiar."

421
25:46
And that's one theory of what
goes on in déjà vu.

422
25:51
Okay.
So far, there's the sort of

423
25:54
good news – remembering –
but then there's bad news –

424
25:57
forgetting.
How many people can remember,

425
26:00
without looking down at your
notes, at least two of the

426
26:02
numbers I gave you earlier?

427
26:04


428
26:08
How many people can remember at
least four?

429
26:12
Oh, impressive.
If I asked you in an hour,

430
26:16
the number would go down.
These are sort of statistics in

431
26:19
a similar experiment.
And this graph illustrates that

432
26:23
people forget.
Over time, you'll forget.

433
26:27
Why do you forget?
Why is there forgetting at all?

434
26:31
Well, there's different
explanations for this.

435
26:33
One explanation is your brain's
a physical thing,

436
26:38
it's a physical piece of meat,
and it kind of goes bad.

437
26:43
Physical things decay.
And so, the memory traces that

438
26:47
are laid onto your brain will
just decay over time.

439
26:50
A second answer is interference.
So, remember those numbers?

440
26:56
Here's a few more:
114,81, 66,42.

441
27:01
Well, the more information that
comes in that's similar to the

442
27:04
stuff you're trying to remember,
it blocks your recovery of

443
27:08
original information.
So your ability to remember

444
27:12
something can be impaired by
learning more things which are

445
27:16
related to it because they get
confused in memory.

446
27:21
Finally, and maybe this is most
interesting, there are changes

447
27:24
in retrieval cues.
So, the more time goes by the

448
27:27
more the world changes.
And if your memory is to some

449
27:30
extent dependent on cues
bringing it back to life,

450
27:34
then the change in retrieval
cues can make it more difficult

451
27:40
to recall certain things.
This leads to a puzzle where

452
27:46
there's considerable scientific
debate over the case of

453
27:50
childhood amnesia.
And the case of childhood

454
27:54
amnesia is--doesn't refer to
when a child gets brain damage

455
27:58
and gets amnesia.
What it refers to is people

456
28:01
have a difficult time recovering
very early memories.

457
28:05
I want people to just take a
second and try to think back on

458
28:10
what your first memory is and
roughly how old you were.

459
28:14


460
28:20
How many people don't think you
have a first memory until you

461
28:25
were about five years old or
older?

462
28:28
Okay.
How many people think you have

463
28:33
the first memory of around age
four or younger?

464
28:37
How many people think you have
the first memory of around age

465
28:41
three or younger?
Two or younger?

466
28:45
How many of you think you have
the first memory when you were

467
28:48
about one years old or younger?
And I'm not asking about past

468
28:52
lives but that [laughs]
happened last year.

469
28:56
How old is your--roughly your
first memory do you think?

470
29:01
How old?
Student:

471
29:03
Between one and two.
Professor Paul Bloom:

472
29:05
Between one and two?
Anybody think they could beat

473
29:08
that?
Same guy?

474
29:10
Yeah.
Student: One.

475
29:12
Professor Paul Bloom:
One.

476
29:16
[laughter] Anybody else?
The literature is unclear on

477
29:22
this because it's very difficult
to test people's recollections

478
29:26
of their first memories.
If I'm to ask people about

479
29:30
their first memories,
they'll often say,

480
29:32
"Oh, yeah.
I remember I was in this room

481
29:35
and there was a crib and I'm
going ‘Ga ga,

482
29:39
goo goo' [laughter]
and I was on the potty.

483
29:42
I was walking.
I was so cute.

484
29:44
I remember it."
It's very difficult to tell

485
29:48
and, as we'll discuss in some
detail, there are a lot of

486
29:51
reasons to distrust people when
they--not that they're lying but

487
29:55
to distrust the accuracy of
people's memories.

488
29:59
We also know from studies about
trauma where people have

489
30:04
terrible experiences when
they're one or two.

490
30:08
Typically, this trauma is not
remembered later on.

491
30:11
People know of trauma because
they're told about it but they

492
30:16
don't typically remember it with
any accuracy.

493
30:19
Even children--older children
don't remember back beyond that

494
30:23
age.
Nobody knows why childhood

495
30:25
amnesia occurs.
Nobody knows why it's very

496
30:28
difficult to recover memories
before about the age of three.

497
30:32
One theory is that the
retrieval cues change radically.

498
30:36
I had a friend of mine who's a
clinical psychologist and he

499
30:39
suggested a new form of therapy
where they make these giant

500
30:42
tables and chairs and then they
bring you in to the office and

501
30:45
you're standing there with these
giant tables and chairs

502
30:48
[laughter]
and all these memories of being

503
30:50
a baby would come flooding back.
[laughter]

504
30:53
And he dropped out of the field
and-- [laughter]

505
30:57
Really, but it's such a cool
idea.

506
31:00
Some people think language is
to blame.

507
31:03
So a child, a baby,
starts out with no spoken or

508
31:08
signed language.
Language comes to be learned at

509
31:11
around one, two,
and three, and it might be that

510
31:15
the learning of a language
reformats your memory.

511
31:18
And once the memory is
reformatted it can't go back to

512
31:22
the previous state prior to
language in the end.

513
31:25
It could be neural maturation.
It could be that those memory

514
31:30
parts of the brains grow around
age two or three that just

515
31:34
weren't there prior to that.
And nobody really knows.

516
31:39
It's a fascinating research
area why--about memory changes

517
31:44
early on.
Another case of memory failure

518
31:48
is brain damage.
And brain damage comes in a

519
31:52
couple of flavors.
There is retrograde amnesia;

520
31:56
"retro" for past.
Retrograde amnesia is when you

521
32:00
lose some memory of the past.
This could be in a case where

522
32:04
you get some sort of head trauma
and you lose memory of your

523
32:07
entire episodic memory.
But typically,

524
32:09
if you have any sort of serious
accident that involves you

525
32:13
losing consciousness you'll have
a blackout of some period prior

526
32:18
to that,
say, blow to the head.

527
32:20
And the reason for this is as
you're having these experiences

528
32:25
now they need to kind of get
consolidated into your brain.

529
32:30
Your brain needs to rewire and
catch up to the experiences

530
32:33
you're having.
A sudden blow to the head will

531
32:36
knock you unconscious and then
the memories that have happened

532
32:40
immediately prior will not get
consolidated and they'll be lost

533
32:44
forever.
Another sort of memory is

534
32:46
anterograde amnesia and this was
the case of--This happens in

535
32:51
Korsakoff's syndrome.
It happens to a very famous

536
32:55
patient known as H.M.
who actually lives in Hartford,

537
32:58
Connecticut.
And it happened to Clive

538
33:01
Wearing, the film you saw last
class.

539
33:05
And this sort of amnesia is a
sort of amnesia where you lose

540
33:10
the ability to form new
memories.

541
33:13
And so you live in a perpetual
present, unable to accumulate

542
33:17
new memories.
But it's actually a little bit

543
33:21
more complicated than that.
What happens is--And this was

544
33:25
an exciting discovery about
these patients that led to some

545
33:28
real insights about normal
memory--What happens is--And

546
33:32
this is the brain damage in
these cases,

547
33:34
the temporal lobe and the
hippocampus, very useful for

548
33:38
spatial memory you'll know.
One discovery made about people

549
33:42
who couldn't form new memories
is that they could form new

550
33:46
memories, but of certain types.
So for example,

551
33:50
this is a task here involving
filling in a star while looking

552
33:56
in to a mirror.
And if I asked you to do it

553
33:59
you'd find it pretty difficult.
It's just kind of difficult to

554
34:01
do.
You'd be clumsy at it.

555
34:03
You bring in an amnesic who
can't form new memories and you

556
34:07
say, "Hey.
I want you to try something new.

557
34:09
I want you to try this star
game."

558
34:11
He'd say, "Okay.
I've never seen it before but

559
34:14
I'll do it."
Tries it.

560
34:15
Does very badly.
You bring him in and over and

561
34:19
over again--Each time he does it
he starts off by saying,

562
34:23
"I've never seen this before.
I'll--I'm sure I'll give it a

563
34:27
try" but he gets better and
better at it.

564
34:30
And this is known as implicit
memory.

565
34:33
The claim is that in these
sorts of cases you lose the

566
34:37
abilities to form explicit
conscious memories that you're

567
34:42
aware of, that you understand.
But some sorts of memories

568
34:46
persist and you are able to form
them.

569
34:50
This has actually been
illustrated in a couple of

570
34:54
dramatic movies,
one of them a very bad dramatic

571
34:57
movie [laughs]
where Drew Barrymore loses the

572
35:01
ability to form new memories and
somehow falls in love with Adam

573
35:06
Sandler.
[laughs]

574
35:08
Definitely don't watch that.
But a very good movie called

575
35:12
"Memento," which is about a
character who loses his ability

576
35:17
to form new memories while
trying to track down his wife's

577
35:22
killer.
"Memento" is a movie which is

578
35:24
fascinating because it's told
backwards.

579
35:27
But throughout "Memento"
there's another story told

580
35:30
forwards.
And I like this story because

581
35:33
it very dramatically illustrates
what does, and what is and is

582
35:37
not impaired in cases of severe
memory damage.

583
35:41
So, I'm going to show you a
couple of clips that illustrate

584
35:44
the disassociation from
"Memento."

585
35:45


586
35:49
Those of you who have seen the
movie know that this ends up

587
35:53
quite tragically for Sammy.
I highly recommend the movie.

588
35:58
We've dealt right now with two
sorts of failures of memory.

589
36:02
One is everyday failure of
memory when you forget.

590
36:06
How many of you remember three
or more of the numbers I

591
36:13
originally presented?
Yeah?

592
36:17
Go ahead.
Student: [inaudible]

593
36:20
Professor Paul Bloom:
Fourteen, 59,11.

594
36:23
Is that right?
[laughs] Fine.

595
36:28
[laughter] All right.
I'm going to ask you again in a

596
36:34
month.
[laughter]

597
36:36
Well, people are supposed to
forget [laughter]

598
36:38
and some things will--you will
forget.

599
36:41
That's normal forgetting.
A second case is forgetting due

600
36:45
to brain damage.
Forgetting due to brain damage

601
36:48
is exotic and unusual but it's
interesting in that it

602
36:52
illustrates some more general
themes about how the mind works.

603
36:56
Remember one theme of this
course is we're going to look at

604
37:00
exotic cases like the case of
Clive Wearing,

605
37:03
not just because they're
interesting in their own right

606
37:07
but sometimes by looking at the
extremes we could learn

607
37:10
something about how normal
people's normal,

608
37:13
intact minds and brains work.
The third case of forgetting is

609
37:19
more interesting and it
actually--Well,

610
37:24
I want to do a little trial
here.

611
37:28
What I want to do is I want
to--You to listen to three

612
37:33
children describe an event that
happened.

613
37:37
I want you to come to
some--your own guess.

614
37:40
Imagine you were a judge,
you were a childcare worker,

615
37:44
you wanted to see--I want you
to be--come to your own guess

616
37:48
about who you believe and what
you think happened.

617
37:51
[inaudible]
[laughter]

618
37:52
You've heard three children.
Who do you believe?

619
37:55
Who believes--There's three of
them, one, two,

620
37:58
three.
Who believes the first one?

621
38:02
Who believes the second one?
Who believes the third one?

622
38:09
Sort of an even split.

623
38:10


624
38:18
Twenty-three hundred experts
were shown these films and asked

625
38:23
about the different actions,
whether or not the person

626
38:27
ripped the book,
messed up the bear,

627
38:29
tossed the book in the air and,
as you could see,

628
38:33
the majority thought that he
did.

629
38:36
This is work done by Steve Ceci
who was gracious enough to lend

630
38:43
me the film to use for teaching
purposes.

631
38:48
It turns out the second girl
was right.

632
38:50
Absolutely nothing happened.
[laughter]

633
38:55
The teacher said,
"There is somebody named Sam

634
38:58
Stone who's going to come in."
A guy walks in and says,

635
39:03
"Hi," walks around and leaves.
[laughter]

636
39:08
The first and third children
had their memories implanted,

637
39:11
not through any sort of science
fiction means.

638
39:14
They had their memories
implanted--Well,

639
39:17
they had their memories
implanted like this.

640
39:20
Some of the children would just
ask questions.

641
39:23
The interviewer,
by the way, was herself unaware

642
39:26
of what happened so the
interviewer was a perfectly

643
39:29
naive interviewer.
And it turns out if you just

644
39:32
interview children and you ask
them questions about whether the

645
39:35
book was ripped,
"Did you see him?

646
39:36
Did he really do it?"
they don't say anything.

647
39:40
They didn't see anything and
they won't say anything.

648
39:43
Other children were told about
Sam Stone.

649
39:47
They were told a stereotype
about Sam Stone – that he's

650
39:51
very clumsy and he tends to rip
things and he trips and he

651
39:54
breaks things and he spills
things.

652
39:57
And in fact,
the third child mentioned that

653
39:59
in passing.
He said, "He always does that."

654
40:02
Just knowing this about Sam
Stone tends to raise the

655
40:06
proportion of kids who say,
for instance,

656
40:09
that he ripped the book.
Other children were given

657
40:13
suggestions.
They were given suggestive

658
40:16
questioning.
They were a series of leading

659
40:19
questions like,
"Oh.

660
40:21
Sam Stone came in?
Did he rip a book while he was

661
40:25
there?"
And still more children got

662
40:28
both.
And in fact,

663
40:30
the children you saw were from
this group.

664
40:34
They heard Sam Stone being
described as a clumsy fellow and

665
40:36
they were given a series of
suggestive questionings.

666
40:39
In this condition they were
given several suggestive

667
40:42
questionings over the period of
several months.

668
40:45
These children,
like the first child and the

669
40:48
third child, are not lying.
They honestly believe that Sam

670
40:53
Stone came in and did these
things.

671
40:57
Also they believe it and
they're so convincing in their

672
41:01
belief that experts,
including police officers and

673
41:05
child caseworkers and judges and
lawyers, find these children to

674
41:11
be extremely believable.
And I think they probably find

675
41:15
them to be extremely believable
because the children are not

676
41:18
lying.
They really believe they saw

677
41:20
what they saw.
But these memories were

678
41:23
implanted.
And Ceci, and many other

679
41:25
investigators,
study how memories can be

680
41:28
implanted in people's minds
through suggestion and through

681
41:33
leading questions.
It turns out that the same sort

682
41:37
of experiments and the same sort
of research has been done with

683
41:42
considerable success in
implanting false memories in

684
41:46
adults.
There are dramatic cases of

685
41:49
people remembering terrible
crimes and confessing to them

686
41:53
when actually,
they didn't commit them.

687
41:57
And this is not because they
are lying.

688
42:02
It's not even because they're,
in some obvious sense,

689
42:05
deranged or schizophrenic or
delusional.

690
42:07
Rather, they have persuaded
themselves, or more often been

691
42:12
persuaded by others,
that these things have actually

692
42:16
happened.
Psychologists have studied in

693
42:19
the laboratory how one could do
this, how one can implant

694
42:22
memories in other people.
And some things are sort of

695
42:26
standard.
Suppose I was to tell you a

696
42:28
story about a trip I took to the
dentist or a visit I took to--or

697
42:34
a time when I ate out at a
restaurant and I'm to omit

698
42:38
certain details.
I omit the fact that I paid the

699
42:41
bill in a restaurant,
let's say or I finished the

700
42:44
meal and then I went home.
Still, you will tend to fill in

701
42:48
the blanks.
You'll tend to fill in the

702
42:50
blanks with things you know.
So, you might remember this

703
42:53
later saying,
"Okay.

704
42:54
He told me he finished eating,
paid the bill and left,"

705
42:57
because paying the bill is what
you do in a restaurant.

706
43:00
This is benign enough.
You fill in the blanks.

707
43:03
You also can integrate
suppositions made by others.

708
43:11
And the clearest case of this
is eyewitness testimony.

709
43:15
And the best research on this
has been done by Elizabeth

710
43:18
Loftus who has done a series of
studies,

711
43:21
some discussed in the textbook,
showing how people's memories

712
43:25
can be swayed by leading
questions.

713
43:28
And it can be extremely subtle.
In one experiment,

714
43:32
the person was just asked in
the course of a series of

715
43:36
questions--shown a scene where
there's a car accident and asked

716
43:41
either,
"Did you see a broken

717
43:43
headlight?"
or "Did you see the broken

718
43:47
headlight?"
The ‘the' presupposes that

719
43:50
there was a broken headlight and
in fact, the people told--asked,

720
43:54
"Did you see the broken
headlight?"

721
43:56
later on are more likely to
remember one.

722
43:59
It creates an image and they
fill it in.

723
44:01
In another study,
she would show film segments

724
44:05
and then ask,
"Did you see the children

725
44:08
getting on the school bus?"
Now, there was no school bus

726
44:12
but people who hear that
question later on when asked,

727
44:15
"Did you see a school bus in
the film?"

728
44:17
are more likely to say yes.
In another study,

729
44:20
she would show people film
segments and ask them either,

730
44:24
"How fast were the cars going
when they hit each other?"

731
44:28
or "How fast were the cars
going when they smashed into

732
44:34
each other?"
A week later she'd bring people

733
44:38
back in to the laboratory and
ask, "Did you see any broken

734
44:42
glass?"
Those who hear a smash tend to

735
44:45
see the broken glass more than
those who hear a hit because the

736
44:49
question has changed their
memory,

737
44:51
making it more of a dramatic
event.

738
44:56
Hypnosis is the clearest case
where there's a sort of

739
45:01
reconstructive effort led
by--led as a result of leading

740
45:06
and probing questions.
Some of you are readily

741
45:11
hypnotizable and you can be
hypnotized.

742
45:15
And what we would learn about a
past event from hypnotizing you

743
45:19
will not necessarily then be
inaccurate.

744
45:22
What hypnotizing does is it
makes people very willing to

745
45:25
cooperate.
Unfortunately,

746
45:26
it isn't as if there is a
memory storage there where you

747
45:30
could just go through and look
as in the movies where you just

748
45:33
say,
"What's the license plate?"

749
45:35
The person's hypnotized and
then the flashback comes in and

750
45:38
then they zoom in on the license
plate.

751
45:40
Memory doesn't work that way.
What happens is--What somebody

752
45:43
will do in a hypnotizable state
is they'll be very eager to

753
45:47
please the hypnotist.
And so they'll make stuff up.

754
45:50
And people under hypnosis just
make stuff up.

755
45:54
And they do very
enthusiastically and very

756
45:57
believably make stuff up.
This is particularly the case

757
46:01
with hypnotic regression when we
ask you to go back to your sixth

758
46:05
birthday party,
for instance.

759
46:07
And what's great as a
developmental psychologist is if

760
46:10
I ask you to go back to your
fourth birthday party and you're

761
46:13
hypnotizable you'll be oh,
just like a four-year-old

762
46:16
except you won't be like a real
four-year-old.

763
46:19
What you'll be like is an
adult's notion of what a

764
46:21
four-year-old is supposed to be.
In fact, this has happened in

765
46:25
the extreme case with hypnotic
regression where people claim to

766
46:30
speak languages like from
ancient Egypt.

767
46:33
And linguists love these
studies because you don't--of

768
46:36
course you don't really sound
like you're speaking a language

769
46:39
from ancient Egypt.
What you sound is like a North

770
46:43
American who believes he's
speaking a language from ancient

771
46:48
Egypt so they're,
"nonsense sounds."

772
46:52
[laughter]
And so what it makes you

773
46:54
is--Hypnotism brings out the
actor in you.

774
46:57
It makes you want to give a
persuasive account of what

775
47:01
happened.
And so hypnotism is just an

776
47:04
extreme form of what normally
happens in eyewitness testimony.

777
47:10
Repressed memories.
We could devote a class--We

778
47:13
could devote a semester to the
very heated debate in the United

779
47:18
States mostly about repressed
memories.

780
47:21
There are many adults who have
claimed to have experienced

781
47:27
traumatic sexual abuse.
In some cases,

782
47:30
this is unexceptional from a
memory point of view.

783
47:33
People know this happened to
them.

784
47:35
They've always known it happens
to them and then they tell

785
47:38
people about it.
But there's a subset of cases

786
47:41
where people have had no memory
up to a point of what happened

787
47:45
to them.
Then they go to a psychologist

788
47:48
or a psychiatrist;
they undergo questioning,

789
47:52
often using hypnotic
techniques;

790
47:54
and then they recover a memory
of past traumatic sexual abuse.

791
47:59
And what this is--what makes
this so debatable,

792
48:02
and there is a debate about
this.

793
48:04
I don't want to try to preclude
it one way or another.

794
48:07
What makes this debatable is
some psychologists believe that,

795
48:10
in at least some cases,
these memories are real and

796
48:12
they have been repressed through
a Freudian mechanism – that

797
48:16
they're too terrible to bring to
consciousness,

798
48:18
and the therapy brings them out
into real life.

799
48:22
But most psychologists believe
that these memories cannot be

800
48:26
trusted, that these memories are
created through the actions of

801
48:30
the therapist.
And so, there's actually

802
48:33
considerable psychological and
legal battles over the veracity

803
48:37
of the therapists where women
who have claimed to have

804
48:41
sexual--be sexually abused,
for instance,

805
48:44
have pressed criminal charges
against their fathers on the

806
48:47
basis of false memories.
Similarly, people who have been

807
48:50
accused of sexual abuse have
pressed criminal charges against

808
48:54
psychiatrists claiming that
these psychiatrists have

809
48:57
implanted the memories into
their sons and daughters.

810
49:00
It is controversial whether
memories are ever repressed.

811
49:04
What isn't controversial is
that, for at least some cases,

812
49:08
you can implant false memories
in people,

813
49:12
not because you're a sinister
or evil person but because you

814
49:15
really believed something
happened.

815
49:17
And you talked to them about it
and then you caused these

816
49:20
memories to come into being.
A final case is flashbulb

817
49:24
memories.
I asked this early in the

818
49:26
semester.
I'll ask it again.

819
49:27
How many of you remember where
you were on September 11,2001?

820
49:33
Is there anybody who doesn't
remember where they were on

821
49:37
September 11,2001?
It would be interesting.

822
49:40
It was a socially relevant
event, but here's the problem

823
49:44
with these flashbulb memories.
Flashbulb memories are the idea

824
49:49
that these memories being so
vivid, and they are vivid for

825
49:52
many of us--exactly where we
stood, what happened;

826
49:55
well, they can't really be
trusted.

827
49:58
And here is why not.
Because they are such important

828
50:02
events, I bet many of you have
actually heard the question

829
50:07
before, "Where were you on
September 11^(th)?"

830
50:10
and talked about it.
What happens in these

831
50:14
conversations is stories change.
I have my--I knew where I was

832
50:19
on September 11^(th).
My wife knew where she was.

833
50:22
But I spent as much time
listening to her talk about it

834
50:25
as I spent time me talking about
it.

835
50:28
And now maybe my memory is
actually of her experience and

836
50:31
not mine.
It's not--For all of these

837
50:34
cases, the temptation you have
to resist is saying,

838
50:38
"Yes.
I know memories can be swayed.

839
50:41
I know they could be distorted
and everything but,

840
50:45
you see, I really am sure that
happened."

841
50:47
You have to resist that
temptation because there are so

842
50:50
many cases we know,
including the tape of the girls

843
50:53
that we just saw,
where people are entirely sure

844
50:56
things happened.
And we know full well that they

845
50:59
didn't exist.
Being sure is no guarantee that

846
51:02
a memory isn't false,
reconstructed or even

847
51:05
implanted.
So, this part of memory has

848
51:09
three main morals.
There are many types of

849
51:12
memories.
I talked about short-term

850
51:14
memory, long-term memory.
I talked about implicit memory

851
51:17
and explicit memory.
These are sort of separable

852
51:20
sort of memories.
You could break one while

853
51:22
having the other one impaired.
Arguably, there are brain

854
51:25
systems dedicated to memory for
faces, memory for everyday

855
51:30
objects, memory for spatial
locations.

856
51:33
The key to remembering is
organization and understanding.

857
51:39
Introduction to "X" courses,
including Introduction to

858
51:44
Psychology courses,
are among the hardest courses

859
51:48
at Yale.
And the reason why is there is

860
51:51
just a lot of material that is
diverse and you have to command

861
51:56
each aspect separately.
The easiest courses at Yale

862
52:00
tend to be highfalutin seminars
where you kind of have enough of

863
52:03
a background that everything
is--can be clear and

864
52:06
understandable.
The more you understand

865
52:09
something, the easier you'll
remember it.

866
52:11
And finally,
you can't trust some of your

867
52:15
memories.
Your reading response for this

868
52:20
week is you have to use your
powers for good and not for

869
52:27
evil,
[laughter]

870
52:29
though if you manage to succeed
at this I will be very

871
52:32
impressed.
[laughter]

872
52:34
But you have to describe,
based on the lecture materials

873
52:37
and the readings,
how to implant a false memory.

874
52:41


875
52:47
We have a few minutes.
Any questions on memory.

876
52:52
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

877
52:55
Professor Paul Bloom: Uh
huh.

878
52:58
Hey.
Please-- Student:

879
53:02
[inaudible]
Is that long-term sensory

880
53:07
memory?
Professor Paul Bloom:

881
53:10
The example is,
"What sort of memory is it when

882
53:12
you know how to play the piano?"
And it's a very good question.

883
53:15
It is long-term memory because
you might know how to do a

884
53:19
concerto or a song and then you
have it stored in your head and

885
53:22
you carry it around with you.
You'll remember it a year from

886
53:25
now, two years from now.
It is long-term memory but it

887
53:28
is also an excellent example of
implicit memory because you know

888
53:32
how to do it but you could do it
unconsciously without attending

889
53:36
to it.
It's not sensory but it's as

890
53:38
if, put it crudely,
that your fingers know and not

891
53:42
your mind.
We have time for one more

892
53:45
question.
Yes.

893
53:47
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

894
53:50
The question is about
photographic memory.

895
53:52
There are a lot of claims about
photographic memory.

896
53:55
My understanding is they do not
tend to be substantiated.

897
53:59
Sometimes photographic memory,
and this came up when we talked

898
54:03
about autism a few classes ago,
is linked with savant-like

899
54:07
skills.
People who have severe

900
54:09
impairments in some ways may
have photographic memories in

901
54:12
others.
I am not convinced that

902
54:14
photographic memory in the sense
that you see something,

903
54:17
you take a picture of it,
you hold it in memory really

904
54:21
exists.
I think there may be one or two

905
54:23
case studies that suggest it
might be real but I think it's

906
54:27
controversial.
Okay.

907
54:29
We have a guest lecturer on
Wednesday.

908
54:32
Dean Peter Salovey will talk to
us about love.

909
